We need to create a system that encourages and supports female filmmakers. We need to make sure that female directors are given the same chance as male directors to succeed in the industry. It's also important to make sure that female directors are given equal pay and recognition for their work.\r\n\r\nJournalist: What advice would you give young female filmmakers who want to pursue a career in the film industry?\r\n\r\nFemale Film Director: I would tell them to never give up.

The algorithm works by using an encoder-decoder network to compress the low-resolution image into a latent space representation, and then using a generator network to upsample the latent space representation into a high-resolution version of the image. This upsampling process is done iteratively, allowing the algorithm to produce high-resolution versions of the image with minimal artifacts. \r\n\r\nSome of the potential advantages of this algorithm include improved upscaling, more efficient image compression, and better content generation in creative fields such as CGI and digital art. Upscaling with the algorithm results in smoother images with fewer artifacts than traditional upscaling algorithms, while more efficient image compression can be achieved due to the improved quality of the generated images. Additionally, the algorithm can be used in creative fields to generate higher quality content than would otherwise be possible. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are some potential limitations to the algorithm. For instance, the algorithm requires a large amount of data to train the CNNs, which can make it expensive and time-consuming to use. Additionally, the algorithm can be limited by the quality of the data it is trained on, meaning that if the data is of low quality, the generated images will also be of lower"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 322}

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles.

Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D√ºrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing.
