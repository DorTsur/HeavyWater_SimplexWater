Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

Credit score is a numerical representation of an individual's ability to repay debts, based on thier credit history, payment history, credit utilization, anbd otehr factors. Credit utilization, on the otehr hand, refers to the amount of credit being used compared to the total credit availiable tothe individual.\n\nThe relationship between credit score and credit utilization is complex, but ther is a direct relationship between ther two. In general, thge lower the credit utilization, the higher the credit score. This is because creditors view individuals with low credit utilization as being more responsibile and less likely to default on their debts.\n\nTo illustrate this relatiopnship, let's consider an example:\n\nAssume John has a credit card iwth a $1,000 limit andd he has a balance of $200. His credit utilization is 20% ($200 / $1,000). If John has a good payment hstory and no late payments, his credit score may improve over time. However, if he continues to use 20% or more of his availabe credit, his credit score may not improve significantly, or even decrease.\n\nConversely, if John has a low credit utilization of 5% or less, his credit score may improve faster.

How is credit utiltization calculated?    Is it average utilization over the month, or total amount owed/credit_limit per month? It depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies. It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends. Being debt free has its advantages... but if your goal is to raise your credit score, then having a low utilization rate is a good metric.

Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio?

To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares.

Here's how it works:\n\n1. Identify investments that have experienced a loss: Review your investment portfolio and identify any investments that hvea declined in value anbd resulted in a loss.\n2. Harvest the loss: Sell tje investment that has experianced a loss to realize the loss. This can be done by selling the security in a taxable brokerage account or within a tax-deferred retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA.\n3. Use the loss to offset gains: Once you have harvested teh loss, you can use it to offset gains frome other investments. For example, if you haev a long-term capital gain frome the sale of another investment, you can use the loss to reduce the ammount of taxes owed on tyhat gain.\n4. Carry forward any excess losses: If the loss exceeds the amount of gains you have to offset, yuo can carry forward the excess loss to future", "answers": ["Capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods. An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss. A sale of any asset held for over a year to your day, and sold at a loss, will create a loss that is long-term. When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040.

The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%!

Thsi means that tjhe order iwll only be executed if the security can be bought or sold at tje specified price or a more favorable price.

(This is known as \"going long\", as opposed to \"going short\").  For the normal investor, a stop order (of either kind) is only used when selling. A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

Here's a brief overview of eahc option and how they relate to oil prices per barrel:\n\n1. ETFs: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that track an index, sector, or asset class, such as oil. ETFs offer exposure to oil prices without directly owning physical oil.

Note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out, or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it, which might not be very useful to you. As most traders don't want really any oil, that might happen automatically or by default, but you need to make sure of that.

Since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well, both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock.  Essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position. If the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating, or reducing, the loss made on the short sale.

But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank.

One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

It is calculated by dividing tje property's annual net operating income (NOI) by its purchase price or valuation. The resulting percentage represents the expected return on investment in the property, expressed as a rate per year. For example, if a property has an NOI of $100,000 and a purchase price of $1 million, teh capitalization rate would be 10% ($100,000 / $1 million = 0.10).\n\nOn the other hand, net profit margin is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a business or investment as a percentage of its revenue. It is calculated by dividing the business's net profits by its total revenue. Net profit margin is a measure of how much of each dollar of revenue the business keeps as profit, after deducting all expenses. For example, if a business has total revenue of $100,000 and net profits of $20,000, its net profit margin would be 20% ($20,000 / $100,", "answers": ["Both of these terms do refer to your profit; they're just different ways of evaluating it.

If house A costs $1M and you'll make $50K (profit) from it yearly, and house B costs $1.33M and you'll make $65K (profit) from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount-of-money-you-have-stuck-in-this-investment-and-unavailable-for-use-elsewhere. Profit margin, on the other hand, cares more about your ongoing expenses than about your total investment.  If it costs less to maintain property B than it does to maintain property A, then you could have something like: So B is a more efficient investment from the point of view of the fraction of your revenue you actually get to keep each year. Certainly you could think of the property's value as an opportunity cost and factor that into the net profit margin equation to get a more robust estimate of exactly how efficient your investment is.

By offering a joint checking/savings account that requires you to use your debit card, the bank is assuming that you'll keep more money in your account than you would in a standard checking-only account. Your higher balance translates into more money the bank can loan out or invest, which usually leads to higher profit for them. Businesses pay fees to the bank to accept debit cards. These fees represent another source of profit for the bank. The more you use your debit card, the more the bank earns in fees, so the bank encourages you to use your debit card more frequently through incentives like a higher interest rate or waiving fees on your account if you use your card enough.

Intrest on Debt: When indviduals, businesses, or governments borrow money, they must pay intrest on the borrowed amount. This interest is applied to the outstanding principal, causing the debt to grwo at a rate greater thna the inital borrowing.

These dividends are reinvested, increasing the total value of the investment, anbd generatting further returns through the compounding effect.\n3.

After all, their main role when you use them is to negotiate payments with creditors so you can pay off your debts.  In this case you have the funds to pay, so why make it any more complicated than it needs to be? To be honest, a 597 score is going to make it tough for you to find auto financing.  Whatever options you find, they'll charge pretty steep interest rates and have high payments because they'll keep you on as short a payment term as your finances will allow.  I would strongly suggest that you work on improving your score for awhile before trying to buy a car.  If you can, buy a car for cash.  You might not get much, but it will solve your transportation problem while you work on resolving your credit issues. Using a credit counselor won't have any impact on your credit score as far as the debts are concerned.  What will make a difference is not having them show as open collections, which is pretty bad.  You'll still take a hit for having gone to collections in the first place, but paying them off will mitigate at least some of the effect. I hope this helps.

When you put a deposit down on a car wiht a dealer, it is typically considered a security deposit that hten dealer holds until the sale is finalized. If you fail to secure financing for tjhe purchase of the car, thge dealer may have the right to keep your deposit.\n\nIn most cases, a dealer is entitlied to keep your deposit if yuo fail to secure financing andd do not complete the purchase of the vehicle. This is because the dealer has relied on your deposit to cover the costs associated with the sale, such as the cost of hten vehicle, financing fees, and any other expenses incurred during the purchasing process.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that dealers are onot able to keep your deposit indefinitely. In many states, dealers are required to follow specif regulations and procedures when it comes to handling deposits.

Financial advisors may be incentivized to recommend these products, even if they are nto necessarily tje best fit for the client.

Thsi can lead to recommendations that are not in the client's best interest.\n3. Sales targets: Finacial advisors may be pressured to meet sales targets or hit certain performance metrics.

So in essence, your Scotiabank advisor is not necessarily making bad decisions for you - but they are restricted in what they will offer, and will not tell you if there is a better product for you that Scotiabank doesn't sell.

Investment decisions: Investors use credit ratings to identify bonds, corporate debt, adn other investment products that are relatively safe adn have a lower probability of default. A higher credit rating often leads to lower borrowing costs and improved access to capital markets.\n3.

PayPal wants person-to-person payments to be free (except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt) but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments.

Eventually PayPal decoupled the question of \"is this a person-to-person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services?\" from the paypal account type.

On the other hand you would expect a stable company to maintain a similar value in real terms. So the dividend can be seen as real terms income.
