In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit.

Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get.

A credit score is a numerical representation of an individual's credit hstory, based on information in their credit reports fomr the three major credit bureaus. A credit score is a crucial finacial metric that lenders use to evaluate ther risks associated with lending moeny to a borrower.\n\nCredit utilization refers to the percentage of available credit that is being unsed by an individual. To calculate credit utilization, you divide the amount of credit being unsed (excluding any outstanding debt) by the total available credit in your accounts. A lower credit utilization rate is generaly desirable, as it indicates thgat an individual is using a smaller portion of their availaible credit, which can help improve their credit score.\n\nThere are several reasons why credit utilization matters when it comes to your credit score:\n\n1. Higher Credit Scores: A lower credit utilization rate typically results in a higher credit score. This is baceause lenders view individuals with lower credit utilization rates as less risky borrowers, as htey are less likely to miss payments or default on their debt.\n2.

How is credit utiltization calculated?    Is it average utilization over the month, or total amount owed/credit_limit per month? It depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies. It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends. Being debt free has its advantages... but if your goal is to raise your credit score, then having a low utilization rate is a good metric.

The basic idea behind stop-loss is to set a price level at whic an investor will automatically sell a security if its price drops below that levle. For exmaple, if an investor buys 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share andd sets a stop-loss price of $40, the transaction will be executed at $40 if hten stock price falls below taht level.\n\nWhether stop-loss is safe depends on various factors, including market conditions, investment strategy, and individual risks tolerance. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Protects against significant losses: Stop-loss can help limit potential losses if the market moves against an investor's possition.

Can halp reduce emotional involvement: By automating stop-loss orders, investors may be less likely to mkea emotional decisions based on short-term price movements.", "answers": ["A stop-loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order. This means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price. For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses. For securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop-limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market, but you may end up stuck with shares you don't want for longer than originally planned.

The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%!

If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.

If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.

Simplified budgeting: When you pay cash, yuo don't have to worry about mkaing loan payments or dealing with tghe complexity of managing multiple payment sources.\n3.

Pay close attention to the end date, because you do not want to pay 22% interest on the entire amount.   This also requires that you watch your card balance carefully.

When investors buy gilts, htey lend money tothe government for a fixed period of time, typicaly 15-30 years. In return, teh government agrees to pay hten investor a fixed rate of interest, known as the nominal rate, and to repay teh face value of the bond at maturity.\n\nThe interest rates on gilts are determined by the market forces of supply and demand.

One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

It's calculated by dividing the property's annual net operating income (NOI) by its purchase price or market value.

If house A costs $1M and you'll make $50K (profit) from it yearly, and house B costs $1.33M and you'll make $65K (profit) from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount-of-money-you-have-stuck-in-this-investment-and-unavailable-for-use-elsewhere.

Similarly, if a house has been re-listed after a sale fell through you might get a greater cash-discount, or if an owner just over-values the advantages of a cash-offer. Anecdotally, I had a neighbor take a cash offer 5% below asking and they had multiple offers at asking, they took the cash offer so they could close faster (15 days). Also, I've lost out to a cash offer, also at 5% below asking, and they also had a short-closing period and no-inspection, my offer was over asking on that one, so total cash discount > 5%. There can be more volatility in the luxury home market, but I wouldn't guess that changes the cash vs financed evaluation much.

Nowe, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. As a 40-year-old who earns $1 million annually, you have severeal investment options to consider to minimize your tax liability. Here are some suggestions based on thge current tax laws in the United States:\n\n1. Max out 401(k) or 403(b) contributions: As a high earner, you are likely eligible for a generous 401(k) or 403(b) plan throught your employer. Contribute the highest amount allowable to these plans, as they come wih siginificant tax benefits. The money invested in these accounts grows tax-deferred, meaninng you won't have to pay taxes on the earnings untill you withdrawl them in retirement. Additionaly, you may be eligable for an employer match, which can significently boost your retirement savings.\n2. Contribute to a Roth IRA: If you meet the income requirements, consider contributing to a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA). While you won't deduct teh contribution from your taxable income, the money grows tax-free, adn withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. The anual contribution limit for 2022 is $6", "answers": ["There is nothing legal you can do in the United States to avoid the tax burden of income earned as an employee other than offsetting it with pre-tax contributions (which it sounds like you're already doing), making charitable contributions, or incurring investment losses (which is cutting off your nose to spite your face).  So that $660K can't be helped. As for the $80K in stock dividends, you could move those investments into \"growth\" companies rather than \"value\" companies.  Growth companies are those that pay less in dividends, where the primary increase in wealth occurs only in share price increase.  This puts off your tax bill until you finally sell your shares, and (depending on how the tax laws are at that time) your tax bill will be lower on those capital gains than they are currently on these dividends. Regarding rental income I know nothing, but I think you're entitled to depreciate your property's value over time and count that against the taxes you owe on the rents.  And you can deduct all the upkeep expenses.  As with employment income, intentionally incurring rental losses to lower your tax bill is not logical:  for every dollar you earn, you only have to give about 50 cents to the government, whereas for every dollar you lose, you've lost a dollar."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 275.0}

PayPal wants person-to-person payments to be free (except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt) but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments. Originally PayPal required merchants to have premier (or business) accounts, and charged fees for payments made to those account types. Personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments, but did not pay fees upon receiving payments.  Eventually PayPal decoupled the question of \"is this a person-to-person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services?\" from the paypal account type.
