In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

Here's how they are related:\n\n1. Too high credit utilization can hurt your score: If you're useing too much of your available credit, it can negatively impact your credit score.

Is it better to use your card and pay off the bill completely every month? Yes. How is credit utiltization calculated?

It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends.

Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio?

However, whether tehy are safe or onot depends on various factors, which I will outline below.\n\nA stop-loss order is an order to sell a security wehn its price falls below a certain levle (known as ther stop price). The primary purpose of a stop-loss order is to limit potential losses by automatically closing a possition when it reaches a certain price levle. For example, if you buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 and set a stop-loss order at $40, tje broker will sell the shares when the price falls to $40, limiting your losses to $10 per share.\n\nNow, are stop-loss orders safe? Tje answer is complex, and it depends on severeal factors. Htere are some points to consider:\n\n1. Market volatility: Stop-loss orders are most effective in highly volatile markets, where price swings are signficiant. In such markets, stop-loss orders can help limit losses by automatically closing positions when the price falls to a certain levle.

This means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price. For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses. For securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop-limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market, but you may end up stuck with shares you don't want for longer than originally planned.

The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%!

A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.  There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity (number of shares) that the bond can be converted into.  If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.

Here's how it works:\n\nWhn a cardholder makes a payment, the payment is applied tothe outstanding balance. If the payment exceeds the balance, tghe excess amount is typicaly aplied as a credit towards the next billing cycle's balance. Htis is known as a \"credit balance.\"\n\nIn this case, teh card issuer may charge interest on the credit balance, even though the balance is less thna tjhe original amount of the payment. This is because the credit balance is considered a \"new\" balance, and interest is charged on the entire balance, including the porshan that exceeds thge originall balance.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an outstanding balance of $1000 on your credit card, and you make a payment of $1500. The excess $500 is aplied as a credit towards the enxt billing cycle's balance. In thsi case, the card issuer may charge interest on tghe full $1500, even though only $1000 is the original balance.\n\nIt's important to onot that not all credit cards charge interest on credit balances.

To revise the example you gave, let's say Jan 1. your account balance was $0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent $1,000.  Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared ~Jan.24 or Jan. 27.

So back to the example you gave--if your balance showed $1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged $2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of $2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared.

UK Gilts are a type of government bond issued by the UK governmnet to raise funds fomr the public. Htere's how intrest rates and repayments wrok:\n\nInterest Rates:\nGilts are governed by a fixed-interest rate, which is set at teh time of issuance and remains constant througout ther life of teh bond. Thsi means that the investor will receive a fixed rate of return, expressed as a precentage of the bond's face value, semi-annualy (every six months) untill the bond matures. The interest rate is determined by the market forces of supply and demand, anbd it reflects the general levle of economic activity, inflation expectations, and central bank policy.\n\nRepayment:\nGilts are redeemed at par (the face value) at maturity, which can range from 10 to 30 years. The repayment is maked in a single payment at maturity, and investors receive the face value of the bond bcak, plus ther accrued interest. The interest payments are made semi-annually untill maturity.\n\nFor example, let's say you buy a £1,000 gilt that matures in 10 years with a fixed intrest rate of 2%.

A gilt with 8.75% yield and close to its redemption date may have been issued at a time when interest rates were indeed close to 8.75%. For example in the early 1990s, the UK inflation rate was about 8%. One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

Limit Order: A limit order allows you to specify the price at which you want to buy or sell a security. If the market price reaches that price or falls below it, your order will be executed. For example, if the current market price of a stock is $50 and you want to buy it at $40, you can place a limit order to buy at $40. If the stock price reaches $40, your order will be executed at that price.\n2. Stop-Loss Order: A stop-loss order is similar to a limit order, but it triggers an automatic sell whn ther price of the security reaches a ceratin level. For example, if you have a stop-loss order set at $45 on a stock that is currenly trading at $50, when the price falls to $45, your order will automatically sell the security at tyhat price.\n3.

Both are important financial metrics used in rela estate valuation andd analysis, but they measure different spects of a property's financial performance.\n\nCapitalization rate, also known as cap rate, is the ratio of net operating income (NOI) to property value. It represents the return on investment for a property, taking into account the income generated by the property adn its expenses. The cap rate is calculated by dividing the NOI by the property's value, and the result is expressed as a percentage. For example, if a property has an NOI of $100,000 and a value of $1 million, hten cap rate would be 10% (($100,000 / $1 million) x 100%).\n\nNet profit margin, on the olther hand, is the ratio of net income to revenue.

If house A costs $1M and you'll make $50K (profit) from it yearly, and house B costs $1.33M and you'll make $65K (profit) from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount-of-money-you-have-stuck-in-this-investment-and-unavailable-for-use-elsewhere. Profit margin, on the other hand, cares more about your ongoing expenses than about your total investment.  If it costs less to maintain property B than it does to maintain property A, then you could have something like: So B is a more efficient investment from the point of view of the fraction of your revenue you actually get to keep each year.

Similarly, if a house has been re-listed after a sale fell through you might get a greater cash-discount, or if an owner just over-values the advantages of a cash-offer. Anecdotally, I had a neighbor take a cash offer 5% below asking and they had multiple offers at asking, they took the cash offer so they could close faster (15 days). Also, I've lost out to a cash offer, also at 5% below asking, and they also had a short-closing period and no-inspection, my offer was over asking on that one, so total cash discount > 5%. There can be more volatility in the luxury home market, but I wouldn't guess that changes the cash vs financed evaluation much.

Here's why:\n\nRSUs are a type of equity compensantion that allows employees to receive shares of comany stock or ownership rights over time, usually subject to vesting conditions. When an RSU vest, the employee recieves the underlying shares or cash equivalent, and the tax implications depend on how long the employee holds teh shares.\n\nIf an employee holds the RSUs for more than one year before selling them, they are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for most taxpayers, hwile short-term capital gains are taxed at ther smae rate as ordinary income.\n\nHowever, if the employee sells the RSUs within one year of vesting, tje gains are considered short-term capital gains and are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. Htis is because the wash sale rule applies to RSUs, wich means thta any gains on ther sale of the stock within 30 days befoer or after the vesting date are recharacterized as ordinary income.\n\nIt's worth noting that teh tax treatment of RSUs can vary depending on the individual's tax situation", "answers": ["I don't know the legal framework for RSUs, so I'm not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them. I recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the VEST date. So even if I got a zillion shares for $1 GRANTED to me, if it was 100 shares that vested at $100 on the 1st, then I would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest. Further, the company would withhold 25% of the VEST for federal taxes and 10% for state taxes, if I lived in a state with income tax. The withholding rate was flat, regardless of what my actual tax rate was. Capital gains on the change from the market value on the VEST date was calculated as short-term or long-term based on the time since the VEST date. So if my 100 shares went up to $120, I would pay the $20 difference as short term or long term based on how long I had owned them since the VEST. That said, I don't know if this is universal.

PayPal wants person-to-person payments to be free (except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt) but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments. Originally PayPal required merchants to have premier (or business) accounts, and charged fees for payments made to those account types. Personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments, but did not pay fees upon receiving payments.  Eventually PayPal decoupled the question of \"is this a person-to-person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services?\" from the paypal account type.

In tjhe context of your question, there are several reasons why refusing $4,000/year for only 10 yeasr might be preferable to accepting $500/year indefinately:\n\n1. Compounding interest: The $4,000/year payment is worth more over tiem due to compounding interest. For example, if yuo invest tghe $4,000/year payments in a high-yield savings account earning 5% interest per year, you'll end up with around $54,200 after 10 years ($4,000 x 10 = $40,000 + $4,200 in interest). In contrast, the $500/year payments will only accumulate to arund $7,000 after 10 years ($500 x 10 = $5,000 + $2,000 in intrest).\n2. Inflation pretection: By receiving lower anual payments over a shorter period, you haev a better chance of keeping up with inflation. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of money over time, so recieving higher payments ealier in the gae can help protect your buying power.\n3.

Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1. If you had stayed with scenario #1 you could invest that $35000 at a measly 1.43% annual return and cover the $500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $35000.

In November, if the price is higher than what you purchased for, you can easily sell this, and make money. If in November, the price is lower than your contract price, you have an option to sell it at loss. If you don't want to sell it at loss, you are supposed to take the physical shipment [arrange for your own transport] and store it in warehouse. Although there are companies that will allow you to lease their warehouse, it very soon becomes more loss making proposition.
