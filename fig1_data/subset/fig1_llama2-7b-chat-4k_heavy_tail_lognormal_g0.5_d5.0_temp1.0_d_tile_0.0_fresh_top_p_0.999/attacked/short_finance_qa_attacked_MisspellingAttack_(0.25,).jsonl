Thge ideal credit utilization rate is typically considered to be below 30%, although some sources may suggest a range of 10% to 20%.\n\nWhen you use a large porshan of your available credit, your credit utilization rate increases.

It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use.

A good wealth manager: In short, they can save you time and money and help you take the most advantage of your current savings. Or, you can think about it in terms of cost. Most wealth managers charge an annual fee (as a % of the amount invested) for their services. This fee can range anywhere from close to zero, to 0.75% depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in, and what kind of additional services they have to offer. Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio? Large successful funds like Renaissance Technologies and Citadel can charge 3% in addition to 30% of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market.

Percentage companies are usually sole proprietorship and partnerships, but partnerships can now trade in \"units\".  Share companies are usually corporations. With shares, a company can be divided into almost totally indistinguishable units.  This allows for more flexible ownership, so individuals can trade them without having to change the company contract. Considering the ease of trade, it could be assumed that common stock contract provisions were formulated to provide for such an ease. Motivation to trade This could be anything, but it seems those with the largest ownership of common stock have lots of wealth, so it could be assumed that people at least want to own stocks to own wealth. Shorting might be a little harder to reason, but I personally assume that the motivation to trade is still to increase wealth.

The cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings. Bear in mind that we are talking pennies here. I don't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to. Say it's $3,000. I think that would be a lot for most people. You say you're getting 3.6% on your savings. So if, on the average, you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have, you're getting an extra 2 / 52 x 3.6% x $3,000 in interest, or $4 per month. I think the last time I paid a late fee on a credit card it was $35, so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings.

It works by setting a minumum price at whic an investment can be sold, above whic the investor will incur a loss. By using a stop-loss order, investors can guard againnst siginificant losses in thier portfolio due to market volatility or unforeseen events.\n\nThe safety of using stop-losses depends on several factors, including the type of investment, the investor's risk tolerence, and the market conditions. In general, stpo-losses can be a useful tool in managing risk, but tehy are nto foolproof. Htere are some potential risks to concider:\n\n1. Price fluctuations: The price of an investment may fall below the stpo-loss levle due to market fluctuations, even if thge underlying fundamentals of hten investment are strong. In such cases, the stpo-loss order may be triggered, resulting in a loss.\n2. Market volatility: In highly volatile markets, stop-loss orders may be triguered more frequently, leading to excessive trading activity and potential losses.\n3. Gapping: In some cases, thge price of an investment may gap below the stpo-loss levle, resulting in a larger loss than anticipated.\n4. Market events: Unforeseen market events", "answers": ["A stop-loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order. This means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price. For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses. For securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop-limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market, but you may end up stuck with shares you don't want for longer than originally planned.

How does it work?[/INST]", "pred": " Yes, anohter tax loss can be used to offset capital gains taxes through a proces called \"tax loss harvesting.\" Tax loss harvesting involves selling an investment that has declined in value to realize a loss, whihc can be used to offset capital gains frome the sale of another investment. By doing so, you can reduce your tax liability on the capital gains from the second investment.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Identify investments that have declined in value: Review your investment portfolio to identify investments that have lost value compared to thier originall purchase price. These investments are called \"tax loss positions.\"\n2. Sell the tax loss positions: Sell the investments that are in tax loss positions to realize ther losses. You can sell them through a broker or directly thru the financial institution where you hold them.\n3. Use the losses to offset capital gains: Once you have relized the losses, you can use them to offset capital gains frome other investments. For example, if you sold an investment for a gain of $1,000, you could use a $500 loss fomr another investment to reduce your tax liability by $500.\n4.

An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss. A sale of any asset held for over a year to your day, and sold at a loss, will create a loss that is long-term. When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040. Example Frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year: Short-term gains - $6,000 Long-term gains - $4,000 Short-term losses - $2,000 Long-term losses - $5,000 Net short-term gain/loss - $4,000 ST gain ($6,000 ST gain - $2,000 ST loss) Net long-term gain/loss - $1,000 LT loss ($4,000 LT gain - $5,000 LT loss) Final net gain/loss - $3,000 short-term gain ($4,000 ST gain - $1,000 LT loss)   Again, Frank can only deduct $3,000 of final net short- or long-term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 305.0}
