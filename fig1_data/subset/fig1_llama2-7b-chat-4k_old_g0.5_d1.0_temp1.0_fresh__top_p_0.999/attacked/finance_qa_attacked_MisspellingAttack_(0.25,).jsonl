If you have a poor credit history, your score may be lower, which can impact your abilty to qualify for a loan. However, if you've made efforts to improve your credit score since the divorce, you may have a better chance of qualifying.\n2. Debt-to-Income Ratio: Lenders typically consider your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio when evaluating loan applications. Tihs ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your income. If ytou have a high DTI ratio due to outstanding debts from the divorce, it may be more difficult to qualify for a loan. However, if you haev sicne paid off some of those debts or reduced your monthly payments, you may be in a better position.\n3.

Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

Your credit score is a threee-digit number thgat lenders use to evaluate the likelyhood of yuo repaying a loan or credit debt on tiem. A higher credit score indicates a lower risk, while a lower score indicates a higher risk.\n\nCredit utilization is hten percentage of available credit that you're using. It plays a significant role in determining your credit score. When you use a small percentage of your available credit, it can positively affect your credit score. This is because it shows you can manage your credit responsibly and maintain a good credit utilization ratio.\n\nThe ideal credit utilization ratio varies depending on hten credit scoring modle used by lenders. However, generaly, using less than 30% of your avaliable credit can help you maintain a good credit score. Useing more tahn 30%, on the other hand, can negatively affect your score. This is because it suggests you're over-extending yourself adn may struggle to repay your debts.\n\nHere's how credit utilization impacts your credit score:\n\n1.

Good credit utilization: Using less than 30% of your available credit can help you maintain a good credit score", "answers": ["Curious, why are you interested in building/improving your credit score? Is it better to use your card and pay off the bill completely every month? Yes. How is credit utiltization calculated?    Is it average utilization over the month, or total amount owed/credit_limit per month? It depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies. It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends.

Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio? Large successful funds like Renaissance Technologies and Citadel can charge 3% in addition to 30% of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market.

When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses.

The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%!

A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.  There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity (number of shares) that the bond can be converted into.  If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.

This means that even if tjhe underlying securities in the ETF's portfolio have nto changed, the ETF itself may need to sell soem securities and buy others to rebalance its portfolio. As a result, tje ETF's perfomance may deviate from the performance of its underlying holdings.\n2. Transaction costs: ETFs incur transaction costs whn buying or selling securities. These costs can include brokerage commisions, slippage (the difference between the ETF's bid price adn tjhe price it receives), and other expenses. Theese costs can affect the ETF's performance, potentially causing it to underperform its holdings.\n3. Creations anbd redemptions: ETFs issue andd redeem shares to create and redeem units to institutional investors, known as authorized participants (APs).

When APs sense   demand for additional shares of an ETF—which manifests itself when the   ETF share price trades at a premium to its NAV—they go into the market   and create new shares. When the APs sense demand from investors   looking to redeem—which manifests itself when the ETF share price   trades at a discount—they process redemptions.

The AP can buy the underlying securities for $20/share in a bulk order that equates to 50,000 shares of the ETF and exchange the underlying shares for new shares in the ETF.

The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back?

Wehn you buy a Gilts, you are essentialy lending money to the government for a fixed preiod of time, in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of your principal investment at maturity.\n\nThe intrest rates on Gilts are set by the Government at the time of issue and are determined by hten market forces of suppy and demand.

One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

Similarly, if a house has been re-listed after a sale fell through you might get a greater cash-discount, or if an owner just over-values the advantages of a cash-offer. Anecdotally, I had a neighbor take a cash offer 5% below asking and they had multiple offers at asking, they took the cash offer so they could close faster (15 days). Also, I've lost out to a cash offer, also at 5% below asking, and they also had a short-closing period and no-inspection, my offer was over asking on that one, so total cash discount > 5%. There can be more volatility in the luxury home market, but I wouldn't guess that changes the cash vs financed evaluation much.

Whatever options you find, they'll charge pretty steep interest rates and have high payments because they'll keep you on as short a payment term as your finances will allow.  I would strongly suggest that you work on improving your score for awhile before trying to buy a car.  If you can, buy a car for cash.  You might not get much, but it will solve your transportation problem while you work on resolving your credit issues. Using a credit counselor won't have any impact on your credit score as far as the debts are concerned.  What will make a difference is not having them show as open collections, which is pretty bad.

The gist of all this is that the seller of the vehicle mentioned does not have clear title if there is a lien.  This introduces a risk for the buyer.  The buyer can pay the seller the money to cover the lien (in the case of a bank loan) but that doesn't mean the seller will actually pay off the loan (so the title is never clear!).

Both the government and state governments have laws anbd regulations in palce to handle taxes on artwork sales.

Tje rules regarding sales tax vary by state, so it's important to research the laws in thge state where you live and the state where the artwork will be sold. In most states, sales tax is charged whn the sale tkaes palce, and the seller is responsible for collecting and remitting the tax to the state. Some states, however, may require the buyer to pay the sales tax directly to the seller, who then remits it to the state.\n2. Income Tax: Income tax is charged on tghe profit made from the sale of artwork. As a artist, ytou may be considered self-employed and recquired to file taxes quarterly based on your artwork sales.

It looks like Etsy uses a different model where you yourself are responsible for the sales tax, which requires you to register with your state (looks like this is the information for New York) and pay the taxes yourself on a regular basis; see this link for a simple guide. If you're doing this, you'll need to keep track of how much tax you owe from your sales each month, quarter, or year (depending on the state laws).  You can usually be a sole proprietor, which is the easiest business structure to set up; if you want to limit your legal liability, or work with a partner, you may want to look into other forms of business structure, but for most craftspeople a sole proprietorship is fine to start out with.

Now, what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock? They sell it, supply goes up, demand goes down, and the price drops. The company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way; directly via the offer, or on the open market. This is, however, usually not successful beyond the very short term, and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the 800-pound gorilla, which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets. Such offers are also very closely watched by the SEC; if there's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner, or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves, the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of SEC and DoJ legal proceedings."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 255.0}

Htere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Risk assessment: Credit ratings are based on a throrough evaluation of an entity's financial stability, debt burden, and abilty to meet its finacial obligations. The rating agencies analyze a range of factors, including financial statements, cash flows, and market conditions.\n2.

A higher credit rating indicates a lower risk of default, which can lead to higher investment returns. Conversely, a lower credit rating implies a higher level of risk, which may deter investors.\n3. Borrowing costs: For companies and governments, credit ratings can affect borrowing costs. A higer rating can result in lower interest rates on loans and bonds, while a lower rating may lead to higher interest costs.\n4.

While few investments are guaranteed and likely none in your retirement account,  money-market funds are likely the choice you have with the least fluctuation and similar minimal risk to short term treasuries. However, a second important risk to consider is inflation.  Money market funds generally have returns similar or less than the inflation rate.  While money markets funds help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market the value of your retirement account falls behind the cost of goods over time.

PayPal wants person-to-person payments to be free (except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt) but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments. Originally PayPal required merchants to have premier (or business) accounts, and charged fees for payments made to those account types. Personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments, but did not pay fees upon receiving payments.  Eventually PayPal decoupled the question of \"is this a person-to-person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services?\" from the paypal account type.
