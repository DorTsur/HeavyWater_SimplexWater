But, just like how superheroes can have bad days, the Soviet Union had some big problems that led to its collapse.\n\nOne of the biggest problems was that the Soviet Union was really, really big. It was so big that it was hard for the government to take care of everything. There were lots of different ethnic groups and languages, and it was hard to make everyone happy. It was like trying to feed and take care of a really big family, but with a lot more problems.\n\nAnother problem was that the Soviet Union was really bad at having nice things. The people didn't have many nice things like food, cars, or computers. They didn't have enough money to buy these things, and the government couldn't help because it was too busy trying to keep everything together.\n\nAlso, the Soviet Union was ruled by a group of old men who didn't listen to the people. They made all the big decisions without asking the people what they wanted. It was like they were playing a game of \"Soviet Union Bingo\" and they didn't want to give the people any chance to play.\n\nSo, after many, many years of having big problems, the Soviet Union finally collapsed.

There 's the collapse of the \" sattelites \" ( nations under the Soviet umbrella like East Germany , Poland or the Ukraine ) and of the Kremlin itself . Because the Soviets saw themselves as a global ideology , ie , workers everywhere will rise up and overthrow their capitalist masters , the fall and reversion of sattelites and communist allies weakened their image , which , coupled with crippling economic issues back home , lead to their collapse . Let 's break down the factors : 1 . * * External Issues * * : A : The US and its allies were doing everything they could to defy the \" spread of communism \" . This often meant funding local political competitors or even directly intervening ( Korea , Vietnam ) . This could mean anything from shipping arms to Greece , bribing politicians in Italy to team up ( which most people do n't know threatened to go communist ) , to even aligning themselves with former fascists ! As long as you were n't communist , you could be a total tyrant and we would support you against the Reds . The CIA even handed out orange scarves and signs in Ukraine because the opposition \" solidarity \" party had orange as its color ! B. China , once an ideological ally of the Soviets , broke away because they were afraid of Soviet influence . They had their own brand of \" communism \" that I wo n't get into because it could fill 10 threads but basically they broke what was a very intimidating alliance . C. Globalization ( and this is somewhat internal as well ) lead to a lot of discontent . This , coupled with what you 've probably heard called * perestroika * , which was actually an attempt by the Soviet Union to modernize itself and fix its ailing economy ( addressed later ) is often cited as THE # 1 reason for the fall of the Soviet Union . Basically , you get an open media ( glasnost ) that starts telling the truth about people disappearing and about the quality of life outside of the Soviet Union versus in it and this leads to a lot of people saying \" hey wait , the capitalist workers have it better ! \" 2 . * * Internal Issues * * A. No computers ! One thing it 's important to remember is that the Kremlin was the biggest , most convoluted , wasteful bureaucracy in the history of the world . It tried to set the prices for everything , rather than letting market demand handle that . This lead to a lot of crazy redundancies like it being cheaper to take a cab from Moscow to St. Petersburg than it would be to take a train or a plane . Imagine all the paperwork that would require ! Now imagine , on top of this huge bureaucracy , you have an entire nation like Poland , a huge chunk of land and industry , up and leave the Union . Imagine what it would be like to try to micromanage every tremor that would send through your market , * on paper * . Nearly impossible ! B. Corruption . You can imagine that in a country where there 's only 1 political party , any competitors are killed , declared insane , sent to itnernment camps , or some combination of those things , that this \" vanguard party \" is going to command a lot of power . And , as usual , power corrupts . Especially when you can control every single flow of goods and resources . The Soviet system actually ended up being incredibly unfair ! You can imagine that people did n't like that , and that it lead to a lot of waste . For all that , the Soviet Union did n't just explode one day . People call it a collapse because the Soviet Sattelites seemed to turn capitalist and leave the union in the blink of an eye ( because after one went , others were emboldened , and because the Soviet presence was weaker , so it was mostly local communist sympathizers with some Soviet support versus local nationalist / royalist / fascist / capitalist / christian sympathizers with the West 's support ) , but the Vanguard Party itself actually surrendered itself ( to the Russians ) very slowly via internal market reform and democratization . So to answer your last question , is it possible that the US could lose its satellites that we do n't have , and then become more fair and democratic , I would say \" I certainly hope so ! \" -edit Disclaimer : not that the Russians are super fair and democratic now .", "MA International Relations here . The cause of the break up of the Soviet Union : * * External Issues :* * Not enough / poor quality vodka * * Internal Issues :* * Too much vodka .", "Of course it 's possible that the US could fail , but different countries fail in different ways , so it 's unlikely the US would fall in the same way ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 342.0}

Let's talk about music! 🎶\n\nYou know how we can hear different sounds when we listen to different things, like a cat meowing or a dog barking? Well, in music, different instruments can make different sounds too! 🎵\n\nAn instrument is like a toy that musicians play to make music. Each instrument has its own special sound, like a piano has a really loud, bright sound, and a flute has a really nice, soft sound. 🎹🎶\n\nBut how do we know which instrument is making which sound? That's where frequency comes in! 🕰️\n\nFrequency is like a special kind of magic number that tells us how fast or slow an instrument is playing. It's like a secret code that only musicians and instruments can understand. 🤔\n\nFor example, a piano has really high frequency sounds, like when you play an A note. That means the piano is playing super fast! On the other hand, a cello has really low frequency sounds, like when you play the same A note. That means the cello is playing super slow! 😍\n\nSo, when you hear an A note on a cello and an A note on a piano, you know the cello is playing way slower than the piano", "completions_tokens":

An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .", "Two main things differentiate different sounds that have the same frequency . One is the \" shape \" of the sound . In nature , the shape of the frequency is likely to be a sine - wave . On a graph it would be a snake - like shape . Electronically generated sounds can have different shapes , like a square - wave , sawtooth - wave , or whatever . Second is the overtones . Suppose the frequency is middle C , at 262 beats per second . One instrument might have a strong overtone at the next C up , with a frequency of 524 beats per second . Another instrument might have hardly any sound there , but a strong overtone at the next C above that . We hear the lowest frequency as the note , and we hear the shape and the overtone as information about the kind of instrument that created that note .", "Three main things : * Timbre ( Which overtones - I 'll explain what those are soon - are most present in the sound ) * Envelope . This describes the amplitude shape of the sound - how hard is the attack , how long does the attack stay that way , how long does the sound last , and how quickly does the sound decay ? In a synthesizer , you can control all of these components through something called ADSR ( Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release ) . * Additional Noise ( The sound of the guitar amp hum , the squeak of a piano pedal , the rosin of the bow on the violin string , etc ) Now , Timbre . Notes are made of vibrations . Imagine a vibrating string . That string vibrates along its entire length , but it also vibrates along divisions of that length . The smaller the divisions , the higher the notes . This means that inside of every note you hear are several , fainter , higher notes . These are called partials , overtones , or harmonics . An instrument 's timbre is decided largely by the * balance * of those overtones . A flute , for example , has a very pure overtone expression with mostly lower , consonant ( meaning , for ELI5 purposes , \" pleasant \" ) partials . This gives it a clear sound . A distorted electric guitar , by contrast , has a lot of presence in its higher partials , which gives it more of a jagged quality . This is an over - simplified version , but all you need to know is that the overtone pattern determines much of the quality of the sound . You can actually hear the overtone series in your own voice , because each vowel brings out a different overtone . Sing a medium - low note in your range , clearly , and switch slowly between \" ooh \" and \" ee \" - you should hear , faintly , a note above the note you 're singing that suddenly gets higher and louder when you sing the \" ee \" . If you get good enough at this , you can do what [ this weird awesome lady ] ( URL_0 ) does and sing two notes at the same time . The same thing that makes two of your vowels sound different - even though they 're almost identical sounds coming from the same voice - is what makes two instruments sound different : overtones . But what happens if two instruments have similar overtone profiles ? A trumpet and an oboe , for example , have almost identical timbres . Here we want to look at our envelope , particularly our attack . A trumpet has a very crisp , biting attack that 's very fast , while an oboe has a much more mellow attack . If we jump into the middle of an oboe or trumpet note , it 's hard to hear the difference - but that initial attack & sputter in the trumpet makes the difference very clear ! The vocal equivalent of this would be consonants . Finally , noise . In addition to the overtone series and the envelope , there are all sorts of noises that go along with a sound that we may not consider as musical but are nonetheless important . The sound of additional air coming through a trumpet , the rattle in somebody 's voice when they sing a note too early in the morning , the buzz of a guitar amplifier . Our ear takes all of these clues , puts them together , and - voila ! - you 've perceived not just what the note is , but what kind of instrument is making the note !"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 341.6666666666667}

Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Wow, you want to know about a really important book called \"The Catcher in the Rye\" and why it's so controversial? And why it's connected to John Lennon's death? Let me tell you everything in a way that's easy to understand, just like a big brother or sister would explain something to a curious little kid like you! 😊\n\nSo, \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a book that lots of grown-ups and teenagers like to read because it's all about a boy named Holden Caulfield who has big feelings and thoughts inside his brain. He's kind of like a superhero who's trying to figure out the world and what's right and wrong. But the thing is, the world can be really messy and confusing, and Holden doesn't always know how to handle it. 🤔\n\nThat's why the book is considered controversial! Some people think it's too real and raw, and they don't like how Holden talks about stuff like sex and death. They might say it's not appropriate for kids to read or talk about. But other people think it's actually really important to read about these tough topics, because they help us understand how we feel and how we can be kind to each other. 🤝", "completions_tokens":

of the two . This is because of chemicals called hormones that your body makes to help you grow up . The book \" Catcher in the Rye \" is all about growing up . Its main character , also called a \" protagonist \" , is a teenage boy who is experiencing the full effect of hormones . As a result , he is angry at a lot of people , and sad with the way the world is . He runs away from home after being kicked out from his school for not doing well . After this , he travels around America and has some adventures , although most of these are not good adventures , but bad things that people should not do , like stealing and lying , and doing bad things with girls . He also says a lot of bad words . This has made some people think that the book is bad for people to read it , as it might teach them to do bad things , or use a lot of bad words . The main character also talks about a fantasy he has where he protects children from growing up . Some people think this is bad , as teenagers who are feeling the effects of hormones might be influenced to try not to grow up , rebelling against growing up as a person . Another thing that makes people talks a lot about the book is that the people who try to ban it to protect children from it are acting like the main character in his fantasy to protect children . One thing that has made people really be worried about people reading the book is the fact that it has influenced several people who have then tried to , or actually killed other people . One of these was John Lennon , a famous musician ; the man who shot him had the book with him when he did it , and called it his statement . Some people think the book made him do it , but other people think he was sick in the head and he just thought the book was influencing him .", "it 's a pretty tame book . It was \" banned \" and such before Lennon 's assassination . According to Wikipedia : > The challenges generally begin with Holden 's frequent use of vulgar language[32],[33 ] with other reasons including sexual references,[34 ] blasphemy , undermining of family values[33 ] and moral codes,[35 ] Holden 's being a poor role model,[36 ] encouragement of rebellion,[37 ] and promotion of drinking , smoking , lying , and promiscuity . I should note that these instances * really are n't that bad * . Holden does n't exactly munch clit or anything . He hires a prostitute and chickens out ( I think he tried to have a conversation with her instead ... her pimp punches him out ) . He flirts with some girls . There 's really not much more sexual content than that . I 'm thinking it was pretty much a shocking thing for mid - century readers for a book to be first - person narrated by an adolescent so * honestly * . It kinda freaked people out that there was a book that frankly discussed a teenager 's sexuality and thoughts towards life . That 's just a guess though . There 's also a lot of controversy regarding the merit of the novel . It 's probably the most hated of the \" classics \" . The main criticism is that Holden is unlikable and \" does n't do anything \" . I 'm of the opinion that that 's kinda the point . He is n't supposed to be an Indiana Jones or anything . It 's a coming - of - age novel , and one of the best . He starts out immature , and ends slightly less immature . People have the expectation that it 's going to be more like ... Trainspotting , or something . Go in with the correct expectations .", "Basically , it 's the story of Holden Caulfield . Holden begins the story after being kicked out of Pencey Prep , an elite boarding school , as he is flunking his classes . He proceeds to go to New York City , ask a taxi driver about where ducks go , get rejected , try to pick up older women , get rejected , try to get a hooker , get rejected , until finally meeting with his sister Phoebe , pretty much the only person in the world he can talk to since his brother died of leukemia and his other brother became a sellout . It was considered controversial at the time due to Holden 's coarse language , blunt sexual urges , and anarchist / nihilistic ideals . As for John Lennon 's death , it happens that it was the book that Mark David Chapman , the assassin , was reading at the time of his arrest ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 335.3333333333333}

Make two particles, like tiny balls, but with a special trick up their sleeves! *twinkle* These particles can be exactly the same, or different, but they're always connected in a very special way.\n2. Give them a spin! *spin* Scientists use different ways to make these particles spin, like putting them in a machine or using special light to make them spin around really fast.\n3. Watch out! *voiceover* When these particles spin around really fast, they start to behave like they're stuck together, no matter how far apart they are! *engine noise* This is quantum entanglement

With that said , let 's start off by saying that two particles are considered entangled when their correlations satisfy Bell inequalities . This does n't answer how to explain it without knowing what correlations or bell inequalities are , but it 's the technical working definition . Picture two light particles separated by a very large distance , and measure their polarizations . If they 're so far apart that light could not have gone between the two of them in the time it took you to measure their polarization , AND their is a relationship between the two polarizations , then they are entangled . So we know how to tell if they 're entangled . So how do we actually entangle them ? One way is through quantum interference . In quantum mechanics , the \" state \" of a particle is represented by a \" wavefunction \" . Unlike an electric wave , there is nothing we know of that is actually waving . It does tell you the probability of measuring a particle or particle properties , though . Since it 's a wave , however , it posses wave properties like interference . If a crest and trough line up , the wave amplitude goes to zero at that point . One experiment where they tested this was the \" Hong - Ou - Mandel \" experiment . They sent two identical photons in two sides of a \" beamsplitter \" ( a device which splits light 50:50 ) and measured how often the two photons came out different sides or the same side . It turns out that the path for photons to come out different sides ( since there 's two ways for that to happen ) cancel out , and you only ever see two come out either side . The final state of the system is entangled : the two possible output states are in an equal \" superposition \" . There are other ways of entangling particles , though . Another commonly cited entanglement phenomena is in positronium ( an electron and its antiparticle orbiting each other ) . When the electron and positron ( anti - electron ) annihilate they have a certain probability to emit two photons in opposite directions with unknown but correlated polarizations . That is , when you measure the two photons they will always have polarizations at 90 degrees to each other no matter how far apart they are .", "The simplest example I can think of is by creating two particles that are entangled when they are made . If you 're not familiar with spin , it 's a number that is a measure of angular momentum . You can think of it as just an intrinsic property of particles without actually worrying about what it means . You take a particle(s ) with spin of 0 , then turn it into two particles having spin of , say , 1 . An example might be electron - positron annihilation . If the electron has a spin of +1/2 and the positron has a spin of -1/2 , the total spin of the system is 0 . When they run into each each other they will make two photons . Each photon must have spin of +1 or -1 . There 's a law that says that the total spin of a system must be conserved , the same way energy is conserved . Because the spins have to be 0 , this forces one of the photons to be +1 and the other to be -1 , they ca n't both have the same spin . The thing is , the quantum nature of the photons mean we do n't know which one is which , furthermore , they do n't have a well defined spin until something actually measures it . Say we go in and measure one of the photons . It could be either spin , but let 's say when we measure it as +1 , this forces the second particle to be of spin -1 . If we had measured the first as -1 , the second would be +1 . The key is that neither of these particles had a well defined spin until the moment it was measured , at which point it forced the other to be the opposite direction .", "From what I know there are many different ways to entangle \" particles\"(You got ta be carefull with that term since quantum objects can be seen as wave and particle ) . One possibility to entangle photons is per example the so called ' Spontaneous parametric down - conversion ' , where photons pass through a ( nonlinear ) crystal and have a chance to become two entangled photons with opposite polarisation . Another possibility is one or more objects that emmit two new objects , which are entangled . This can be an p.e . a molecule which gets \" destroyed \" into two atoms which are entangled or a particle and a anti - particle which ' destroy ' each other and emmit two photons . Ca n't think of something else atm ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 335.6666666666667}

["It makes it easier to sustain a chain reaction using normal fuel . Its a neutron moderator , you can use it in heavy water based reactors ( that do not require enriched uranium ) such as the Canadian CANDU . Heavy water moderated reactors running on unenriched uranium could eventually produce enough plutonium for a bomb . You could have used Graphite instead , i think .", "First , they were trying to build a nuclear reactor , not a nuclear bomb . Even those who think they were trying to build a bomb acknowledge this — it is because building large reactors is one of the paths to creating the fuel for a bomb . In a nuclear reactor , you are trying to get uranium-235 atoms to absorb neutrons so that they split , releasing more neutrons . The fuel for a reactor , however , has very little U-235 in it . Unenriched fuel , which is what everyone during WWII was using , has less than 1 % U-235 in it . The rest of the fuel is U-238 , which will not fission easily . So the odds of an individual neutron hitting a U-235 atom are low , and the odds that the neutrons produced by the subsequent fission reaction will find another U-235 atom are also low . This is why you can put as much unenriched uranium in one place as you want and normally nothing will happen . To increase the odds , there are two things you can do . One is to increase the relative quantity of U-235 in the fuel — enrichment . This is how a bomb works , and many reactors today also work this way ( standard civilian power reactor fuel is enriched to 3 - 4 % U-235 , a nuclear bomb is 80 - 90 % U-235 ) . The other is to add what is known as a \" moderator . \" A moderator is a light element that the neutrons created by fission reactions can bounce off of . This bouncing decreases their energy / speed / temperature ( all the same thing at this scale ) . Low - energy neutrons have a higher likelihood of getting absorbed by U-235 atoms than higher - energy neutrons . The reason has to do with the fact that at those sizes , the relationship between the speed of a particle and the size of a particle are inverse ; from the neutron 's perspective , the U-235 atoms get bigger when it slows down . More or less . So if you take unenriched uranium and intersperse it with a good moderator , the atoms from fission will get slowed down , and that increases the chance they 'll find and hit another U-235 atom , and the reaction will continue . The two candidates for moderators that were explored during World War II were graphite ( basically just carbon atoms ) and heavy water . ( Regular water can worked with slightly enriched uranium , but not unenriched uranium ; there are obscure nuclear physics reasons for this . ) In the US , they used graphite . At first they found that graphite did n't work that well . They discovered that this was n't a problem with graphite , per se , but because the methods of producing graphite introduced impurities like boron , which is a neutron absorber . So they worked with the graphite producers to make extremely pure graphite , which worked very well . The US also built several heavy water plants , in case the graphite did n't work out . They did produce a heavy water reactor ( CP-3 ) that went online in 1944 , but their main reactors used graphite . In Germany , they explored graphite but also found it did n't work well . They did n't realize this was because of impurities . So they pursued only the heavy water route , because they had heavy water production facilities under their control . However , they never acquired enough heavy water to actually make a nuclear reactor ( and this is unrelated to the sabotage of the heavy water plant by the Allies , as an aside ) , and even if they had acquired enough , it would have , at most , allowed them to make a small , experimental nuclear reactor , not generate enough plutonium to make a nuclear bomb . The notion that the Germans were close to getting a bomb is a complete myth — they were very far from it by the end of the war . So , to conclude : heavy water was chosen as a moderator for the German reactor experiments . [ Here is a graphic ] ( URL_0 ) which compares US and German heavy water stockpiles , and even if is a little misleading because a lot of the German heavy water was diluted . CP-3 is shown to give you an idea of how much heavy water you need for a small nuclear reactor . To make a bomb , you need much larger reactors than that .", "Their original plan was not to build an atomic weapon , but an nuclear reactor .

You and your friends all bring out a box of toy soldiers and a few toy houses . The rules of this game is that you get to make a base out of your houses , and you get to order your toy soldiers around the battlefield . If a soldier dies , he is removed , but after a little while you can make him again at one of the little houses . You want to destroy everybody else 's base with your army . If you lose a house , after a little while you get to put another house in your base . After a while you get bored of this game , and decide to come up with another game . You already have all your little soldiers and houses and stuff , but you want different rules . So you and your friends bring two adults over , probably two daddies because they 're nerdy enough to help out . You tell the daddies : you get to order the toy soldiers , but they 're not very smart so just attack the enemy base and whoever is closest to you ! And you and your buddies each pull out your own special action figure . You 've pulled out Duke Nukem , but Carl pulled out Simba and Alan pulled out GI Joe . Duke Nukem can do awesome things , but Simba and GI Joe can also do awesome things , only they 're different awesome things . Everybody is on a team , being with one or the other daddy 's team , and you try to destroy the other base , defending your base and killing their heroes if you need to . If your hero gets killed , you have to sit out for a while before you can play again . Pretend War is Warcraft 3 , the other game is DotA.", "Warcraft 3 is like you being a general of an army in a war game . Deciding what resources you need to win you the war , hence what structures to build and what type of soldiers you hire . You control EVERYTHING . And at the start of war , you have no idea where the enemy base it . DotA is like you being a Commando ( hero ) , an elite soldier if you will . You know where the enemy base is , but you need to buy better equipment while you level up to help you destroy the enemy . You do n't have control over normal soldiers ( although sometimes you 'll have skills to employ some to help you out ) . Your job is to level up your skills and accumulate money through accumulating enemy soldier kills and/or enemy Commando kills . When you have enough firepower , your objective is to destroy enemy defenses and bring down the enemy base . DotA is all about micro managing one special hero unit . There are many combinations of items . Throw in dozens of different heroes , each with 4 unique skills . Games of 5v5 will most likely never be the same from one another .", "Imagine there 's a giant roster of everyone who ever plays basketball , and you really enjoy playing basketball . Every time you get into a new basketball game , you 're randomly paired up with any of those people who are as good as you . The only issue is that 50 % of the people who play the game are deaf , mute , in wheelchairs , and generally do n't care if they lose the game . You have to rely on them to make every shot , as a team , and it 's very hard to get deafmutes to line up the shot . You get very frustrated , but you ca n't blame them , it 's no fault of their own they play this way . After one game , you become very upset with a handicapped player . You blame them for the game loss , telling everyone on the court how bad he is . Driving home you are sad you acted like that , but figure you lost your cool once , and it 's bound to happen to anyone . The next day you 're playing and you 've scored every basket on your team , and yet one of the handicapped players is yelling at you . Yelling to the court how much of a \" faggot noob \" you are . He begins to intentionally let the opposing team score . You have n't had a win in weeks now , and this one human being , full of irrationality and hatred has prevented you from what you so yearn for . You snap . Vision blinded by a blood red hue , you ca n't stop yourself from running train on his sorry paraplegic ass . You try to stand but slip .

But, sometimes it works better than others, and that's okay! *exaggerated smile* It's like a game of \"Sleeping Medication Lottery\"! *makes puzzled face*\n\nYou might be wondering, why can't I win the lottery every time? *chuckles* Well, the thing is, sometimes your body doesn't feel as tired as other times, and that's totally normal. It's like how some days you might feel extra hungry, and other days you don't feel like eating so much. Your body just needs some time to know how much sleeping medication it likes! *eye-roll*\n\nAlso, just like how you need different foods to make you feel different things, like a cookie might make you

I ca n't give you an exact reason because I think there are multiple reasons it is or hit or miss . But if you wanted some anecdotal evidence on what increases my chances for it working : 1 ) Empty stomach for sure . I try to not eat about 2 - 3 hours before I plan on taking it . This means your stomach is emptying from its last meal , but you wo n't be starving either . 2 ) I drop mine in a small amount of water and let it dissolve first . I then rinse the glass and drink that to get any residual drug on the glass . 3 ) Anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes before , I take an antacid / H2 blocker combo like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . Someone with a little more education on this may correct me but my reasoning for this was because some drugs are more absorbed in the stomach and some are better absorbed in the small intestine . I believe that Ambian is better absorbed in the small intestine . ( This is why giving it with food would be a bad idea as that means your stomach is going to hold on to the food until it is broken down and then it will begin to be released to the small intestine . So the drug is just sitting there in your stomach instead of being absorbed . ) Right , so the reason I think Ambian is absorbed in the small intestine is because if you look at the drug name , it 's called zolpidem tartrate . Again , not certain , but I believe the purpose of the tartrate is to \" soak - up \" protons so that the environment is a little more basic , Leaving the drug in its uncharged form , which is the form it needs to be in order to be absorbed . So , if you are like me , and have constant heartburn anyway , it seems to help with absorption . Also , the antacid I linked has famotidine in it . There is an analogue of this drug called cimetidine , which is known to have drug interactions in the liver . For Ambian , there is some evidence of a slight interaction with cimetidine although I ca n't find the paper right now . If I remember correctly , this just means that your liver would take longer to break down Ambian , thereby prolonging it 's effect . Which would n't be so great if you had to be up early . Normally , Ambian clears from your system rather quickly . This is n't medical advice . This is just what I do and why I do it . Hope it helps ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 345.6666666666667}

but you only have rubber stamps of circles . How do you do draw a square ? You can use the biggest circle stamp , call it \" size 10 \" , to make one big circle , then stamp a smaller \" size 5 \" circle four times around the big circle , then use progressively smaller circle stamps to fill in the gaps until you have a solid square . As you can imagine you 'd be using the smallest circle stamp ( \" size 1 \" ) a lot to fill in the small white spaces at the sharp corners of the square . Now suppose you needed a shorthand notation to describe this to another stamp artist how you drew a square using only circle stamps : 1 square = 1 size10 + 4 size5 + 16 size3 + 86 size2 + 158 size1 Why is this useful ? In the world of electronics and signals it 's almost as if you 're trying to communicate information using only one type of rubber stamp : the sine wave . The Fourier Series allows you to express and communicate arbitrary information using the the rubber circle stamp of the electronics world : the sine wave . Added bonus , once information is translated into a sum of sine waves it can be transmitted , stored , and processed very easily . In fact you can use this for compression . Suppose you do n't need to draw a perfect square , an approximate square would be good enough . Then you can transmit less information : 1 square = 1 size10 + 4 size5 + 16 size3 It 's a lumpy square but good enough . This is basis for JPEG and MPG signal compression : it translates the data into a wave , expresses that wave an approximate sum of sine waves , some of the fine detail information is lost , the information about how to reconstruct the signal is what is stored and transmitted , but overall our eyes and ears do n't notice that fine detail that was lost .", "This may be LI4 , but : Say you want to make 11 , but you only have a 4s and 1s . You would take two 4s and three 1s and add them together , right . Now say you have a crazy function ( curvy line on a graph ) , that 's your \" 11 \" . It turns out that you can take a bunch of sine and cosine functions ( these are your 4s and 1s ) , and add them together just like we did with the 4s and 1s to get your curvy line . A little more complex : constructing a given function ( your curvy line ) takes a precise combination of the right sine and cosine functions . And just like we took * * two * * 4s and * * three * * 1s , we add those sines and cosines with different * weights * or * coefficients * . Say the given function is more like sin(x ) than cos(x ) , we will add a large sin(x ) to a small cos(x ) .", "LI12 Version : A Fourier Series is a way to break down a periodic shape as a sum of more basic components . Think of some random periodic function as a cookie . It 's really made up of ingredients like flour , butter , sugar , etc . You could write an equation like cookies = # cups x flour + # tbsps x butter + # cups x sugar + ..... for all the ingredients . For any periodic ( endlessly repeating ) function , we can break it up into the most bare bones periodic functions , which are sines and cosines . These look just like waves in a pool or on a string . The equation looks like COMPLEX SHAPE = # x cosine ( # ) + # x sine ( # ) + # x cosine(2 x # ) + ..... The # just stands for some number that is n't important . The important part is that by adding together these very simple functions ( cosine and sine are the simplest possible periodic functions ) , any function can be recreated . The more terms that are used , the better the approximation . In the same fashion of decomposing into fundamental building blocks , a fourier transform takes some complex signal and rewrites it in terms of the frequencies that make it up . Take a complex musical note for example . If you play a chord on a guitar , all you hear is the signal sound generated . But that sound is made up of a number of different strings playing notes at different frequencies all melding together . A transform allows you to go back and forth between thinking about the note as a single complex note or as a number of very simple ones at different frequencies ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 329.3333333333333}

proliferation of firearms creates situations where the police will be a lot less gentle on perbs . This plus the incredibly biased media reporting on the police actions fuels the endless cycle of mutual fear and distrust . The fact that you are asking why the American cops are brutalizing shows just how much the media has influenced you into thinking it is a pandemic thing .", "During the wild sixties and seventies and drug fueled eighties . Police encountered alot of defiance and violence . They adapted their techniques in dealing with the public that minimized their personal space . Over time the perceived threat of police brutality from the communities has evolved into stronger defiance and violence against the police which results in almost military engagement amongst police which many of them are not completely ready for . The police have protocols but many go extreme because of their training combined with adrenaline , fear , defensive instinct and revenge", "I would say that it is pandemic as opposed to being epidemic , that is , it is n't just happening in NYC or Ferguson or Chicago . While the vast majority of police officers in every department are not guilty of brutality or even of looking the other way , it is , and has been , happening in isolated cases across the country . Further , it also seems to be indicative of police deference and entitlement . Little things like officers not following departmental protocols time and time again after reported incidents of the use of extreme force ( e.g. not getting / recording post - incident interviews , failing to collect evidence ) without action taken by the chief or a political system have led to people simply losing faith in the police . Many feel that the entitlement is so rampant that the officers ca n't be trusted as they once were . It goes deeper than this too . There is a very real and deeply seated distrust between non - whites ( and sympathetic / empathetic whites ) and the justice system . Exacerbated by a failed war on drugs and the still tender wounds of the civil rights movement . ( That 's my explanation of the Police side of the issue but , like everything , there are two sides here ) As mentioned above , ours is a generation born of several decades of political strife , or at least our privileged \" first world problems \" version of it . From Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement to Rodney King and Katrina , you could say that protest and civil disobedience is in our blood . This has led to a public refusal to capitulate to authority and , for many , the automatic assumption that those with power are disinterested in the common good or even actively opressive . Law enforcement agencies , as a result , feel they are now in an arms race of sorts . Additional firepower and more agressive tactics have been , they feel , necessitated by a progressively more uncooperative ( and often better armed ) public . This in turn reenforces the public 's notions of opression . ( That is my ELI5 of the situation , the rest is my personal opinion on it ) You will hear often ( in fact a couple comments here reference it ) that these incidents are so infrequent that they hardly deserve attention , the current furor being nothing more than the direct result of news media sensationalization . Worse , you will hear people arguing that Police are people too , they make mistakes and we have to be able to forgive and forget . These ideas are ignorant and ineffectual at best and dishonest and dangerous at worst . We hold our police officers up to be the beacons of justice in this country . Undoubtedly it is a high standard perhaps unachievable but law enforcement is the tool through which we shape a better more idealized society . I firmly believe that we are only ever as righteous as the least righteous amongst us . Police departments have a responsibility to weed out the offending officers . Instead they too often close ranks , look the other way or simply ignore the issue . There is an unfair level of distrust from the public but unfortunately that is not going to change over night . We are many and old grudges die hard , even ill - informed ones . If , however , Law Enforcement decides to take it upon themselves to address the public 's concerns we could arrive at a better level of safety and mutual respect within a couple decades at most . Yes it means being the bigger \" person \" but is n't that exactly what we should expect from our police departments ? TL ; DR Do n't bother getting into the issue if you do n't have time to read eight paragraphs . This is a complicated issue with no room for the lazy and uninformed ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 336.3333333333333}

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, young buddy! *adjusts glasses* So, you want to learn about the trust fund loophole? *grin* Well, let me tell you a tiny story to help you understand. Imagine you have a piggy bank where you save your money. When you want to buy something special, like a toy car or a lollipop, you use the money from your piggy bank to buy it. But, sometimes, you might want to buy something really expensive, like a brand new bike! *excited nod*\n\nThat's where the trust fund loophole comes in. It's like a super-duper piggy bank for big kids and grown-ups. They put their money in this special kind of bank account called a trust fund, and it grows over time. But, the thing is, the money in the trust fund doesn't have to be used right away. It can just sit there, growing bigger and bigger! *imaginary money grows*\n\nNow, the tricky part. Sometimes, grown-ups use the money in their trust fund to pay for things they don't really need, like a new house or a yacht. But, they can also use it to pay for things that are really important, like helping people who are sick or fixing roads that are broken.

insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) . Source : I prepared taxes professionally for five years", "Let 's say you buy stock at $ 10 . You hold it for 20 years , and now it 's worth $ 100 . Normally , when you sell that asset , you pay capital gains taxes on the $ 90 difference in price . Now , you put that stock into a trust and you drop dead before selling it . Your children crack the trust at the $ 100 level . When they sell it , they do n't pay the capital gains tax on the $ 90 profit , as they obtained it at the $ 100 level . Thus , all that income generated from the stock is never taxed at all . As a result , there 's $ 90 per share worth of taxes [ or , more accurately , 20 years of capital gains taxes ] just getting lost .", "When you buy capital assets ( think of things like stocks ) , you have what is called a \" basis \" in that asset . Your basis is usually , with some exceptions , what you paid to purchase the asset . So for example , if you bought a share of stock for $ 100 , your basis in that share of stock is $ 100 . When you sell the stock later , if it is worth more than it was when you bought it , you have \" capital gain . \" The capital gain is the increase in value between your basis and the amount you sold it for . So in this example , lets say that 5 years later , the stock is worth $ 150 . When you sell this stock , you have $ 50 of capital gain . Here is the part that Obama calls the \" Trust Fund Loophole . \" When a person dies , then can give their capital assets to a relative . When they do this , the basis in the assets given is automatically changed to same value as the current value of the asset . So in our example , if the person did n't sell the stock , and instead gave it to their daughter when they died , the daughter now owns the stock and the basis is $ 150 . This is important because it allows the daughter to sell the stock immediately , and pay no capital gains taxes . Had the father sold it before he died , he would have paid capital gains taxes on the $ 50 of capital gains ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 334.6666666666667}

I dispatch for a sheriffs office in a ski county . Our dispatch center dispatches for the county deputies , the state troopers , the park rangers , the wildlife officers , the US forest service officers , and local fire and EMS . As far dispatching law enforcement goes , each agency has a certain jurisdiction , and if a call happens in their jurisdiction we usually send one ( or multiple ) units depending on the call . For example the state troopers take all of the calls on the state roads and interstates ( accidents , traffic violations , road hazards , suspicious vehicles on the interstate , etc ) . The county deputies take all of the calls on county roads , and county property . These calls may include domestic violence calls at a citizens houses , burglary alarms , citizen complains against each other , welfare checks , and civil problems . They also patrol the area proactively trying to prevent crime . They have a job very similar to a city police officer . The park rangers take care of all of the problems in state park jurisdiction , and the wildlife officers generally ride around on ATVS and look for poachers , and take care of the wildlife people encounter on their property . The US forest officer takes the calls in the national forest in our jurisdiction and patrols the highway the passes through it . He may also receive help from our deputies if need be because we have a deputy whose zone passes through his national forest . We also have a local police department in the area , but their dispatch is in another location and we occasionally coordinate . We can hear each others radio traffic , but do n't dispatch each others officers . Now , there are about 6 troopers ( Highway patrol ) on air in the busiest time , and they are separated into 3 zones . Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) . When we take a call our system automatically recognizes the address and maps it for us , and we can see whose zone it is in , and we send that unit . Generally , there is a unit available to assist if they need backup , and all officers in every agency will back each other if they feel they are in a dangerous situation . We have a computer aided dispatch system that tracks all of the calls , and what every unit is doing , so we know if they are available , unavailable , their location and how long they have been on that call so we can security check them if need be . I 'm not going into detail with any other agency besides the highway patrol and Sherrifs deputies because they all pretty much have one zone . I hope this covers at least a small chunk of curiosity . Feel free to ask more questions , because I 'm sure I 've probably made no sense . Oh , and they know the address because it shows up on their mobile dispatch center on their computer in their vehicle , and we always tell them when we dispatch them on the call .", "Depends on the size of the department . Large departments usually have computers in their cars to see what 's pending . They can assign themselves to it or the dispatcher can give them the basics and they look it up on the computer . But there is n't a uniform way things are done for all US agencies , so your local department could easily be very different .", "Short answer : 911 call comes in - > dispatcher takes call and documents information in a call log in the computer - > call goes to a radio - > radio dispatcher goes out over the air to unit using brevity codes ( these codes differ between agencies but tell the officers what type of call it is ) - > officer copies call and responds Address is given to the officer when call is dispatched along with any other important information ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 330.6666666666667}

For reference : URL_0 Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Of course! *giggle* Here's a fun and easy-to-understand explanation of the game of Craps for a curious five-year-old like you! 😊\n\nCraps is a game that grown-ups play in a casino, and it's super fun to watch and learn about! 🤩 First, you need to know that there are two main groups of players in the game: the shooter and the non-shooter. The shooter is the person who throws the dice, and the non-shooter is everyone else who watches and places bets. 🎸\n\nThe goal of the game is simple: you want to roll the dice and get numbers that are close to each other, like 4, 5, or 6! 🤝 When you roll the dice, you get points depending on what number you land on. The more points you get, the more chances you have to win! 😆\n\nNow, here's where it gets exciting! You can place different bets depending on how you think the shooter will do. For example, you can bet that the shooter will get a certain number, like 4 or 5, or that they won't get it. 🤔 You can also bet on things like how many times the shoot", "completions_tokens":

to deal craps . It 's good money . Here is a basic understanding . * * 1 . * * A game is about to start . * * 2 . * * You put money on the pass line . * * 3 . * * The first dice is rolled . * * Three things can happen . * * * You can Win ( Roll a 7 & 11 ) , Lose ( 2,3,12 ) or the game can start ( Any other dice combo : 4,5,6,8,9,10 ) . * * 4 . * * In the event that you do n't auto win or auto lose the game starts . Lets use a ' 6 ' as an example . You rolled a 6 , so the game starts . The big button is placed on the six and it will read ' ON ' * * 5 . * * Now the rules change a bit . * Only * one number can hurt you and it 's a 7 . Every other number can be a winner in some way , especially the 6 . * * 6 . * * 7 is the most common number that can be rolled . In the event that a 7 is rolled again all the money gets wiped off the table . In the event that your number is rolled again ( the 6 ) , everybody wins . * You are basically saying this phrase when you play craps \" I Bet I can roll a number , and I bet I can re - roll that same number , before a 7 , which is the most common number , is rolled . \" * * 7 . * * Now the FUN comes in with all the numbers in between . Lets focus on those big box numbers , 4,5,6,8,9,10 . Lets assume that you 've rolled a 6 . The button is ' ON ' the 6 . The game has been established . Your ultimate goal is to roll a 6 again before you roll a 7 . However , you can put money on the 4,5,8,9 , & 10 . In the event that those numbers come up during a roll , * * YOU WIN * * , in the event that those numbers do not come up : * * YOU DON'T LOSE . * * That is why people have so much fun with craps . You can throw a bet up on the ' 8 ' . As the game is going , if an 8 comes up , you get paid , if a 2,3,4,5,9,10,11 , or 12 is rolled you do n't lose your money . But every time the 8 is rolled you 're going to get paid . You can put money on all those numbers . As often as they come up you get paid , you can even ' press ' the bet , which means doubling your bet at any time . * * 8 . * * So in our fictional game being played so far , the roller originally a rolled a 6 , and you have made am extra bet on an 8 . Every time an 8 comes up you win extra , no other number hurts you ( EXCEPT the 7 ) . Your sitting at the table and the roller keeps rolling a 5 as well . You say shit , I 'm gon na throw money up on the 5 , and so now you have bets on the 5 , 8 , & do n't forget our originally the number the 6 : all of these are winners . * * this is getting long so I will add more in a follow up comment * *", "I 'll leave it to others to explain the rules , but I will just leave this thought : Stick to the pass line bets . And when a point is established , back your original bet with a large ' odds ' bet . This odds bet is paid at true odds , no house edge . That 's the best bet you 're ever going to get in a casino . All that exotic looking stuff in the middle of the table ? Learn them if you want , but they are sucker bets . Remember that when you see people throwing chips all over the table like they 're big hot shot high rollers , and do n't be intimidated . They 're idiots playing some of the worst bets in the house .", "strongo did a really good job explaining pass / don't pass bets , and junkeee999 added a good bit about the true odds offered behind your pass line bet .

It's like they have their own little neighborhoods! 🏠🛍️\n\nThe city of London is like a parent or guardian that takes care of everything in the big city.

I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : \" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster \" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . \" Greater London \" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having \" city \" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of \" The London Borough of * whatever * \" but a couple are called \" The City of * whatever * \" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called \" The City of London \" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word \" City \" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying \" The City \" is a shorthand way of saying \" financial services companies \" , just as in the US saying \" Wall Street \" has the same connotation . Despite being a borough of Greater London , the City of London has many special privileges and rights , which have been laid down over about a thousand years worth of legislation . In particular it elects its own mayor , known as \" The Lord Mayor of London \" although this is now a ceremonial position rather than one with any specific power . The City has its own separate police force from the rest of Greater London , has many of its own laws , and ( somewhat controversially ) positions on the City of London council are voted for by the corporations that are based in the City , rather than the ( very few ) people who live there , as happens in every other UK election .", "> How is it that a city exists within a city ? but to be honest , what does it change ? we have countries ( Vatican ) withing countries ( Italy ) , so city ( City of London ) within the city ( London / Greater London ) is not problematic at all . > But trapping nations is not just Italy 's thing for there 's also Lesotho , in South Africa which is both the largest encircled country at 70 times Vatican City 's size and the most populated with over 2,000,000 citizens . from [ CGPGrey bizarre borders ] ( URL_0 )", "This gets * very * confusing and I do n't have time to go into it all right now . Just as a quick starter though , the City of London ( note capitalisation ) is actually a separate entity to the larger metropolitan area of London , the capital city of the UK . It 's the most ancient part of London and is relatively tiny , being nicknamed ' The Square Mile ' as it 's , whaddya know , approximately 1sq mile in size .

Are you ready? 🤔\n\nLong time ago, in the world of newspapers, there was this really important person called Mr. Rupert Murdoch. He owned lots of newspapers and TV stations, and people read them to learn about what was going on in the world. But, sometimes, people don't always tell the truth in their newspapers, and Mr. Murdoch's newspapers were no exception. 😟\n\nA few years ago, someone discovered that some of Mr. Murdoch's employees were doing something naughty. They were hacking into people's phones! *gasp* That means they were secretly listening to people's private conversations, reading their text messages, and even hacking into their voicemails! 🚫\n\nIt's kind of like if someone was sneaking into your room and reading all your secret notes or peeking into your phone to see what you're saying to your friends.

murder . One small detail of the case was that her family insisted she was still alive ( possibly run away , kidnapped , whatever ) because phone records showed her voice mail was still being remotely checked regularly and some messages were even deleted . It turns out a News of the World ( one of Murdoch 's companies ) employee was the one checking the voice mail as a way to get story leads . Messages were deleted so the voice mail box would n't fill up , blocking new messages . Deleting those messages is destroying evidence and is terrible because even the tiniest clue can catch a murderer . This catches the public 's attention , more investigation is done and it comes out that this has happened several times before . Most notably , another Murdoch employee allegedly tried to grease palms with September 11th first responders to get info from cell phones in the same vein . This REALLY catches the public 's attention . So , the debate , if we can call it that , is whether or not it 's ok for reporters to illegally access your phone messages , delete the ones that could possibly catch the person who murdered you , etc . And , that 's only the thing they were * caught * doing .", "OK so here 's my take Murdoch 's British empire has also * * admitted * * to paying police for private information ( which is illegal ) , paying hush money to people they hacked , hacked lots of famous people and common peoples phones including murdered school girl Milly Dowler , Royal aides to the Royal Family etc They have also been * * accused * * of hacking the phones of the family of 9/11 victims and that of soldiers killed in Iraq - actually up to 3000 people are thought to be possible victims ( this number relates to the number of people whose personal details were found in documents belonging to the people sent to Jail for phone hacking ) OK so we have established they are defiantly up to no good - but how high does the corruption go Well here are some big people to take a hit * * Arrested * * Rebekah Brooks - head of Murdoch 's empire for the whole of Britain Andy Coulson - was the editor of News of the World ( the paper responsible for the hacking ) whilst the hacking was taking place BUT he was later given a job as the director of communications for the GOVERNMENT and was a spokesperson for DAVID CAMERON the BRITISH PRIME MINISTER - it is thought that the close ties between Cameron and Coulson got a front page endorsement on News Corp. news papers saying we support Cameron for Prime Minister last election OK who else has taken a fall ? Well the top Police Officer in Britain and his no.2 have both had to step down . There are many more but you get the point - the corruption has landed many higher ups in hot water . So what does all this mean ? Well you have this corrupt all powerful media group who get themselves into the inner circle of politicians ( from all sides of politics ) in exchange for their support in elections , at least the last two British governments were openly backed by News Corps media empire . So the real problem is that we have these people who we know are crooks and liars , and they are getting important government jobs holding lots of sway over elective officials - which has helped them get away with allot , for example blocking investigations into their illegal activity ( that 's right News of the World have recently been found to actively obstruct activation into their illegal activity ) . So that 's pretty bad for Britain , what about the rest of the World ? Well , so far their are a few investigations underway by the FBI and such into Murdoch 's empire in the US , but nothing of the same scope as the UK . But Murdoch owns Fox News as you may be aware , and given their general bias many have suggested what is going on in Britain is likely to be going on in America also . The phone hacking AND the closeness of these crooks and liars to US politicians . hope that helps", "Why it 's so important : It 's revealed a culture of intimidation in Rupert Murdoch 's businesses . Whistleblower ( a man who died shortly into this scandal ) testimony explains how Rupert Murdoch is basically a mafia - king . He uses his media empire to influence politics , sometimes in a threatening way . In summary , a Private Individual , has been using his means to threaten Public servants . The whole scandal just really shows how fucked up the media is . Him especially ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 334.0}

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Atoms are really cool, and they have all sorts of properties like being different shapes, sizes, and colors. But how do they get those properties? Well, it's all about the tiny things inside them called particles! 🚀\n\nYou know how a toy car has different parts like wheels, body, and windshield? Atoms are kind of like toy cars too, but instead of parts, they have tiny particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are like the different parts of the car, and they help give the atom its special properties! 🚗\n\nProtons are like the wheels of the car. They're inside the atom, and they make it move around (orbit) in different ways. Neutrons are like the body of the car. They help keep everything stable and give the atom its shape. And electrons are like the windshield wipers. They go around really fast and help keep everything clean and shiny! 💧\n\nWhen you have the right number of protons, neutrons, and electrons inside an atom, it's like a perfectly balanced car.

Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .", "The periodic table is full of patterns . The ' magic numbers ' of chemistry are * 2 * 2 + 6 = 8 * 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 = 36 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 = 54 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 86 Electrons travel in ' shells ' and it takes 2 to fill the first shell , 6 to fill the second , 10 to fill the third , 16 to fill the fourth , and 18 to fill shells the fifth / sixth / seventh shells . Atoms strongly ' like ' to have perfectly filled shells . If need be , they 'll share , give , or take electrons from other atoms to get perfectly filled shells . ----- The rightmost column made of Noble Gases . They already have perfect shells . For the most part , Noble Gas atoms do n't react with other atoms . The left - most column is alkali metals . They have perfect shells plus one extra electron . They readily give away this extra electron to drop down to having perfect shells . Atoms in the left column tend to go ' boom ' in water . ( Look up sodium and water videos on YouTube . ) Carbon is part of column 14 . At 6 , carbon is 4 away from the magic number in the right hand column . Carbon needs a whopping 4 electrons to get to shell perfection , and makes all sorts of electron swaps to get there . Since carbon can make four electron swaps , it can make a huge number of compounds and is one of the key ingredients in the complex chemicals that make life possible . Column 11 is copper , silver , and gold . These are all easy - to - shape metals that conduct electricity . They 're all commonly used in electronic devices .", "This will probably get deleted as an improper answer , but whatever . Are you familiar with the [ Khan Academy ] ( URL_0 ) ? You can start the basic chemistry videos and it will explain your question in detail . With that said , there are already a couple of good explanations here ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 329.3333333333333}

And while we 're at it , clock speed is not a very good indicator of the actual performance of a CPU . There are lots of factors . the clock speed tells us the rate at which electrons travel through the circuit and settle down . It 's called a machine cycle . CPUs have an instruction set , that is a set of basic operations that they can perform . Each operation takes a certain number of machine cycles to complete . These operations are things like \" add , \" \" multiply , \" \" logical and , \" or \" memory read . \" There 's also something called pipelining , which allows multiple instructions to take place at the same time , but then you have to be careful about dependence on other instructions ! ( if instruction A adds two numbers and instruction B adds the result to a 3rd number , B has to wait for A ! but if A adds two numbers and B adds two different numbers , they may be able to run simultaneously . Good pipelining / optimization can detect this ) So pipelining and optimization is important . Many instructions , particularly memory reads , which are extremely important , and a good portion of what a program is doing at any given time , take several machine cycles to execute . And memory reads are really common . So the speed of communication between CPU and memory is really important , because if memory reads take fewer machine cycles , whole programs will run faster . There 's also special memory that exists on the CPU chip , called registers . The size and number of registers are also extremely important . But even above all that , the program that 's running and the way that it 's optimized for the CPU will probably have the most impact of all on performance . Also important , and increasingly so , is parallelization , which is where we tie in GPUs . A CPU runs one instruction after another ( with some pipelining , but it 's limited how much you can do at once with pipelining , you still need instructions to happen in order ) . Nowadays there are multiple cores , that means that there are two or more CPUs that can be executing their own instructions in sequence . You can do two or more things at once . This requires a more complex branch of programming called \" parallel programming \" to take full advantage of . ( CPUs can also have threads , which basically means that one CPU runs two lists of instructions by rapidly interleaving them ) . GPUs are the ultimate parallel processors . Unlike a CPU , a GPU does n't rely on rapidly executing a list of instructions in order , instead it executes a LOT of instructions simultaneously . Potentially thousands at once . This means that the things they are suited for are different . While a CPU is good for sequential ( serial ) operations where later instructions are dependent on the results of earlier instructions , GPUs are suited for problems where there is n't a lot of dependence . Like graphics . If you want to rapidly update every pixel on screen within 1/60th of a second , or do a bunch of matrix computations for 3D gaming ( did you see the top post on /r / askscience about linear algebra today ? ) , you do n't want a CPU to do millions of sequential operations . You want a GPU to do a couple massively parallel operations . That 's a high level description of the difference", "A CPU is like a guy running a parkour race , he can go as fast as he wants , he can make decisions , take shortcuts , but there is only one of him . So in an hour , he could have moved one person 5 miles . Even if you have multiple CPUs , they can each take their own route . A GPU is like a marching band in a parade . They all have to move in the same direction at the same time , only as fast as the slowest member , and coordinating to keep together . the route has to be planned out , and closed to other traffic , However if there were 100 band members , even if they only go 1 mile in an hour , they have moved 20 times as much as the single runner .", "CPUs and GPUs work a little differently . CPUs are great monotaskers while GPUs are awesome at multitasking . Your CPU has eight cores , and each of those eight cores is running at 3.5 GHz . Your GPU on the other hand ... URL_0 ... has 28 compute units and over 200 assorted smaller specialized units for things like texturing and coloring ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 337.6666666666667}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nPointers in Programming ? Can someone please explain pointers to me ? Like I m 5 ! Using examples with some kind of animal would be nice , but not necessary :D Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *grin* Pointers are like special helpers in programming that let you talk to other things in the computer. Imagine you have a toy box full of your favorite stuffed animals. Each animal has a special name, like \"Bear,\" \"Doggie,\" or \"Kitty.\"\n\nNow, imagine you want to give a hug to all of them at the same time. You could say \"Bear hug! *hug* Doggy hug! *hug* Kitty hug! *hug*\", but that would be a lot of work! Instead, you can just say \"Hug all stuffed animals in the toy box!\" and the computer knows exactly what you want.\n\nPointers are like those magic words that help the computer understand what you want to do. They point to things in the computer, like a toy, a picture, or a piece of text, and let you do things to them. For example, you could say \"Pointer, go get the Bear!\" and the computer will go get the Bear from your toy box. Or you could say \"Pointer, make the Dooggie's eyes bigger!\" and the computer will make the Dooggie's eyes bigger. It's like giving instructions to your toys, but instead of talking to them directly, you use the pointers to tell the computer", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey",

This address is just a number : you can think of them like individual street numbers on a VERY long street . Sometimes different programs or parts of a program need to use the same data . Instead of sending all the data , it is easier just to send the address where the data starts instead . This is known as a pointer . So a pointer is just an address ( memory index ) telling you where the data starts . It points to the data . If methods or programs are sharing data using pointers , then they are really accessing exactly the same data in the same memory location . If one program or method changes this data , the other program can now only read the new data . The old data is lost ( it has been overwritten ) to both programs . EDIT : This is just an example of pointer use . They have many other uses including indexing data , linked lists , program counters , stack pointers , etc .", "Scruffy the squirrel was an old squirrel whose teeth were n't so strong . He needed to give his walnut to his friend crackWalnut ( ) before he could eat it . But Scruffy had magical \" pass by value \" hands . If he picked up his walnut and just gave it crackWalnut ( ) , then his friend would only get a * duplicate * of the walnut , and Scruffy 's walnut would remain uncracked . So Scruffy wrote down the location of the walnut and gave * that * to crackWalnut ( ) ( the scrap of paper he wrote on was duplicated like always ) , who would then go dig it up , crack it , and bury it again .", "Sure , a pointer is just an ID that \" points \" to a space in the computer 's memory , typically allocated for you by the OS on request . As for animals , imagine that you had a really long road and you subdivided it into lots and lots of squares . Millions of squares in a row , and then you numbered them from 0 to whatever the last square was [ 1 ] . Now imagine that someone lives on the side of the road and manages it [ 2 ] . Now let 's say you want a chicken , so you ask the guy that lives on the road for a chicken . He goes out on his own , gets a chicken and puts it where there 's space available on the road [ 3 ] . He also gives you an index card with the number of the square he put the chicken in [ 4 ] . You can now visit this chicken and have it do things by looking at the index card and going to that square . You know that you will always find your chicken there and that no other animal will occupy that space . Horses take up four sequential spaces on the road . If you want one , you have to ask the guy that lives on the street . He will find a horse for you and will find four sequential spaces for that horse . When you do n't need the chicken or the horse anymore , you again have to tell the guy that lives on the road . When you tell him , he 'll ask for the number on your index card , then he 'll go to that location and take the animal back to his barn . [ 5 ] If you keep the card around , you may forget and think that a chicken or horse still exists there , and be very disappointed when you find someone else 's donkey in your chicken 's old square . [ 6 ] Also , simply losing the index card or getting rid of it does n't mean that your animal does n't exist at that location anymore [ 7 ] . 1 . This road is the computer 's memory . 2 . This man who lives on the road is the operating system . 3 . This is memory allocation ( malloc or new ) . 4 . The index card is a pointer . 5 . This is memory deallocation ( free or delete ) . 6 . This is a \" dangling pointer \" and is a common cause of program crashes . 7 . This is what causes memory leaks . [ edit ] - for the really picky , the part about the guy taking the animal back to his barn is not entirely true .

Even though they're the same toy, they like them for different reasons. That's because we're all special and different, and that's what makes us who we are! 🎀\n\nIt's the same with mental traits. Mental traits are like special powers that help us think and learn. Everyone has different mental traits, and they can be influenced by their genes too. 🤔\n\nSo, just like how some people might have straight hair or tall, some people might have different mental traits too.

However , the variation between members of the same ethnic group is drastic enough that the averaged difference is relatively small . Also , race in general is a really poorly defined atribute , especially considering how much interbreeding goes on regularly .", "Because race is an ambiguous social term , not a biological one . Let 's invent two races . We 'll call then : Blues and Greens . Now , let 's try and define these races * biologically . * Ok , seems easy , right ? Blues are the ones that are blue , and greens are the ones that are green . Now let 's ask ourselves , can these races differ , mentally ? Yes and no . Yes , it may be possible that Blues , statistically , succeed better than Greens based on some sort of test . But also no , because the results of that test , and any statistical difference mentally , * has nothing to do with their race * . After all , we defined their race * only * by their color . Any apparent statistical differences between them in other ways are * * purely coincidental . * * For example , if there was some law that required that Greens were to be lobotomized at birth , then it may be technically true that Greens do not perform as well as Blues on mental tests . But , again , that has nothing to do with the fact that they are Green ( biologically ) . If you altered the circumstances that resulted in the poor performance of Greens , then it 's very well possible they would be on par , or even better than Blues on intelligence , while still being Green . So while we could acknowledge the difference , it would be inaccurate and inappropriate to attribute the difference as some secondary quality of our defined race . What happens if we change our definition , then ? Instead of simply saying that Blues are blue and Greens are green , we 'll say that Blues are a combination of physical and mental traits that are commonly associated with Blues and likewise for Green . This really does n't solve anything and in fact makes it worse . If you incorporate the apparent mental advantages of Blues into the definition of the Blue race , then you 're basically begging the question ; yeah Blues are better , mentally , because you 've defined them to be so . More importantly , since the mental differences are statistical , what do you do when you come across a lower than average Blue , or a greater than average Green ? Since you made the mental ability a defining trait , then technically a dumb Blue * is n't * a Blue nor is a smart Green a Green . It just complicates the issue without resolving anything . To tie this back to the real world , the fact is , we can ( and do ) acknowledge statistical differences among groups of the population with respect to their race , both physically and mentally . But it is not appropriate to then suggest that those attributes are inherent to that race , that race has * anything * to do with those attributes . Race is a poorly defined label , even when you reduce it to a simple acknowledgement of skin color . And it is n't just about political correctness or racism either . Thinking that things like intelligence are qualities of race cloud the real issue . For example , in the United States , minorities make up more of the poorer and lower social and economic classes than whites do . So , as a consequence , the average quantity and quality of education among minorities is generally less than that of whites . So * of course * tests of mental abilities will result in minorities performing statistically worse than whites , * but that has nothing to do with their race . * So if you walk away from that study concluding that minorities are less intelligent than whites , then you 're ignoring the issue of * why * they performed poorly and , therefore , are precluding efforts to try and remedy what is most likely a problem . After all , we can at least recognize poverty and lack of education as a problem that is theoretically fixable . If you just make it a matter of race , you 're basically saying there is nothing you can do about it , it 's just the way they are . And it is n't .", "Biologically : No reason at all .

Let's talk about depression. 😊\n\nDepression is a big word for a complicated feeling in our brain, but don't worry, I'll explain it in a way that's easy to understand. 🤓\n\nYour brain is like a really cool supercomputer, and it's responsible for everything you do, like thinking, feeling, and moving. It's made up of tiny little things called neurons that talk to each other, kind of like how you and your friends chat in the playground. 🏧\n\nWhen you have depression, it's like there's a problem with the wiring in your brain. It's almost like someone knocked over a lot of the connections between the neurons, making it harder for them to talk to each other. This can make you feel really sad, anxious, and tired, and it can be really hard to do things you used to enjoy. 😔\n\nIt's not just a matter of feeling sad, though. Depression is actually a physical thing that happens in your brain. It can change the way your neurons work, and it can even change the shape of your brain! 🧬 It's kind of like how you might get stronger from practicing a sport, but with depression, it's like someone

psychological . I know in my heart that no matter what circumstances I could ever be subjected to would never change that or get rid of it , it would be more of a genetics thing I suppose . Lately I tried to explain it to a friend and the only thing I can really use as an analogy for me are paper towels . Some are produced cheap and are shit , they tear and do n't soak up shit . These paper towels are still trying to be good but poor genes have them already behind a better crafted towel . Now let 's pretend we have two hammocks with one being designed using the shitty paper towel and one using the really strong and absorbent towel . If you consider each one of life 's problems and also just poor genes as a marble and you were to drop a marble into the hammocks they would eventually fall thru and you would be screwed . I view talking and medicine as a removal of a marble or two and at the end of the day I suppose each person develops ways of removing marbles but the marbles do n't stop coming . This whole life is just a flimsy , soaked towel and I lost my marbles .", "No one really knows what causes depression . There 's debate about whether depression is a single disease or several diseases with similar symptoms . Most antidepressants work on the neurotransmitters serotonin , norepinephrine , and/or dopamine . There is also evidence that drugs targeting the NMDA receptor can also be effective . People respond to all sorts of different drugs . Even more confusingly , people who do not respond to one serotonin drug may do well on a different serotonin drug . People do have physical symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , appetite changes , etc . If these symptoms are driven by the brain or if they come from some other mechanism is n't really known either . There are some diseases like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Fibromyalgia which have a strong statistical relationship with mental health disorders such as depression , but we do n't understand the root cause enough to say for sure how they are related .", "The ' brain ' and body in general is always trying to equalize a ' chemical normal ' which is defined in real - time by your static DNA & dynamic RNA signatures . All incoming stimuli ( physiological & neurological ) to the person is evaluated against long - term memory to match that ' normal ' - in order to generate a ' key ' which is compared to that person 's life experiences of similar events in similar context . Minor variations can also be attributed to your ' waking period ' memory , but as implied , these are only relevant to situations learned in the immediate ' awake ' period since last REM sleep . That key comparison will return a ' positive ' branch if the historical experience has a tendency toward restoring ' normal ' metabolic equilibrium . A ' negative ' if the experience history is deviating from your ' normal ' ... --- or an undefined state - which generates a new ' experience node ' at the junction of those unresolved situations - ready for a new outcome to be acquired and learned into experience . Only the two ( + /- ) outcomes are allowed in order to eliminate fence - sitting deadlock of a situation . This process is modified over time by frequency of ' hits ' and currency of ' most recent ' hit - to develop a scalar response in context with changing reality . * * Depression is seeded * * - when the keyed experience returns a negative - which in turn keys to another ' negative ' node and so on ... the ' depth ' of depression is directly related to the number of negative recursions that occur before a ' positive ' or ' new ' experience node is reached . Where you go after that - depends on the forward branching of subsequent situations , experiences and nodes . Think of it like a huge ' tree ' of life experience . You are born with no experience at ' ground level ' and grow outward toward the sky . New ' situations ' ( raindrops ) may fall onto an existing leaf , or branch -- or fall unhindered through to the ground . How the water drop hits & flows down is entirely dependent on where it lands - or indeed if the leaf / branch exists at all ! There 's another dimension to all this , but the above may help you see the light at the end f the tunnel . good luck !"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 309.6666666666667}

but it feels better if they are n't present ( ie . They would cause discomfort if you were n't already desensitized ) . That 's why it feels better when you pop them ( \" cracking \" your neck ) .", "Due to a lack of real expertise in the comments on this question , I 'll chime in . This has NOTHING to do with the noise , everything to do with the stability of your neck . When you want to \" crack \" you neck , you are actually feeling a sense of limitation of motion in a part of your neck . When you \" crack \" it , you are actually forcing some part of the neck to over - compensate and become hyper - flexible . This hyper - flexibility stretches some of the joints between vertebrae ( and there are several that it could be ) , and this stretching causes bubble to form , they were n't always present as some redditors suggest . The bubble formation is in line with physic 's gas laws ( notably P1V1 = P2V2 ) that say when the volume of a joint space increase , the pressure inside the joint decreases . Decreased pressure ( especially in a rapid format ) causes gases that are otherwise dissolved in your fluids ( N2 , O2 , CO2 ) to form little bubbles , much like opening a soda forms bubbles . The formation of a bubble makes a noise , and that noise is a popping sound . It is also amplified greatly in your neck because this happens so close to your ears . These bubbles eventually dissolve back into the fluids of your body , which is why you ca n't crack your knuckles several times in a row . If you can crack a joint several times in a row , it is likely not a bubble formation ( called a cavitation ) . To the long term effects ... \" cracking \" your spine alone will not cause an issue . However , both the immobility of some segments that cause the feeling of needing to crack and the hypermobility of the habit of cracking do create structural instabilities in how your spine supports your body , moves and even the function of the nerves that radiate from the spine . \" Cracking \" does NOT FIX ANY PROBLEMS , as some people may suggest . We know this because the sensation of needing to crack does not go away . These long - term instability do create problems , including arthritis , nerve irritation , ligament instabilities and many secondary symptoms as a result of these conditions ( muscle spasms , headaches , abnormal sensations like burning , the list goes on ... ) To address a relevant misconception , a chiropractor ( specifically , a type of chiropractor who performs what is called Structural Chiropractic ) uses analytical methods to identify the regions of the spine responsible for the sensation of needing to crack the spine and corrects those specific regions . With some repeat adjustments and a good doctor , these regions can stabilize , causing the feeling to resolve completely . This comment opens so many doors , but here 's the TL;DR Cracking your neck is forcing a temporary hyper - mobility of the spine to compensate for instability in the spine in some other region . Cracking it does not correct the instability , hence the return of the sensation . Source : I 'm a Structural Chiropractor .", "The explanations of cracking given on this thread are wrong , its is cavitation bubbles . As you manipulate your joints you cause pressure changes in the fluids around your joints . The drop in pressure at certain areas causes voids to form , there are some gases in these bubbles , but compared to the pressure in the surrounding liquids , there may as well not be any , and can be treated as vacuums for the moment . These bubbles then pop as the fluid rushes back in . The small amount of gas inside then becomes over pressurized from the inward momentum of the fluid , and the now tiny bubble 's gasses get forced out violently resulting in a small sonic boom , the crack , and also interestingly sometimes light from the extreme temperatures the pressure brings ( up to several thousand kelvin in certain cavitations ) I do n't know if this applies in our joints though . Also as a note there have been no studies supporting that it causes damage , there was a man who won a joke Nobel , an Ig Nobel Prize , for cracking one hand 's knuckles for 60 years but not the other . There was no differences between the hands . Sources URL_1 URL_0"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 326.0}

Let me tell you a super-duper cool explanation! 🤩\n\nYou know how sometimes you're watching TV and you feel like you're right there in the studio with the actors? *nod* That's because live TV is like a magic show! 🎩 It's like the actors and the crew are performing LIVE for you right then and there. They're doing their thing, and you're watching it all happen in real-time! 🕒\n\nPre-filmed TV, on the other hand, is like a movie. They film it beforehand, and then they show it to you on TV. It's like a special effects movie, but instead of superheroes and robots, it's actors and actresses being their amazing selves! 🎥 They act, they dance, they sing, and they make you laugh, just like in a movie. But, because it's all filmed beforehand, it looks a little different than live TV.

That 's a main reason a movie is released months after filming has completed .", "Basically , you can move the lights around between camera setups , and you can color correct . In normal \" single camera \" shooting ( Like a normal 30 Rock episode ) , you can and do tweak the lighting pretty much every time you move the camera . Shooting live , you need a flatter \" general purpose \" lighting setup that will work okay for every angle but does n't necessarily look amazing at any angle . You also need all lights above the set and out of the field of view of the cameras in live production , whereas in single camera you can have a light or reflector just off camera for a nice effect . You can get the actors to shift their positions to get better shots . You can refresh makeup between takes . All sorts of little subtle things that you 'd never think of if you 've never been on a set because the end result makes it all look like it happens naturally . In live production , you ca n't change your mind about anything once the show starts . In many cases , you will also use different lenses in live production . In a single camera style shoot , you will have a person dedicated to focusing the camera . ( Focus Puller , or 1st Assistant Camera Operator . ) So , if you want to have nice soft blurry backgrounds that make the subject \" pop \" in the frame , you can shoot with \" wide open \" lenses so only the actor is in focus . To do that , you need to rehearse any camera or actor moves so the focus puller knows how to move the focus setting on the lens through the course of the shot . Autofocus is n't good enough because it does n't always know which thing should be in focus , and if it gets confused it may make the whole picture go blurry and useless for a bit which ruins the shot . The 1AC may need to use a measuring tape to check the exact distance between the camera and the actor to make sure things are exactly in focus , which requires walking into the camera 's field of view during shot setup . Obviously during live production you ca n't have somebody stopping the scene to measure , or repeating a take because focus was n't right so you \" stop down \" the lenses or use different lenses so you do n't get the nice soft background and more of the scene is in focus . When framing shots in single camera , you can put the camera right next to an actor 's face to get an interesting shot . But when shooting live , each camera has to stay out of the field of view of every other camera which limits how interesting and varied the shots can be that you can get . One camera person walking right up to an actor would be visible to the other cameras , ruining their shot in a live production so such gags would have to be * very * carefully planned . Then , in editing you would only pick the nicest looking takes , which is obviously impossible when shooting live . Then you send the project off to color correction where the image gets tweaked and refined until it looks like the director / DOP and colorist want it to . This is probably the biggest shift in the image that you are noticing , but it is the hardest to explain . Look for some colorist demo reels on vimeo , and you 'll see some idea of how much the image sometimes gets changed during coloring .", "Two main reasons . One , the cameras used in Live TV are often smaller and lighter , with a single color processing chip that results in less color distinction . Cameras on set are either higher end with multiple color processors , or still use Film . Post processing on higher end cameras allows for more polishing and tailoring forthe final product . Two , live TV is typically recorded at 30 frames per second ( or higher ) . Classic film and TV are shot in 24p ( 24 frames per second ) . This is what gives the biggest difference in the \" feel \" of live vs others . This is also why newer 120Hz+ HDTVs have that akward unnatural feel if you 're watching a show shot in 24p but being displayed at much faster refresh rate . In order to make up for the missing frames , the video processor speeds up and slows down certain frame sets ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 320.6666666666667}

Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts aviator sunglasses* Are you curious about how airplanes can fly upside-down? 😍 Well, you know how you can run around in circles and it looks like you're running upside-down? 🏃‍♀️ It's kind of like that! 😊\n\nYou see, airplanes have special wings that help them fly. The wings are curved on top and flat on the bottom. When an airplane moves forward, the curved top of the wing lifts it up into the air. It's like a big wing that flaps up and down! 🕷️ The flat part of the wing helps the airplane stay on track and go fast.\n\nBut here's the really cool thing about airplanes: they can change the angle of their wings to make them feel like they're flying upside-down! 🤯 When an airplane wants to land or take off from a runway, it uses a special move called \"banking.\" This means the pilot tilts the wings to make the airplane turn. It's like turning a toy car on its side! 🚗 When the wings are tilted, the airplane can feel like it's flying upside-down.

needlessly complicated . I 'll try to explain . Imagine a flat piece of metal moving through the air , it 's flat side is hitting the air \" head - on \" . Now I think most people would agree that just in front of the piece of metal there 'd be air \" bunching up \" , there 'd be slightly higher pressure in front of the plate since it 's sort of pushing the air out of the way and the air ca n't get out of the way fast enough . This means , of course , that just behind the metal plate there is * less * air and less pressure , the air is getting pushed out of the way by the plate and it has to rush in behind it to fill in the void at the back . This is essentially drag , we 're all familiar with this and it 's vital to things like drafting . But now comes the interesting part : Tilt the plate forwards , let 's say by 45 ° . Now your high pressure area is going to be slightly * below * the plate and the low pressure area is going to be slightly * above * . And as you can imagine , if you have high pressure below and low pressure above , you 're going to be pushed * up * and that is basically how wing 's work . Why is this important ? Notice that nowhere did I mention the wing has to have a special \" airfoil \" shape to it . In truth , the airfoil shape of wings is not strictly necessary . It 's there because it makes planes more efficient but really you can get perfectly good lift from a flat piece of metal . A wing will still generate lift when upside - down because it 's fundamental shape has n't changed : it 's still pretty much a flat piece of metal . The fact that the airfoil shape is now upside down only means that the wing is less efficient , so the plane may be slower and probably a bit more unstable , but it * will * still generate lift . The important thing is having that flat piece of metal and angling it correctly towards that stream of air , that angle is the vaunted \" angle of attack \" .", "[ Try the NASA page , its a little easier to read , and there 's a tool to see variations of lift based on angle of attack ] ( URL_0 ) But basically on a plane flying upside up , the wing will generate a finite amount of force up ( called lift ) for various angles that it is vs the wind ( aka angle of attack . ) When it is pointed down enough it will actually create a force that pulls the plane down . You can see that pretty well in the applet , when the angle is -4.03 degrees or so it crosses over that line . Now if you were to flip the plane over the negative sign reverses ( if you do n't see why , ask and I 'll explain that a bit better ) so that the wing would have zero lift at 4.03 degrees and if its more inclined it would produce lift . At 8 degrees it 'd have roughly 250lbs of lift . That airfoil shape is cambered , which basically means its not symmetrical ( same top as bottom ) and that is why the zero lift angle is not zero . IF the airfoil was symmetrical , you might be able to \" see it \" better when you thought about it flying upside down . in that case , the shape of the wing would be the exact same no matter which side you had up , so it would lift just as well upside up as upside down . Sorry if its not at a 5 year old level , but I do n't honestly think you wanted it that reduced . If you have any questions on what I wrote , ask away .. I 'm going to bed now , so it 'll probably be a little while before I get back to you ...", "The thing is , lift is created partly by the shape of the wing , and partly by the angle of attack . [ Picture ] ( URL_0 ) If you turn the plane upside down , you will have to have a bigger angle of attack because the shape of the wing will \" work against you \" . The plane will fly successfully if the lift created by AoA is greater than lift created by the shape plus the weight of the airplane ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 328.0}

Good lenses are fiendishly expensive , and can make the difference between a \" good \" picture and a fantastic picture . A surprisingly good and approachable video about lenses . It 's more focused on video , but the same holds true for still . URL_0", "Depends on the cameras . In some cases , absolutely . In others , definitely not . Most of the time though , the answer is ' sort of . ' A Hasselblad Stellar is entirely identical to a Sony RX-100 except for the case , but when it came out , sold for about five times the price . In this situation , the markup was entirely based on the cachet of owning a Hasselblad . ( Note : It did n't work . The design studio has been shut down , and the Stellar is selling for about 70 % off now . ) In general , a big part of the cost of a camera is derived from the sensor - specifically , the size of it . The Nikon D7100 is quite similar in design and features to the D600 , but the sensor in the D600 is substantially bigger ( full - frame ) , and the camera sells for about twice the price . Does the sensor cost that much more ? No , not really - but building a camera around it requires more engineering as well . Now if you have a built - in lens , your optics are going to get better as the price increases . That 's a HUGE factor in the price of a camera . Ultimately , cameras follow the same curve as almost every other consumer product : As you move from the low end to the high end , the improvement / price starts out high , then moves to a fairly steady value , then drops off . Say that to make a ( separate ) camera at all , you 'll have to sell it for $ 75 . That 's the base cost of making a body , shutter , electronics , and lens . Double the price , and you get MORE than twice as good of a camera - higher precision , better autofocus , more features , bigger and better lens , bigger sensor , the works . Double it again to $ 300 , and you get about twice as good of a camera as the $ 150 was . Another doubling , and you get about 1.6x as good of a camera . Now we 're getting into the diminishing returns area . The key here is n't whether a $ 1200 camera is twice as good as a $ 600 one , but whether it 's enough of an improvement that you are willing to pay an extra $ 600 for it . Is a $ 2400 camera twice as good as a $ 1200 ? Nope , definitely not - but it 's significantly better in a few ways , and those factors might be enough to get you to shell out the difference . Also , if you have $ 30k wrapped up in lenses , is it really outrageous to buy a camera body for $ 4k that is modestly better than a $ 1k one ? Ultimately , what do you want from your camera , and how much are you willing to spend on it ?", "It 's the quality of the components . You do pay a premium for the newest brand name models , so there 's not quite as much disparity as the price sometimes suggests , but for the most part cameras are one of the few products left where you do generally get what you pay for ( along with telescopes and binoculars too ) . The higher end cameras have much finer quality control in the manufacturing process . The crispness and brightness of the image is all dependent on the path the light takes from lens to processor , so you can imagine a perfectly manufactured route for the light is far superior to a lower quality one . Have you ever seen those youtube vids where kids will set up a rube goldbergian style path for a ball to bounce into a red solo cup ? Just how every trampoline or deflection point for that ball has to be perfectly positioned or it will miss the cup . You can think of high end cameras as balls that bounce cleanly into the cup , while lower end cameras still hit the cup , but maybe they skim around the rim and rock it a little . Hah , this analogy is not as good as I thought it would be so I 'll quit here . Tldr ; yep mostly there is that much difference between cheap and high ebd cameras ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 329.6666666666667}

It seems like there's a rule in calculus that doesn't always apply. Let me explain it to you in a way that a five-year-old can understand. 😊\n\nYou know how we have some special rules for adding and multiplying numbers? Like, if you have 2 + 2, you just add them together and get 4. And if you have 2 × 3, you multiply them together and get 6. Well, in calculus, we have some special rules for things like derivatives and integrals too! 🤯\n\nA derivative is like a special kind of addition for functions. If you have a function like x^2, the derivative of x^2 is 2x. That means that if you want to know how fast the function grows or decreases, you can use the derivative to find out! 🚀\n\nBut, just like how you can't always add or multiply numbers in a special way, you can't always find the derivative of every function in the same way either. For example, if you have a function like sin(x), the derivative of that is not always sin(x). 🤔\n\nYou see, the derivative of sin(x) is actually cos(x).

When you write sin^2 x ( a convenient notation ) as ( sin x)^2 the derivative is 2(sin x ) times the derivative of what is inside , which is cos x. So the derivative is 2(sin x)(cos x ) . We can actually use the chain rule in the derivative of x^2 but it 's sort of hidden . Write x^2 as ( x)^2 which has derivative 2x times the derivative of what is inside , which is 1 , but anything times 1 is itself so the derivative is just 2x . In general , the derivative of any differentiable function of the form f(g(x ) ) is f'(g(x))g'(x ) where f ' and g ' are the respective derivatives of f and g , and this is the chain rule . In your example , f(x)=x^2 and g(x)=sin x. Antiderivatives are more complicated because while it is easy to apply the chain rule in one direction ( derivatives ) , it is not so easy to go backwards ( antiderivatives ) . Sometimes u substitution works but not always .", "You mean \" differentiated , \" not \" derived . \" For any function f(x ) , let 's differentiate ( f(x))^2 . By chain rule you get d / dx ( ( f(x))^2 ) = 2 f(x ) f'(x ) When f(x ) = x , you get f'(x ) = 1 so the derivative is just 2x . When f(x ) = sin(x ) , you get derivative of ( f(x))^2 = sin^2(x ) is 2 sin(x ) cos(x ) . So the answer is that when you differentiate the square of something there 's an extra term in the product due to chain rule , it 's just that when you 're trying to differentiate x^2 the extra term is 1 and ends up not mattering . FWIW I think sin^2(x ) is a bad and confusing notation , I much prefer ( sin(x))^2 , but changing standards that have been in use for decades or centuries is really hard .", "It also works if you break it down into multiplication and eliminate the exponentials . So just use the rule for differentiating two functions that are multiplied together . d / dx ( f(x)*g(x ) ) = f'(x)*g(x)+f(x)*g'(x ) Or as I memorized it , \" The derivative of two functions multiplied by each other is the derivative of the first times the second , plus the derivative of the second times the first \" x^2 = x*x d / dx ( x^2 ) = d / dx ( xx ) d / dx ( xx ) = d / dx ( x)x+xd / dx(x ) d / dx ( x)x+x*d / dx(x ) = 1x+x1=2x now for sin(x ) ( sin(x))^2 = sin(x)*sin(x ) d / dx ( sin(x))^2 = d / dx ( sin(x)sin(x ) ) d / dx ( sin(x)sin(x))=d / dx(sin(x))sin(x)+sin(x)d / dx(sin(x ) ) d / dx(sin(x))sin(x)+sin(x)d / dx(sin(x))=cos(x)sin(x)+sin(x)cos(x ) cos(x)sin(x)+sin(x)cos(x)=2cos(x)sin(x ) Also , you could look at it from the physical representation perspective . Graph sin(x)^2 . Look at that , and try to figure out approximately what the derivative of that should look like ( ie a graph of the slope of that curve ) . Now graph 2sin(x ) . That 's obviously wrong ! It 's 2 when it should be zero ! Then try graphing 2sin(x)cos(x ) . Which one looks right ? The one that is right !"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 321.3333333333333}

Let's talk about something important called \"corruption.\" Corruption is when someone uses their power or position for personal gain, without following the rules or being fair. Like if you were playing a game and you cheated to win, that would be corruption!\n\nNow, imagine you're a politician and you want to make some changes in the city where you live. You talk to lots of people who have ideas about how to make the city better, but they can't do it alone. They need your help! So, they give you money to help you do the work. That's okay! Politicians need money to do their job. But here's the thing: if you only help the people who give you money, that's corruption! You're not being fair to everyone else who wants to help.\n\nThat's kind of like what lobbyists do. They are like special helpers who give politicians money to help them make changes in the city. But if the politicians only help the lobbyists who give them money, that's corruption! It's not fair to the other people who want to help.\n\nSo, campaign donations and access to politicians can be a problem if they're not done in a fair and honest way.

lobbyist in the US so I can give you a perspective different than most of the others here . First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else . They 're just a reflection that people do n't like to see .", "It is considered to be corrupt by a lot of people , in fact that s the definition of corruption , although the government wo n't admit it .", "Short answer : it depends on the country . I try to answer this without bringing my own opinion into it : Most countries have some forms you could ( depending on your opinions ) call legal corruption . For example : some democracies have non - professional parliaments - that means that the law - makers have their own job and business and only go to the parliament twice a year or so ( Switzerland would be an example for such a system ) . This means , of course , that these politicians have economical interests . You could argue , that this is some kind of corruption , since these guys will vote for their interests . On the other hand , people who vote them into the parliament know this . A teacher might vote for another teacher and a farmer for another farmer - since they know they will have roughly the same interests . In the US it is legal to donate for political campaigns - but you have to do so un - anonymously . So you are free to see , who finances Obama and who finances Romney . So the idea would be , that you could look up the donators which would tell you , which interests the politician will represent . This is true for most countries and most countries regulate this process in some forms ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 322.3333333333333}

But, you don't have a toy car engine that can make it go that fast. What do you do? *exaggerated expression* You give it a little push, and BAM! 💥 The toy car zooms away! 🏎️ That's kind of like how a transformer works! 🤖\n\nIt takes the electricity from a higher voltage and slowly makes it go slower, like a toy car on a downhill track! 🏙️ It's called \"transforming\" the energy because it changes the voltage, like turning the car's speed up or down! 😊\n\nBut, here's the really cool part: the transformer doesn't change the amount of electricity. It just makes it go faster or slower, depending on what you want! 🤯 So, just like how you can make your toy car go faster by giving it a push, a transform", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "",

transformer ? The EMF induced in the secondary coil is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil . More loops means a higher magnetic field ( and therefore flux ) inside the secondary coil . Less coils means less flux and therefore less induced EMF . So in a step - down transformer , the primary coil has more loops than the secondary coil .", "Hey there ! Totally not my field , but I minored in physics in my undergrad years ! Think of electricity as water in a hose . In this analogy , the current ( measured in amperes ) would be analogous to current of the water through the pipe- as in , how much water moves through a given section in a period of time . Voltage would be the speed of the water both in the hose and coming out the end of the hose . How does this help us understand transformers ? Let 's say you want to increase the voltage of the electricity . This can be done without having to raise the power supply at all , using what 's called a transformer . Put your thumb over the end of the hose- suddenly the water starts shooting out , and you can feel the increase of pressure under your thumb . The amount of water passing through any given section of the hose at any point in time has not changed at all , but by shrinking the opening with your thumb , in order to keep the current constant , the water has to speed up coming out the end , which lets you [ spray your backyard enemies ] ( URL_1 ) with a more effective water laser . How does a transformer actually do this , since there 's no real \" hole \" to shrink ? Easy ! Take a piece of metal ( your transformer 's \" core \" ) and wrap your wires around it like [ this . ] ( URL_0 ) ( Please note that the transformer setup in this diagram would do the opposite , and * decrease * the voltage ) All moving electric charges ( in this case , the electrons moving through the wire wrapped around the left side of the core ) create a magnetic field . As you can see , the left side has fewer turns than the right side . The electrons in the wire on the right are influenced by the magnetic field created by the ones on the left , and they begin moving . This creates an \" induced \" current in the right side . Energy must be conserved ! Because there are more coils on the right , there are more electrons under the influence than you started with ! So the voltage decreases ( or increases ) based on how many turns of wire are wrapped around each side . Unfortunately , there is one discrepancy with the hose analogy- the current in the wire has to increase if the voltage decreases , ( so that energy is conserved across the transformer ) and vise versa . The core plays a pretty important role , too ! It magnifies the electromagnetic effects because it is full of electrons that mimic the ones in the wire . Does that help ? ( It 's been a looong time since undergrad so if I 've bungled it anyone is welcome to correct me )", "Magnetic fields induce voltage into conductors ( like copper wire ) . To increase a magnetic field , one trick is to coil copper wire . The flow of electricity creates a magnetic field along the length of the wire , but it is relatively weak . If you coil the wire , the field compounds it 's effects and changes it 's magnetic flow to be around the entire coil instead of the wire alone . Certain materials are also used to further increase magnetism by allowing magnetic field lines to move . Like electricity , magnetic field flux lines move through materials differently . Magnetic field flow is called reluctance . Iron is very reluctant , and allows the magnet field lines to become stronger . Placing an iron core inside a coil increases the magnetic field strength , which increases the ability it has to induce voltage into a nearby copper conductor . Smaller coil , higher voltage , next to a large coil , and you 've stepped down the voltage , but what you lose in volts has become amperage . If you use a higher amperage , larger coil , and place a circuit with a smaller coil next to it , you induce a higher voltage . Again , you lose the amperage , but gain the voltage , or electrical pressure ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 300.6666666666667}

"answers": ["As more people invest in a single market ( eg housing ) this drives up the value and subsequently the cost of the market . However there comes a tipping point when the costs become too high for investment to be attractive any more . All of a sudden you have a market full of expensive goods with no - one willing to buy . This is the ' the bubble burst ' moment .", "A bubble happens when a lot of people are trying to buy things just because they think that the price of them is rising , and they can resell them later at an even higher price . If you see that last week the price of a house was $ 100,000 and this week it 's $ 200,000 , then you might feel bad that you did n't buy the house last week and sell it today and make $ 100,000 . Then next week , maybe the house costs $ 300,000 . You finally decide that you 've waited long enough , and you need to buy a house and make $ 100,000 in a week . So you , and probably all of your friends , all decide to buy houses . What you do n't realize is that the only reason that the price of the houses is going up is because you and all your friends decided to buy houses , which made the demand for housing go up , which made the price of houses go up , which made more people want to try to buy a house in order to make some money , which made the price of houses go up , and so on . The problem is , at some point , you all realize that you 've all been trying to make money buying and selling houses , but there 's so many houses that no one even wants to live in them , which is the whole point of a house . As soon as the first person realizes that there are more houses than there are people interested in living in them , he sells his house , makes some money , and then does n't buy another one . His neighbor sees him do that and realizes he needs to sell his house quickly too . before you know it , everyone is trying to sell a house and no one wants to buy one . Now , instead of everyone seeing the house prizes rising and rushing to buy at a low price so that they can make some money , they see house prices falling so they rush to sell at a high price so that they can avoid losing money . But if no one wants to live in the houses , they 'll have to sell them for pretty cheap if they want to sell them at all . So in the end , whoever was the first in and the first out ends up making some money , and a lot of people end up losing lots of money .", "There are a bunch of people in a town . They all live in apartment , and some of them are looking to move to houses . The house - builders in this town see this demand and start building houses . When they look for people to buy these houses , there is a lot of demand , so this can push prices higher as there is more competition for supply . ( the opposite of competition on the supply - side , where it brings prices down ) A bunch of people buy houses at at these high - demand prices , and prices continue to climb as demand remains high . But , once the price gets too high , or most of the demand subsides from everyone wanting a house having one , there suddenly becomes much lower demand , dropping the cost of purchasing a house . Those that have already purchased a price now are seeing themselves as losing money , and want to move back into an apartment while getting rid of the house ; this cranks up supply , causing a precipitous drop on prices for these houses . It continues until the prices reach a level that demand begins to stabilize at a new level . --- When we talk about a bubble , it really comes down to a market of low - supply , high - demand quickly changing to a high - supply , low - demand market . The major problem is that both versions help themselves : high - demand brings people in to invest and take advantage of the price increases , while low - demand gets people to try to push away from the market , making supply even higher ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 309.0}

We are pretty good at figuring out how big things are , how much mass they have , and how fast they are moving . When we look at a galaxy , we like to figure out things like how much mass it has , how fast it 's rotating , and how big it is . We even take a close look at how fast the galaxy is rotating at different points , for example the middle , the outside , and places in between . From what we know of mass , gravity , and motion , we would expect that far edge of a galaxy would rotate slower than a spot closer to the middle . If you make a graph of the speed stars are rotating about a galaxy versus how far away they are from the center , it 's called a rotation curve . That graph should look like a children 's slide . It goes up really quickly from the center , and then slides down and down as you go towards the edge of the galaxy . The problem is , it does n't . When we actually look at galaxies , and draw the graph , it looks like a cliff instead . It goes up quickly ( as predicted ) , but then it stays more or less the same , all the way out . So now we have a problem . Something is wrong with the picture . It 's possible that we do n't know as much about gravity as we think . However , every experiment we 've tried , even really , really complex ones , tells us that we 've got gravity nailed . It 's also possible that we do n't understand how to measure speed and mass from a long way away . Again , however , we 've done a lot of experiments , and they all tell us we know what we 're doing . So we need a way to explain why the galaxies are n't moving the way we expect . There are a number of theories that try to explain this . The dark matter theory basically says that there is a lot more mass than we thought in a galaxy . When we estimate the mass of a galaxy , we 're mostly doing it by looking at the things we can SEE , like stars ( nice and shiny ) . But what if there was a lot of mass we COULDN'T see ? Well , there are black holes . But the truth is we can still ' see ' those by the way they warp other stars light , and make them move . Even accounting for black holes , galaxies are still way short on matter to explain the motion we see . So what if there was matter we could n't see , but it was really spread out , so we would n't see it bending light , or moving stars around ? What if there was a whole bunch of it ? Well , it turns out that if there WAS a bunch of matter spread around that we could n't see , then all our observations would actually work out again . There are other explanations for why our observations may be off , but most are dependent on us being wring about things we 're pretty sure we 're not wrong about , like how gravity works . There are also other observations that do n't match reality unless we add in ' dark matter ' . So right now , assuming that there is a crap - load of matter in the universe that we simply ca n't see is the best way we have to explain why our observations do n't match our predictions .", "Observations of the universe 's properties do not match up with known laws of physics . There is not enough mass according to observations . One theory is that there is \" dark \" matter . Matter which does not interact with the electromagnetic spectrum and is therefor not directly detectable . No one knows \" why \" we have dark matter . If we do , there is n't a reason for its existence no more than there is a reason for normal matter . Its role is important as it helps valiudate the Big Bang theory and is crucial to the formation / structure of the universe itself", "Nobody knows but it is thought that it exerts the force of gravity on normal matter but interacts with no other forces . That is why it 's dark , it does n't interact with electromagnetism , it does n't absorb or emit light ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 324.0}

Well, the Earth is warm inside, just like a big ball of dirt and water. And when it's warm inside, it makes the air around it move up and cool off. That's why you feel the wind blowing on your face when you're outside on a sunny day. It's like the Earth is taking a deep breath and blowing its hot air out into the world! *makes blowing gestures*\n\nBut that's not all! When the Earth blows its hot air out, it goes up into the sky and meets with other moving air. They start to swirl around together, like they're dancing up there. That's why you might see the wind rustling the leaves on trees or blowing clouds across the sky. It's like a great big game of tag! *giggles*\n\nAnd the best part is, the wind can change all the time.

Basically , it 's how dense the air is in a particular area . This is affected by what 's in the air ( humidity and pollutants definitely ) , but even more so by the temperature . As the temperature increases , the molecules in air vibrate and need more space , so they spread out more . So when an area is really hot , the air pressure pushes anything that 's dense ( say , clouds ) further away into low pressure ( lower temperature ) areas . Since it 's air moving , it 's wind . Air pressure can do this at varying elevations ( how high in the atmosphere the area is ) and places spread over the actual earth . The spin of the earth also has an effect , but it 's not something you would notice in just your local area . The effect the earth 's spin has is mostly at a global level , creating the [ Westerly Winds ] ( URL_0 ) . Since temperature has an effect on the winds , you can see where big spans of ocean or mountains can mess with the pattern too . If two cross breezes ( winds going in different directions ) are just right and form in seasons of specific temperature patterns , they can cause hurricanes and cyclones on a large scale or tornadoes and dust devils on a smaller scale .", "Wind is air that has someplace else to be . It happens because there is too much air in one place and not enough in another . This is LI5 after all .", "I remember being five and being confused about The Wind . I knew it was made by cars . You do n't even have to be inside a moving car to feel the wind that spews out of them . For awhile I was sure that wind came out of the clothesline poles in the back yard ( they make a weird whistling sound . ) Obviously it was coming out of the ground , then going up all the clothesline poles in the neighborhood , then spewing out of the T - shaped pipe ends . Thus the \" aolian notes . \" Hmmm , on second thought it might have been my father that told me about this when I asked where wind comes from . Anyway , back when I was five , my main error was thinking that air was nothing . We all walk around in empty space . Obviously ! Wave your hand around ... there 's nothing there . It certainly is n't like being underwater . WRONG . Spending life immersed in the atmosphere is almost exactly like being under water . Air is n't heavy like water of course ( air is only a couple of KG per cubic meter . ) But think : you can not feel the weight of water while swimming deep in the pool . So if air was a heavy fluid , we 'd never know this . AND FISH DON'T KNOW THEY'RE WET . ( Probably fish think they have antigravity super powers . I would . ) One way to tell that heavy air exists would be to open an umbrella and then wiggle it in and out , then close it up and wiggle it again . While open , it feels VERY heavy . That 's the extra mass , the heavy blob of air that it has to move . So my 5yr old self needed to know : we 're living under invisible water , but we do n't know it . But this type of water is n't very heavy . When the water starts moving across the landscape ... that 's what wind is ! Clouds of dust are really colored air : dust clouds are just like dumping some dye or dirt into clear water . The 5yr old inside me then realizes that wind must always blow in circles . If air is leaving this place , more air has to come in and fill the space . It 's like stirring the water in a bucket : no holes open up in the liquid . There must be giant rings of moving air sitting out there . This layer of thick heavy air on the earth , it could move faster and faster until the flow started scraping all the houses and trees off of the ground , like a fast river , or a snow avalanche which was totally invisible . Then I want to make a giant bubble with no air inside , and use it to go upwards instead of just using a balloon ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 316.0}

The social stigma against sex is entirely and completely a product of fundamentalist religion over the centuries .", "From a starting point , I 'd say NO , there 's no direct , logical benefit to being puritanical from an evolutionary point of view . My personal understanding is that behavior constrictions rise from how societies tend to control activities based on religious beliefs , traditions with ancient origins and/or ( usually ) rudimentary understandings of reality , not to mention other possible reasons like power dynamics and economic forces , most of them interconnected in a way or another . Think about it as starting as a raw moral code that prevents self destruction through murder and crazy violence and slowly changes and grows to encompass several different aspects of life . Societies develop various forms of limiting and controlling sex precisely because it 's such an important aspect of human life , not unlike there are / used to be regulations on what foods you could eat and when and where you should sleep . Here 's a modern day example : [ On Shabbat , according to Jewish law , there 's a list of 39 types of work that you 're not allowed to do . Over the years , these types of work have been interpreted by different rabbis as technology and lifestyle changed . The end result is that * * you 're not allowed to drive , use the phone , turn on the lights , cook food , or even tear off a piece of toilet paper to wipe your ass**](http://www . URL_0 /article_20923_5 - bizarre - realities - life - at - edge - gaza.html ) - from the humoristic URL_0 Think about it : if you control sex , you control the birth rates of the population , the possible economic and political gains obtained from pre - arranged marriages and even the people 's general happiness . This already presents a superficial analysis of societal regulation of behavior and the forces and causes behind them . [ This website in particular ] ( URL_3 ) is very useful with its compilations of theories and the many different observations and summaries it offers , if anyone 's interested in learning more . One of the possible explanations for the logic behind making certain activities taboo or , at least , restricting them , comes from the understandings of social structure by people like [ Radcliffe - Brown ] ( URL_2 ) . For him , in a simplified view , practices and beliefs in societies always serve certain functions , contributing in a certain way to the success of society . Say you are in a certain technological step and do n't understand the intricacies of pregnancy . Your wife keeps having miscarriages and no one knows why , except for the local religious figure , who has an explanation related to your religion and/or lifestyle ( maybe you did n't sacrifice enough animals ? did n't pray after having sex ? did something the rest of the population is n't used to and , therefore , finds strange ? ) . The point is , people start believing in the religious figure 's instructions , maybe because they know somebody who knows somebody who was healed when they followed all instructions or maybe because everybody 's been following their instructions for centuries already , so why should they stop ? * * TL;DR * * Sex is a very intimate and almost mandatory activity for humans , making it so that it can be done in a multitude of ways and some people might never learn about them , thus allowing for some aspects of it to be found strange or even straight up repulsive ( think homosexuality for people that spent their entire lives thinking about heterosexuality not only as the norm , but as the only logical choice ) . Combine that with the rise of social and religious constructions that mix legitimate spiritual concepts with desire for power and you 've got a subject that is very easy to control and can be very lucrative/ influential . Thus , the answer : no , puritanism does n't usually rise from objectives that favor the continuation of the species , it 's a social construction , although that could mean there 's a psychological * motion * behind it , but not strictly a benefit ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 315.6666666666667}

Houses cost a lot of money -- more than most people could ever afford to just save up and pay cash . So most of the time , somebody borrows all that money from a bank so they can live in the house and pays the bank every month over 30 years or so plus interest . The bank wants to be sure it 's going to get its money back , so they ask for a lot of paperwork from the person asking for a loan so they can prove they have a good job , make enough money , and are responsible enough to pay their bills on time and will take care of the house . But eventually , things started to fall apart . The bank you got a loan from did n't really want to wait 30 years to get their money back , so they sold your loan to somebody else . Your bill still has your bank 's logo on it , they still handle the paperwork , but your monthly payments are now going to somebody else . After a while , this meant that banks were n't as careful when lending money as they used to be -- if you ca n't make your house payments , it 's not their problem anymore . They make their money off of you in the beginning , and sell off the loan . You 're someone else 's problem now . So it gets easier and easier to get a mortgage . People go nuts , buying houses left and right . People start to make piles of money , selling a house they bought for $ 100,000 five years ago to somebody for $ 200,000 . And then they go buy another house and figure some new paint and a bit of yardwork will make them even more money . Heck ! Let 's buy two houses ! House prices keep going up up up up up . Banks are n't just selling mortgages to other institutions now , they 're making deals on top of them too , selling \" insurance \" to other big bankers in case somebody stops paying their bills . Eventually , people could n't pay their bills , and the whole mess came tumbling down . Banks failed , others could n't afford to lend any more money so other businesses had to shut down because they could n't get loans any more . So people lose their jobs , and now even more people ca n't pay their bills . Many of these people are stuck in houses they \" bought \" for $ 300,000 but it was never really worth more than $ 100,000 . House prices go down , down , down . And now that so many people are broke , they ca n't afford to buy toys and gadgets and cars like they used to . . . so the companies making those things start to go under or have to shrink and cut more jobs . . . which makes more people broke and unable to afford stuff . . . so more jobs cut . . . on and on and on . That 's where we are right now .", "Right now we are in a \" liquidity trap \" which means that no matter what policies the government tries , it is almost impossible for them to increase demand ( economic activity ) . Basically what happened when the banks were bailed out is that they did n't want to use the money the government gave them to give out loans ( which is one of the essential functions of a bank ) , which means that new small businesses , home , and student loans became much harder to come by , thereby restricting economic activity . At the same time , corporations still have to post profits in order to please shareholders , and when the economy is doing badly , the easiest way to make money is to cut workers and make the remaining ones do more ( as opposed to selling more products and making more revenue ) . This means that unemployment rose and the people that were previously spending money at businesses suddenly have no money so household consumption decreases . That 's a very basic picture of some of the things that are going on right now .", "> Banks extended loans so people could buy houses they could not afford . Several banks did not care how much they loaned . People could not make payments , banks lost lots of money on bad loans when people defaulted . Banks needed bailout to cover the loss .

Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *pat pat* Let me tell you something really important. Cancer is a very bad thing that can make your body sick. It's like a monster that tries to eat away at your healthy cells, and it can be really hard to stop it. Cancer can be caused by many things, like genetics, viruses, or things you might breathe in or eat. But here's the thing: your body is super smart and works really hard to protect itself, but sometimes the monster cancer can be too strong and it can make your body sick.\n\nNow, donating to a cause can be really helpful! *excited smile* When you donate money or time to help people with cancer, you're giving them the tools they need to fight back against the monster. It's like giving them a superpower to make their body stronger and help it beat the cancer. There are lots of ways to donate, like giving money to a hospital or organization that helps people with cancer, or even just being a really good friend and listener to someone who has cancer.\n\nIt's important to remember that cancer is a really hard thing to cure, but with the help of doctors and scientists, and with the help of people who care and donate, we can make it easier for people to fight back against the monster.

You are the Red team , the team and base , as a whole is your body . You 're churning through life when occasionally a Blue team soldier will rocket into your base , blasting away at your team . This may make you feel a little sick and dirty with a silly rocket man in your base , but eventually your Demo man will blast the smithereens out of him and you 'll be back to 100 % . Other times , after that hearty mexican meal , you feel a Pyro coming in and setting fire to your teleporers and everything , giving you massive heart burn . No worries , your Heavy [ bodys immune system ] will obliterate that guy slowly and you 'll be back up in no time . Cancer though , is like that scumbag spy . That spy who poses as your Engineer , looking like its about to repair your turrets , your teleporters , your dispensers , only to sap them and disable them . Cancer in a way is your own cells [ teammates ] sabotaging your base [ players , turrets , etc ] . Just like how its annoying as fuck to find a hidden Spy , its annoying as hell to eliminate Cancer cells . But you say , \" Pyros just go around flaming everything till we kill the spies , ca n't we do that ? \" Well just imagine friendly fire is on instead . You 'd be burning up every ally in your base ! That 's what happens with a lot of cancer treatments . It 's hard to differentiate the cancer cells from the good ones using drugs and so forth . Sometimes you have to risk killing good cells to get the bad ones . Scumbag spies are Cancer . They make you weaker , sometimes shutting down vital organs [ stealing your flag ] or making you so weak even a silly Scout with a baseball bat [ the common cold ] can come make your life a living hell . In a hellacious TF2 world , this would also include your safe room doors not opening , teleporters warping you 50 feet in the air , or into rocks and walls , or your own turrets firing on your teammates . Why is it important to donate to cancer ? So we can rid the world of spies ( I mean cancer ) in a quick , surgical , and less life threatening manner then resorting to lighting a fire under all of your allies ( you crazy pyros ) . PS . Do n't ask me how hats are factored in , I have n't thought that far . EDIT - KhaiNguyen presents a good point in that since the Spy is originally from an opposing team [ not your body ] this is not necessarily a 100 % accurate analogy [ and overall is a good way to describe a bit how HIV functions ] . Just a reminder , that Cancer originates FROM your body , not due to a foreign body causing havoc in your base . That point across , I believe the rest of the analogy works .", "Cancer cells tend to fool your immune system into thinking they are not bad , so they do n't get destroyed like a normal virus / bacterial infection . Cancer also spreads and hides out . So they may remove a tumor from your lung , think your all good , but then 3 years later it pops up in your liver with a vicious troll face . If a cancer spreads throughout more than one organ there is pretty much nothing they can do .. even if they remove it from both there is no way they can be sure it is n't somewhere else hiding out . Usually they will use chemo in these cases to poison your whole body ... kind of like saying \" we do n't know where the enemy is hiding , but we know it 's on that island .... nuke it \" . A tumor it not hard to cure , radiation and surgery will pretty easily take care of it . So it 's not that we do n't know how to beat cancer , it 's just that it 's a very evasive , yet aggressive disease . We need better ways to pinpoint it in the body and destroy it completely . They are trying to find ways to get the human body to mark cancer cells as bad so your own immune system will destroy it .", "Its helpful to read this comic : URL_1 and also check out this thread : URL_0"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 297.6666666666667}

They were just simple creatures that didn't have brains as big and smart as ours! *exaggerated gesture*\n\nBut over time, things started to change.

For example wolf who was able to bark when danger occured saved its pack members thus increasing it own chance of survival . Wolfs who did n't react / understand to react to danger more likely perished . I think love is more primitive thing . It is just feeling that one should mate with another one .", "Certain animals reproductive strategy require parental cooperation . Humans call both the urge to create a relationship , and the urge to maintain relationships , \" love \" . All of our emotions are essentially simply our way of perceiving instinctual urges , or at least urges that are strong enough for us to notice them . edit : Animals that do not form mating bonds have different chemical receptors . The hormones that correspond to lust / love would have no effect on animals that do n't bond . Those hormones are related to pleasure / reward . So , for instance , if a prairie vole ( which forms bonds ) * either * mates or has the hormones injected , they will bond . A montane vole ( which does not bond ) could mate , and it does n't do anything . Inject the hormones that a prairie vole produces from mating , and it has no effect . They simply will not form bonds . Presumably , this bonding process is pleasurable , since the hormones are essentially providing a reward .", "[ Affective neuroscience ] ( URL_1 ) is a very interesting area of study which examines \" the study of the neural mechanisms of emotion . This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . \" It also examines how our own neural mechanisms are mirrored in animals ( and especially mammals ) because of shared ancestry . The study of motion is definitely a very active area of science that permeates many different fields - evolutionary biology , animal behaviour , human behaviour , animal communication , human communication , origin of communication , psychology , psychiatry , neurobiology ... each look at different questions concerning emotions . In ELI5 words this means that animals are certainly capable of feeling emotions because the neural mechanisms that produce emotions are conserved through evolution , and are similar to the neural mechanisms that produce emotions in ourselves . All mammals , being related through common ancestry , have even more similar and conserved mechanisms - humans are of course mammals too ! But a few things to note : 1 . The way animals express a particular emotion may differ from the way humans express that emotion . For example , humans often smile to exhibit happiness . But for the rest of the primate order smiling is either a signal of submissiveness or fear . This does not mean that other primates are incapable of feeling happiness , but that they very likely express it in different ways from ourselves . We also have to be very mindful that other animals , even cognitively complex ones , may be physically constrained and incapable of complex facial expressions . For example , we know dolphins are capable of a lot of complex cognitive tasks , they are able to identify themselves in the mirror and they may even have names for one another ... but they do n't have the facial musculature to make the expressions that are , well , as expressive as ours . Their emotions may not even be obvious for this reason , but that does n't mean they do n't exist . 2 . Humans like to make emotions poetic , like love . But love is simply a kind of attachment emotion . Humans become attached to each other and objects , sometimes to the point of obsession . Animals also become attached to each other . Mothers and their infants , bonding pairs of adults ... all forms of attachment exhibited in the animal kingdom . Again if you were interested in studying * love * , as a scientist you would actually study * attachment * . I recommend the book [ affective neuroscience : the foundations of human and animal emotions ] ( URL_2 ) . It can be rather technical , but it is very good read . In any case , if we want to objectively study emotion and their origins , we sort of need to take the \" humanity \" out of emotions and look at them in a more universal way . Edit : For something a little more directed towards the layman , [ the moral lives of animals ] ( URL_0 ) is a very good read , as is [ age of empathy ] ( URL_3 ) ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 304.6666666666667}

But, just like how some superheroes have enemies, some people don't like vaccines. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of understanding: Some people might not know much about vaccines or how they work. They might hear rumors or misinformation about them and get scared. It's like they're afraid of the bad guys, but they don't know how to stop them.\n2. Fear of side effects: Everyone gets a little worried when they hear about side effects, but most vaccine side effects are like a mild case of the sniffles. They're nothing serious! *nods* Some people might be worried that their kids will get sick from the vaccine, but it's much safer than getting sick from the actual disease. It's like comparing a tiny bump on the head to a massive boo-boo that could keep you home from school!\n3.

People also are scared of the big words like Ammonium sulfate , Formaldehyde , and Mercury which are part of vaccines . They are also siting the increase in autism diagnoses . Keyword : increase in diagnoses . This is caused by a lot of things such as the fact that we are more aware of the disorder ( and it 's symptoms ) and over diagnosing . This does not mean that autism is suddenly everywhere . It means we are more aware of what was already there . That being said , there * might * be something that is increasing autism rates , but we ca n't be sure of it one way or another . What we * can * be sure of is that it is n't vaccines . The things that * are * increasing are deaths and cases of * * very * * preventable diseases . Edit , found the video : Let 's assume that vaccines * do * cause autism .

A lot of people panicked . Mercury was removed from vaccines . Autism rates continued to go up , clearly no link . Doc who published study was found to have written study with fake data because he had invested in company that made vaccines with no mercury . He ended up getting into a lot of trouble and the medical paper was retracted . He permanently lost his license to practice medicine . 2 ) After reason # 1 was found to be false , people came up with a different reason : giving a kid all these germs at one time is scary , it 's far more vaccinations than what people used to get , and that just sounds like it could be bad , overwhelm the immune system and make you sick ( even though there 's no evidence that this is happening ) . Some of the people who use this argument are n't completely against vaccines , they just want to have a different vaccination schedule , with a vaccination against one disease at a time , and perhaps when the children are a bit older . A problem with that argument is that when there are lots of different vaccinations to get , with each involving a different doctor 's appointment , people might not go to get all of the vaccinations they 're supposed to , at the time they 're supposed to . 3 ) sometimes health problems happen around the same time as a vaccination . These are problems that show no pattern -- one person gets one disease , another person gets another disease . So there 's no evidence that the vaccine causes the problem , since all kinds of different problems just happen to people every day for no clear reason . But this scares people , and there are always people out there who say that so - and - so was healthy before the vaccine , and sick afterwards , so it must have been the vaccine . Because of this , some people believe vaccines are bad .", "There are valid reasons not to vaccinate certain individuals , they may be immuno - compromized or allergic to one of the ingredients in the vaccine . These individuals rely on other people to get vaccinated so that they are protected from the disease through [ herd immunity ] ( URL_0 ) . Individuals who are against vaccinations for reasons other than medically valid reasons are called anti - vaccers . These individuals put their children at risk because they are more likely to get a preventable disease , and spread it to other unvaccinated children who have valid reasons for not getting vaccinated . One of the bigger arguments that anti - vaccers like to make is that vaccines cause autism . Only there is no research that links incidence of [ vaccination to autism ] ( URL_2 ) .

) 1 . Get a picture of a large event where you can see for a long distance within the frame of the picture . See how in the picture you posted you can see many cars close up and also many cars far away ? That 's a good picture to start with ! 2 . Without going into too much technical detail , using a photo editor program you blur just the top and bottom of the picture using a gradient . This means that the top and bottom of the picture will be most blurry and as you get to the center the picture gets less blurry . Congratulations , you just made a tilt - shift picture ! Now , why does it make things look miniature ? Well , this has to do with how your eyes look at small objects . Let 's do a little experiment . Get three little toys and put them on your desk , so that one toy is in front , one toy is in back about 6 inches away , and the last toy is even further back , about another 6 inches away . Now get down towards desk level and close one eye and focus the other eye on the middle toy . You should notice that when you 're focusing on the middle toy the toy in front and the toy in back are blurry . This is because the way your eyes and most camera lenses work , when you 're looking at things relatively close to you ( less than about 1 - 3 feet away ) , the lens in your eye that helps you focus can only focus on a narrow strip at the distance you are focusing . So when you are focusing on the middle toy , only the things that are that toy 's distance away from your eye will be in focus , and everything else in front of and behind the toy will be blurry . This is called * * narrow depth of field * * , meaning that when you are focusing on something close to you , you can only focus on a * * narrow * * strip at the certain * * depth * * ( aka distance from your eye ) of the object you 're looking at in your * * field * * of view . So how does this tie into tilt - shift pictures ? Well basically all these pictures are just mimicking what your eye does when it is looking at small objects close up . The cars closest to the camera ( the ones at the bottom of the picture ) , and the cars farthest from the camera ( the ones at the top of the picture ) , are made blurry because they are in front of or behind the depth at which the camera is \" focusing \" ( remember in real life that the camera took a picture of real , life - sized objects from very far away so it was basically able to focus on everything all at once ) . But , once you treat the picture with the blurring effects , then your brain perceives the picture as if it was taken by a camera up close to toy - sized objects ! I hope that explanation helped !", "First , you take a photo of something , as if you were looking down upon it at 45 degree angle . So the angle already sets it up like it were one a table top and waiste height . Then you zoom in a little bit , to aleviete the effect of perspective , to make it look more like a 2d isometric video game for the SNES or Genesis . Then to photoshop you go ! In photoshop . You jack up the constrast and the primary colours , to make it looke as if it were vibrantly hand painted . Last thing is that you apply degrees of blur to things closer and further away from whatever is in the middle of the shot . This makes it looks like your picture had a very very narrow field of depth , like a macro photo of a model from a few feet away . Voila ! Experiment . Hardest part is getting the right angle , of the right things . Try bridges and parkades .", "You make the top and bottom of the picture fuzzy because that 's how people see things when they 're really close . So the big things in the picture end up looking really small because you think you 're looking at something close to you ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 319.6666666666667}

Let me try and explain ... Let 's imagine that the world is a massive playground and each country is a gang , led by a particular kid . Now , one of these gangs is called Libya and it 's run by a guy called Gaddafi who is a little eccentric to say the least . He began slapping about some of the kids in his gang and so a bunch of other kids said that he should stop it . He did n't , so the leaders of the French and British gangs asked the biggest kid in the playground , the US , if they would help them stop him . Obama , the head of the US gang , easn't entirely into this but went along in a somewhat half hearted manner ( possibly because he was n't entirely sure of the the UK and French motives ... they might want to do it for the right reasons , but it might also be because they were getting unpopular at home and nothing cheers up a gang like winning a war ) . Libya is a long way from the gangs who wanted to stop Gaddafi so all they could really do was throw stones at him but on the upside , Gaddafi is so eccentric that he does n't really have many friends and the part of the playground that he lives in is n't very important to any of the other gangs . As a consequence , people could carry on throwing stones at him without anyone getting too concerned . Syria , on the other hand is a different kettle of fish . For one , their leader Assad is certainly a nasty man , but he 's not crazy like Gaddafi . As a result , he does have friends like Iran and aquaintances like Russia . Not only that , but he lives in a really sensitive part of the playground that 's inhabitted by some pretty odd characters . To his south is Israel who are very twitchy and have atomic weapons . They 've had fights with Syria before ( actually , they 've had fights with most of that part of the playground ) and those fights have a nasty habbit of getting out of hand . Further to the east is Iran who are very chummy with Syria and have a lot of power in that neck of the woods . For one , they have a massive influence on what happens in Iraq and there also happens to be a great deal of US troops still in Iraq . They also have the ability to make it difficult for people to get oil and can make other gangs do their bidding . In short , that bit of the playground is a mess and bombing Syria would most likely kick off something far bigger and dangerous . Not only that , but the Syrians are quite handy in a scrap and it would n't be as easy as throwing rocks at Gaddafi . Now , you are right , none of this is very fair because Assad is basically getting away with stuff that Gaddafi got in trouble for . But , my little Realpolitican , we sometimes have to think about whether doing the right thing may end up causing other things to go wrong . In this case , it 's almost certaion that if you did do the ' right ' thing , pretty much everything would go ' wrong ' .", "Well .... there are a few reasons : * There is no oil * The protestor were n't able to get a critical mass in Damascus and Aleppo * There is no unified opposition able to rule the contry in a post Assad Scénario * Religious and Ethnic division makes the region a ticking bomb * The upper society ( or \" Bourgeoisie \" ) always critical in such revolution is still supporting their president * Libya cruisade was and is a total failure * Military support from Russia ( last russian port in the mediteraneen is in Syria ) * Economical support from China * Syria absorbed many Iraqi refugees and many fear Chaos * Assad has still A LOT of support inside", "Well , NATO is already fighting at least two wars and most of their countries are encountering financial crisis . Then there is the fact that there is a lot of anti - war sentiment going around and that most of the the voters do n't care about the situation in Syria , not perceiving it to have a direct effect to their lives ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 314.3333333333333}

A table is basically like a spreadsheet , where you have columns and rows . Let 's say we have a table where we want to store information about people . What do we want to keep track of ? How about first name , last name , height and eye color . These four things we want to keep track of become our column names . Now we add a row to the table for each person we want to keep track of . The row about me might say ( Mmm , Vomit , 6'4 \" , green ) , meaning my first name is \" Mmm \" , my last name is \" Vomit \" , I 'm six feet four inches tall , and I have green hair . For another person it might say ( John , Smith , 5'8 \" , brown ) , meaning John Smith is five foot eight and has brown hair . This table may have information about lots of people . In order to get information out of the table , I have to tell the computer what information I 'm interested in . This is what SQL is for . I write an SQL query , which looks like this ... SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition ; Let 's say I want the row of every person with brown hair . My SQL query would look like this . SELECT * FROM people WHERE hairColor = ' brown ' ; This means \" Give me the rows from the table people where the column hairColor has the value brown . \" This then gives me the row for John Smith , along with anyone else with brown hair . When writing a program , we will used SQL queries that have a blank space in them . SELECT * FROM people WHERE hairColor = ' _ _ _ _ _ ' ; We then ask the person using the computer what should go in that blank space . If a person tells the computer to put \" blond \" in , the SQL query will look like this . SELECT * FROM people WHERE hairColor = ' blond ' ; We then get all the rows of people with blond hair . Well , now what happens if someone puts in your \" magic string \" ? You get a query that looks like this . SELECT * FROM people WHERE hairColor = ' ' or 1=1 - - ' ; Do you see what happened ? The single quote in your magic string is now the end of the value for matching hair color . This query is looking for any row where hair color is a space . That probably wo n't match any rows , but the magic string did something else , too . It added the word or . This means the query will return any row where either \" hairColor = ' ' \" is true or \" 1=1 \" is true . Since \" 1=1 \" is * always * true , this query will return every row in the table , which is not what the programmer meant for this query to do .

Some of these instructions are obtained from the url used in a web site . So a url such as this : search='golf balls ' , might get all the data related to golf balls from the database , and display the results on the webpage . That 's pretty cool . But what if I sneak in my own instructions instead . Well that 's what SQL injections do , they inject their own instructions into the url and these instructions are picked up by the database , so I could inject a instruction to delete all the data for example .", "Are you familiar with SQL syntax ?

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses*Suicide and assisted suicide are illegal in most countries because they are complex issues that involve many different perspectives and ethical considerations.\n\nYou know how there are rules in place to keep people safe, like not playing with fire or crossing the street without looking both ways? Well, laws about suicide and assisted suicide are like those rules, but for a different kind of safety.\n\nThe main reason why suicide and assisted suicide are illegal is because they can be very dangerous. Some people might feel like they have no other options and might not have the support they need to stay safe. It's like they might be in a really deep hole, and they might not know how to get out. By making these actions illegal, it can help keep people safe from harming themselves or others.\n\nAnother reason is that it's important to prioritize people's lives and well-being. Everyone has the right to live, and to have their life treated with respect and dignity. Assisting someone in ending their life can be seen as going against this right, and can be very hurtful for the people left behind.\n\nIt's also worth considering that there might be other options available for people who are in a lot of pain or are feeling like they have no other options.

Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide . The terminally ill patients meet with multiple doctors over a period of time and the doctor will give the patient a drug that they take on their own , so the doctor is n't directly involved with the death .", "If its for someone who is terminally ill and in immense pain I think it can be justified , but the bigger question that comes in to play is ' where do you draw the line ? ' - is it certain illnesses or time frames on how long someone has to live . Mental illness is also a major player , if someone is suffering major depression suicide can seem like a logical answer . However when people are in these suicidal states its often described as being almost drunk with the intention . For the ones that recover its often a blurred memory of what happened . On another angle even though you can say it 's their choice and blah blah , it fucking destroys families and leaves behind giant skeletons in the closets of the people that were the closest to them .", "This is not really something that can be explained like you 're five . This is n't something that can be explained at all . This is a long philosophical debate with no correct answer , and it depends on where * you * want to draw the line and what sort of morals * you * hold . But I guess the tl;Dr of it would be because those who consider suicide are often not in a healthy mental state to make logical and critical decisions . Suicidal individuals are often depressed . They can only see one side of things : the negative side . For example , if a suicidal individual sends you a text and you , for one reason or another , do n't reply , they wo n't take it the same way as a mentally healthy person . We might think \" well he might just be busy or he just does n't want to reply now , \" that is if we think about it at all . A suicidal individual , on the other hand , would probably think \" he does n't want to reply to me . He does n't like me . Nobody likes me . I 'm alone . \" Of course this is just an example , but it gives the general idea , I believe . I went on the verge of feeling suicidal during a phase of depression and I 've considered ending it all a few times . I even had the lyrics of my favorite song scribbled down on a piece of paper and I left it in my wallet just in case I do anything , so it can be taken as a suicide note . It 's a rather weird song . It can easily be interpreted as a celebration of life to give the listener hope , but it can just as easily be depressing and seem like a desperate cry for help . Anyway I 'm digressing . Now that I think about it , I do n't think I 've ever truly had it in me to end it all . I had only considered one side of things and I did n't think about the bigger picture . And when it came to it , had I really ended it all , it would 've been a stupid spur - of - the - moment sort of decision . If you 're talking about euthanasia , however , then that 's something completely different . I hope that explains it ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 313.3333333333333}

complicated because the US Senate has a lot of somewhat quirky procedural rules that let Senators manipulate the system if they understand them well enough ( or fall into traps ) . In this particular case , there 's a combination of two issues here : ( 1 ) the federal budget , and ( 2 ) Obama 's executive nominations . On ( 1 ) , the Senate had to approve a funding bill by Saturday night , otherwise the government would run out of money and have to shut down again . So the leader of the Senate Democrats , Harry Reid , and the leader of the Senate Republicans , Mitch McConnell , made a deal to vote on Friday to pass funding for enough stuff to tide the government over until next Wednesday . Then everyone would go home for the weekend , and come back on Monday and finish passing the \" full \" funding bill . HOWEVER , under Senate rules , you have to wait a certain number of hours before voting on a bill , unless EVERYONE agrees to waive the rule . Since the Friday tide - us - over bill was a new thing , Reid and McConnell needed everyone on board so that they could pass it and go home . That 's where Cruz got involved . He basically said , \" Reid , McConnell , you agreed that on Monday we can pass this symbolic thing saying Obama 's an unconstitutional tyrant Kenyan Muslim socialist , or whatever , but that 's not good enough - we have to do it NOW . \" So he and Mike Lee refused to go along with waiving the time requirement . So that meant that everyone had to stick around until late in the night Friday / early Saturday morning to finish the budget thing . And that 's where item ( 2 ) comes into it . That extra time that all the Senators were sitting around gave Harry Reid the chance to keep the ball rolling on Obama 's nominations that have been stalled . Because he was able to move 24 of the nominees to the next procedural step , that means the can get voted on earlier next week . If they HADN'T moved that step forward on Friday night / Saturday morning , they would have had to do it on Monday , which means that the next step would have come at the end of next week , instead of the beginning / middle . And if they came at the end of next week , there 's a much better chance that a lot of Senators would be gone home for Christmas , and when they come back next year the Republicans will be in charge and they probably wo n't get passed . So basically , Ted Cruz pitching a meaningless hissy fit made it a lot more likely that a bunch of Obama nominees will get confirmed . Bravo , Ted .", "Not quite sure what the nominations were for , but they were supposed to vote on the Cromnibus spending bill on Monday . Cruz pushed to have the vote take place on Sunday , instead . The bill passed with bipartisan support . Cruz also raised a vote to block Obama 's executive orders on immigration . His plan , according to the article , was to have this vote on Sunday because he figured many democrats would be home with their families during the weekend , thereby leaving mostly congressmen who opposed the orders . However , the vote failed , and instead 20 of Obama 's nominations ( concerning the immigration reform ? ) were approved . This was the opposite of what Cruz wanted . The article then speculates that had Cruz waited until Monday , more democrats would have been home with their families and not able to vote , meaning the vote against the executive order would have succeeded . But remember , that 's from URL_0 , which is a very bias source of information . They might be writing the article to make Cruz look worse than normal ( as if he does n't do a good enough job of that himself )", "It 's important to note that none of the nominations were actually approved on Saturday . The votes allowed Sen. Reid to file a cloture motion on each nomination . The purpose of a cloture motion is to end debate and force a vote . \" Paves the way \" At a future date , the cloture motion is voted upon and if agreed to , there is a subsequent vote on the actual nomination ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 311.0}

It's like when you're playing with your friends and you have to take turns with the toys.

Timberlake . Where everyone uses time as currency as well as to live on , in order or others to live forever , people have to die .", "Probably not . While everybody has the legal freedom to be successful , not everybody has the means . Illness , substance addiction , poverty , poor education , family / relationship problems , homelessness , prejudice , being screwed by ' the man ' , and a whole host of other things are obstacles to success for many people . This is one of the main differences in worldview between right - wing ' libertarians ' and supporters of a social welfare system - the right wingers believe that generally , people are responsible for their own success or failure , but supporters of a social welfare system believe that sometimes people are screwed over by circumstances beyond their control . As you can probably tell from this answer , I 'm in favour of social welfare , but then again I 'm from Europe where pretty much everyone supports this kind of system . Just be aware that you 're not going to get unbiased answers in this thread !", "No , not by the common understanding of prosperity , even though , technically we are almost all pretty prosperous historically . The issue is that people define prosperity relatively , \" I 'm wealthier than average \" is comprehensible , \" I 'm wealthy \" is not since we then wonder what the criteria of being wealthy are . Look at it this way , most people , even people who are economically below average , have a much higher quality of life than wealthy people did living a thousand years ago . Therefore they are more \" prosperous \" than these wealthy people . And certainly , if you are more prosperous than a wealthy person , you must yourself be prosperous . But no one considers these people to be prosperous , because as human beings we must think of things relatively , we must have some frame of reference . Even for the same person we can modify whether or not they are prosperous based on whom we are comparing them to at a given moment . We can say someone is poor , or unprosperous when we are thinking in our mind of the United States but if someone were to say , \" yes but what about compared to the rest of the world \" , we would think about Africa and India and such and perhaps say that yes this person is prosperous . Anyway , in the end , prosperity basically means quality of life and we measure quality of life relatively . But let 's take some country smaller than the U.S. , let 's go back to ancient Greece and form our own small city - state of 1,000 people . imagine that we are excellent at warcraft and can go and take the land and goods of many of the small nations surrounding us ; we divide these spoils up and give each family their fair share . Then , all our people could considered prosperous , because we would be a small nation and in close proximity to others who are less . But the United States is , I think too big , or rather it is too proportionately big compared to the total population . We make up such a big portion of the world , and occupy a fairly isolated position , surrounded as we are by oceans and few nations , that the \" pool of people \" to whom we compare a given person will always be comprised mostly of U.S. citizens . So while it is possible , perhaps in some socialist country which has discovered amazing natural resource , for all the citizens in a small European country to be \" prosperous \" , it is only because the first inclination is to take a larger pool , where the citizens of this country make up less than half of the total . For the pool of the United States , U.S. citizens will most likely be more than half , therefore all of them can not be above average , nor even all average or above . * * TLDR : The only way we can think about prosperity is on a relative scale , we must compare our citizens to others . And the U.S. is too proportionally big and too isolated to every have a pool of comparison big enough , where we do n't have to compare our own citizens to other citizens . * *"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 310.0}

And have you seen how it looks when it catches the light? 😍 It's like a little piece of magic! ✨\n\nBut, you might ask, why is it that humans keep going back to something that's just pretty to look at? 🤔 Well, sometimes things in life are more important than being practical. Gold has become a symbol of value and wealth because it's rare and hard to find. It's kind of like a special treasure that only a few people have! 🏵️ And, just like how you might like to collect special things like stickers or toys, some people like to collect gold because it's so

Gold is pretty shiny and it shines the colour of the sun . Yellow . There 's lots of old religions that worship the sun or sun gods and generally the sun gets a lot of respect for making plants grow . It 's a very malleable metal , which makes it great for jewelry . It 's rare and therefore expensive . It 's expensive , so it becomes a symbol of wealth or a symbol of no expense being spared . It 's inert , so it sticks around for ages . It 's now vital to the electronics industry , so there will always be demand . It 's value does n't fluctuate anywhere near as much as money , so it makes a good commodity to buy when money looks weak .", "Obligatory \" Economist here \" : Aesthetic values aside * * it had plenty of practical use * * . It was the practical use that stemmed from physical properties of gold that led to any religious connotations not the other way around . Without the practical applications of gold it could never evolve into money . If it was just holy then paying with it would be sacrilege . Gold does n't corrode as other metals including silver or copper so it 's perfect for important jewellery , coinage , ornamentation - all of which had plenty of significance most notably as identifying features . Rings , heraldry , stamped coins and seals - all that served the same role as photographs , signatures etc in medieval times and before . Coins were initially stamped to certify the quality of the metal in the coin . It was the equivalent of a signed bank note or a credit card in the days when most of trade was barter . Because of that other properties - it was used very early on in medicine even in ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia . Because it does n't have harmful effects on the human body while not becoming tarnished ( see silver ) people thought that it was a better , holy element . * * Teeth * * . Did you forget how easy it was for people back then to loose teeth ? Gold was the only metal which could be placed in your mouth and last for life while looking as new . It is also extremely malleable and ductible which means that a simple technology can process gold with ease to produce all those important and valuable items . Gold is easier to process than iron which is why it was common in the Bronze Age already . You can press or hammer it into thin foil or make gold thread or thin rods . You can make coins , cups , utensils , pins , needles and obviously teeth . Gold is a very heavy metal - almost twice as heavy as silver and three times as heavy as copper - which means that it 's harder to fake - which is important because only true , pure gold has desired chemical properties . It is also an element with a better crystalline structure so it is also - among other things - able to produce a clearer sound on its own . The famous golden \" ting \" . In a time when people had no clue what an element is this was a great way to ensure quality of material . Gold was the rare earth element of the ancient times . It was crucial for the ancient and medieval \" high - tech \" industries . * * That * * is why it is so valued throughout history . And it is precisely why it became money over time . You have to have something of high value first before you can pay with it . It is just now that we do n't have as much use for it ..... unless there 's a war which means that our sophisticated economy and technology stops being helpful and people have to make do with what they have . That 's why gold is so valued in primitive circumstances even in XXI century . When your computer goes down and your credit card expires and the government paper becomes worthless you can still heat up the gold earring and split it in smaller parts .", "Here are some of the traditional symbolic associations with gold : \" The sun ; illumination ; the self - luminous ; the quality of sacredness ; incorruptibility ; wisdom ; durability ; the equilibrium of all metallic properties ; nobility ; honour ; superiority ; wealth .

You could either use your own money to buy all the materials you need, or you could invite your friends to help you buy the factory together! If you invite your friends to help, you'll each own a tiny piece of the factory, and you'll all work together to make more toy cars. That's kind of like how the stock market works! 🚀\n\nNow, you might be wondering, why would people want to buy stocks?

The main difference between stocks and beanie babies is that you ca n't actually play with stocks , so you 're mostly hoping that you 'll be able to sell them for more money in the future . Like beanie babies , stock prices are affected by a few different things : * How good is it actually ? Does the beanie baby look really cute , is it in good shape ? Stocks for well - run companies that make lots of money by selling great products are like really cool beanie babies that are well taken care of . Other stocks are for companies that are like ugly , dirty or worn - out beanie babies , so people wo n't want to pay as much for them . * How common is it ? If a beanie baby is really easy to get , it wo n't be as expensive as if there are less of them around . In the same way , if a lot of people want a stock but there are limited shares , its price will go up . * What do the experts say ? Does the beanie baby have a label that says it 's really rare and nice ? People put labels like that on stocks too , and just like beanie baby labels they affect prices a lot more than you might think . * What fads or trends are going on right now ? If a certain beanie baby shows up in the news or has a role in a popular movie , it 'll suddenly be a lot cooler even though it 's the same beanie baby . Beanie baby prices also go up right before Christmas every year . Not all stock prices move like that , but a lot of them will move the same way from year to year . * What other toys are popular ? Sometimes no one wants to buy beanie babies because another really cool toy or video game is more popular for a while . Stocks have rival toys too , like bonds or commodities or foreign currencies .

The villagers , seeing that there were many monkeys around , went out to the forest and started catching them . The man bought thousands at $ 10 and as supply started to diminish , the villagers stopped their effort . He further announced that he would now buy at $ 20 . This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again . Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms . The offer increased to $ 25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey , let alone catch it ! The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $ 50 ! However , since he had to go to the city on some business , his assistant would now buy on behalf of him . In the absence of the man , the assistant told the villagers ; \" Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected . I will sell them to you at $ 35 and when the man returns from the city , you can sell them to him for $ 50 each . \" The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys . Then they never saw the man nor his assistant , only monkeys everywhere ! Now you have a better understanding of how the stock market works . EDIT : I did not come up with this myself .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow accurate are IQ tests and how useful are they ? I do n't understand whether they are an outdated tool or if they are useful in predicting things like success , failure , salary , violence / crime , etc . Help ! Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* I'm here to explain something really cool: IQ tests! 🤔\n\nIQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, and it's a number that shows how smart a person is. But, you know what? IQ tests aren't always super accurate. They can be a bit like a game where you're trying to guess how many sweets are in a jar. Sometimes you might get it right, but other times you might be off a bit. 🍭🤷‍♀️\n\nThat's because IQ tests only measure a small part of intelligence. There are lots of different kinds of intelligence, like being good at math, reading, or playing a sport. IQ tests usually focus on things like memory, problem-solving, and thinking fast. They don't measure things like creativity, kindness, or how well you make friends. 🤝🏼\n\nSo, while IQ tests can be helpful in some ways, they're not always the best tool to predict things like success, failure, salary, violence, or crime. It's kind of like how you might be really good at basketball, but not so great at reading. It's okay to be good at different things! 🏀📚\n\nAlso", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -0.06291339546442032}, {"text": "there", "logprob": 0.0},

"answers": ["Well , we can rule out the online \" IQ \" tests as shams , there is no point in believing them . As other in this thread have pointed out , you need to give a proctored IQ test if you want a reasonable estimate of your IQ . Now we come to the question of whether having a higher IQ gives a person a significant advantage over someone with a lower IQ . To answer this I 'm going to draw deeply on what I read in Malcolm Gladwell 's Outliers . He gave the example of a man , who is quite possibly the most intelligent man on the planet ( his IQ is 40 points over Einstein 's ) . This genius was a Bar Bouncer for most of his adult life , he now lives on a farm and works on physics theories but he does n't even have a Bachelors degree to his name . In the end , he did n't live up to his potential . Another good example that he gives is of the [ Genetic Studies of Genius ] ( URL_0 ) which is a study conducted over decades to track the children in the state of California back in the 1910s who gave a proctored IQ test and were deemed geniuses . After tracking these kids through most of their lives the study found that some of them became exceptional in their fields , but many of them went on to live mundane lives , not doing anything equivalent to what their IQ suggested they were capable of doing . So why was this , why were n't these kids who were the top 1 % of the IQ bracket not the leading lights of their fields ? It 's because humans are more complicated than that . Emotions , personality , attitudes , the willingness to work with others are just some of things you need to succeed in life . Additionally , just because someone has a higher IQ does not preclude him / her from mental illnesses . Additionally , Gladwell also points out that most jobs in our society just need us to be of average or just above average IQ ( around 115 - 120 ) this is enough to graduate from college and work in demanding jobs such as engineering , architecture , investment banking . Most of us actually fit into this bracket ( as someone described , its a bell curve ) . Beyond this bracket , additional IQ points wo nt make significant changes to your earning potential / career . IQ is relevant but only as one of many important attributes a person should have , willingness to work with others , a good attitude , good values , and the willingness to work very very hard are all part of this mix . You ca n't determine what a person is like , or might turn out like if you just look at one small part of what makes him who he is . tl;dr - Lots of people with high IQs did n't do well in life . Most people have sufficient IQ to handle most of the jobs that society has to offer . You ca n't understand a person just by his IQ , you need to look at his values , personality etc .", "It depends on the format . The online tests ? They 're useless . If you 're going to try to apply for a job and you 're \" smart \" ? Dumb it down ... they 're looking for a 90 - 110 IQ and if your'e too smart you 'll be flagged as \" not a fit \" If you really want to know your IQ ? You need a proctored test . Will it help you ? Nope . If you 're smart ? Great . That does n't pay the bills . If you 're really smart ? It will let you know you 're not crazy - just more intelligent than the usual suspects that piss you off daily .", "Not very and not much . They can not predict anything at all . There are idiots who made millions out of luck and smart people who live regular average lives . The same goes for every other aspect you mentioned . It might be a relevant marker to some extent . However it requires some form minimum understanding of language between the one testing and the one being tested . All tests require either vision , oral auditory skills ( with one of them being optional ) . They are subjective and not absolute ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 316.0}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nWhat is homeopathy ?

It's like a secret ingredient that helps make you feel better. 😊\n\nYou know how sometimes you might not feel so great, like when you have a boo-boo or a yucky tummy? Homeopathy is like a superpower that can help make those boo-boos and yuckies go away! 💪\n\nIt works by using really, really small amounts of special plants, minerals, or other things that can help your body feel better. Like, really small amounts! You might need to look really closely to find them in a homeopathy bottle. 🔍\n\nPeople who use homeopathy believe that it can help their body heal itself, kind of like how you might grow a new hair to replace a lost one. It's all about helping your body take care of itself in the best way it can. 🤝\n\nReddit is a really cool place where people share their thoughts and feelings about homeopathy, but everyone has their own opinions. Some people might think it's super helpful, while others might not be so sure.

conditions can be cures for those conditions . For example , if a certain herb causes nausea when eaten , a homeopath might believe that very tiny amounts of that herb can cure nausea . This belief has no basis in modern science , and in fact a typical homeopathic drug is so dilute that it contains literally no molecules of the original substance .", "Homeopathy is one of several forms of alternative medicine , this means that you can use homeopathic remedies instead of traditional medicine remedies . The former uses \" medicaments \" ( based on the [ * miasma theory * ] ( URL_0 ) and [ * water memory * ] ( URL_1 ) ) , I wo n't talk about that theory here . The remedies are often prepared by a \" homeopathic dilution \" . In this process the substance that homeopaths think will cure a disease is diluted with water or alcohol . Imagine you have , lets say , some vegetal dye ; you add 1 mL in 1 L of total solution , so , this stock solution has 0.001 % of dye . According to water memory , water has the capability to retain the qualities of the substance previously diluted in it , so , if you dilute this stock solution to one tenth , you will have 0.0001 % dye in your solution ( 1 mL in 10 L ) but the water will still have the qualities of the first solution . With this reasoning , if you re - dilute the second solution to one - tenth , you will have a solution with 0.00001 % dye ( 1 mL in 100 L ) and the same qualities of the stock solution . Going on with this reasoning , you can have a 0.00000001 % dye solution ( 1 mL in 1 000 000 L ) that will have the same qualities as the stock solution . Lets take this example to reality . Dilute 1 drop of dye in a glass of water . The water will turn into the colour of the dye . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . The water may be slightly dyed , but not too much . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . In this point you will certainly do n't see any dye at all . Take a drop of this solution and dilute in another glass of water . Would you drink this glass of water ? Would you be afraid to get your guts dyed ? Repeat the latter . How about now ? Is this solution still dyed ? Certainly , no . The big deal with homeopathic medicines is that they have the same results as placebos in clinical studies . That is , you compare a liquid homeopathic medicine vs. distilled water . If , statistically , the number of people cured with the homeopathic medicine are about the same as the number of people cured with the distilled water , homeopathic medicine does n't work . To add another layer of comparison , use a traditional medicament as well ; if this medicine outperforms the placebo it means it is really working as a medicine . To accomplish this results , you need a double blind administration of medicines ( neither the person giving the medicine and the person receiving it know which one of the three they are receiving , they only know they are giving / receiving a medicine for the disease ) . I did my best to give a not - too - opinionated answer but , as you may have noticed , homeopathy is a total scam based on pseudoscience . The fundamentals in which it is standing completely neglect our knowledge of very basic chemistry .", "Homeopathy is classified as a pseudoscience , like astrology . this is because no scientific study has ever shown a homeopathic remedy to be any more effective than a placebo . Basically , in homeopathy \" miasms \" make you sick . Certain substances are supposed to remedy those miasms , but you ca n't actually take that substance . Instead , you 're supposed to dilute that substance in a solution so many times that none of the original substance remains . Despite there being none of the substance in any scientific sense , the solution is now supposed to have special curative properties . Many , Many , Many official government organizations warn against using homeopathy as a treatment to any severe condition ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 298.0}

Profits though would n't be monetary but strategic . NATO would gain a country with a direct border with Russia and increase their bufferzone between Russia and the west , while Russia wants to maintain it 's soviet buffer with Europe . For Russia it 's also a matter of prestige to keep allies from the Old Soviet block . Now , there is a theory that was presented by an ex - Putin cabinet member which says Putin is trying to destroy the east via this conflict as a way to start talks with Ukraine in which they 'd agree to receive aid from Russia to rebuild the east in exchange for their loyalty and staying out of the EU and NATO . Thus keeping them as allies . That 's if we only count countries in the scenario . If we count private entities then obviously whenever you have two sides selling weapons to both camps then the weapons companies are the ones who profit . EDIT : Also I 'm not sure why you 're saying ' NATO and Russia are clearly losing ' . This is a chess game and the only real loser is Ukraine which is taking the blunt of the conflict .", "> Clearly the NATO and Russia are both losing in this current crisis . NATO is n't losing . Ukrainian crisis is the best thing to happen , for NATO , in a long time . Pretty much all NATO members ( except for the US ) were limiting their expenditures more and more year after year . The US was constantly trying to get other NATO - members to step up their involvement , but they all would keep declining . NATO was sliding into irrelevance . At the end , they were trying to position themselves as the protectors of the world from Iran ( for the lack of any other \" mission \" ) , but that was n't working out . They were still becoming less relevant with each passing day . And now , well , they are the saviors of the western world , once again . More relevant than ever . And since any entity fights for its existence above all other objectives ( which is just natural ) , it 's really safe to say that NATO ( as the organization ) is the greatest beneficiary of this whole situation . Russia is definitely losing . But Russia would be losing in either case . Years of problems / corruption / tensions compounding . No good exit strategy really exists . Europe is losing . Economically , this whole thing is really damaging . But it 's a matter of political principle . If they do n't step up , they 'll no longer be viewed as one super - entity . Instead , they would be de - facto divided back into separate countries . The only truly winning parties are US and China . For the US , it 's crucial to make sure Europe and Russia do n't get too comfy together , because then the dominance of the US would diminish . Which now , thanks to the Ukrainian situation , is no longer a possibility for another 10 - 20 - 30 years . US is still the only big dog in town for the foreseeable future , or at least until China steps up . And for China , Russia is now forced to deal with them on their terms . China can now dictate the terms of Russia 's \" turn to the east \" that was announced . Russia is backed into a corner , and China is the only alternative for Russia . Which is a great advantage for China . That 's globally . Locally , in Ukraine , it 's mostly various groups of oligarchs and field commanders that are trying to get bigger piece of the pie . Some are losing and some are winning .", "The person profiting the most from this crisis is obiously Vladimir Putin , since his approval rating has soared due to the crisis and Russians who were sick and tired of him have started standing behind someone who has led Russia to behaving like a superpower . That to many Russians is more important than how the country is heading towards a recession . However how people he will be if the crisis drags on and Russia 's economy continues to weaken will be left to be seen ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 303.0}

Like how the sun is bright and we can see it in the sky? *points up* Well, when light travels a really, really long way, like from a galaxy far, far away, it can start to slow down. It's like it's taking a nap on the journey, and when it wakes up, it's all \"Whoa, I'm so far away now! *giggles*\"\n\nThat's why we see some stars and galaxies that are really, really far away, but they look red instead of blue. It's like they're wearing a special red filter, and we can only see them with our telescopes. *excited*\n\nAstronomers call this special red color \"redshift.\" *nodding* It's like a magic spell that happens whenever light travels super far.

They 're a little odd , so the best thing they can think of is to have each of them hold one end , and have Bob run away from Chris while he is standing still . The two notice that the slinky stretches out when Bob does this . A bit later , they decide to have Bob run towards Chris ( who is still standing still ) . The slinky gets really tightly compressed and close together . You see , light is like that slinky . When Chris , or a planet , is moving away from us , the slinky , or light is stretched out . When Chris , or a planet , is moving towards us , the light is squished together . But what does that do to the light ? Well , [ here ] ( URL_0 ) is an image that might help . When light is * longer * , it 's to the left , and when it 's * shorter * , it 's to the right . [ Here ] ( URL_1 ) is another useful image , which also shows the \" slinky \" . So redshift just means that the \" slinky \" , which is light , is being stretched out . What does that tell us ? Think back to Chris and Bob . It means that the planet is moving away ! And if it was blue ( blueshift ) ? I leave that one to you .", "Everything that astronomers see in the sky is because of a wave that came from that object . Most of these waves are light , but astronomers also have infrared telescopes that can see waves that are n't visible to our eyes . Of the waves of light that we can see , the \" weakest \" are the ones that carry the color red , while the \" strongest \" ones are the ones that carry the color violet . Anything stronger than violet is ultra - violet and anything weaker than red is infrared . When a wave comes from an object moving AWAY from us , that wave appears to us to be weaker than it actually is . Since we think of red as weaker , we call this weakening of the wave \" redshifting \" . It 's very useful because it lets us know if an object is moving or not just by how its light looks . Similarly , is an object is moving towards us its light will appear to be stronger .", "it 's like the [ doppler effect ] ( URL_1 ) , but with [ light ] ( URL_2 ) . first , i 'll explain the doppler effect : when a police car is driving toward you , its siren seems to be higher pitched because it 's at a higher frequency . between each release of a sound wave from the police car , the car also \" chases \" the sound wave released , so that the next sound wave released is closer to the first than it would be if the car was standing still . note that if the sound does not just \" go faster \" ; the velocity of sound in a particular medium is finite . the same is true of light , although for a different reason ( i wo nt go into these reasons ) . however , if the officer fired a * bullet * while driving , the velocity of the car would be * added * to the velocity of the bullet . unlike sound , a bullet fired from a moving police car actually moves faster than a bullet fired from a stationary police car . when this same process occurs with light , it 's called \" blueshifting \" because the frequency of visible light is shifted more toward \" blue \" ( this only applies to visible light . see the [ light spectrum ] ( URL_0 ) for a better idea of what happens . radio waves are blueshifted toward microwaves , and ultraviolet light is blueshifted toward x - rays . ) the reverse effect occurs when the police car is driving away from you . the wave fronts of the sound wave are spaced farther apart ; the frequency is lower than normal . same thing with light : when a luminous body is moving away from a frame of reference , the light appears \" redder \" at the frame of reference . again refer to the [ light spectrum ] ( URL_0 )"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 288.6666666666667}

It's actually a lot like Christmas, but instead of focusing on presents and Santa Claus, Kwanzaa is all about celebrating family, community, and culture. *nodding*\n\nKwanzaa was created by a man named Maulana Karenga in the 1960s. He wanted to give African Americans a special time to come together and celebrate their heritage, after a lot of African Americans were leaving their culture behind when they came to America. *understanding nod*\n\nSo, during Kwanzaa, people gather with their families and friends to sing, dance, and play games. They also light a special candle every day, called a kinara, which has seven candles in a circle. Each candle stands for one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, called the Nguzo Saba. *excited gesture*\n\nThese principles are things like unity, self-determination, and cooperative economics. They're all about helping people work together and take care of each other, and celebrating the richness of African American culture. *nodding*\n\nIt's okay to not know a lot about Kwanzaa, because

of how I - or anyone else - views the holiday , Kwanzaa is an African - American celebration that is primarily observed in the southern states . It first came about in America about sixty years ago , in the heat of the black rights movement . It was created as a way for black Americans to celebrate the traditions true to their heritage while living in America . It was not made as a substitute for Christmas , though some choose to have it be so . It was created as a non - religious African - American celebration , to recognize the traditions that were carried over from Africa . Kwanzaa is now usually celebrated along side Christmas , and consists of home - made gifts , core values such as family and friends , and food .", "I celebrated Kwanzaa for a period of 5 - 6 years with my family when I was a child . My experience was very positive , and I 'm glad I celebrated it , as it gave me an interest in learning more about the various cultures / countries in Africa . Many black Americans celebrate Kwanzaa , but the majority do not . It probably would n't be a good idea to give your black friends / coworkers / in - laws Kwanzaa cards , unless you know for sure they celebrate it . Kwanzaa for my family was a time where we could get together with other like - minded people ( which often included non - black people who were interested in Kwanzaa ) who simply wished for alternatives during the holiday season . There was no Santa Claus , no Church , no Jesus , no people asking you to spend your hard - earned money on things you did n't need . We got together , ate good food , often learned something about West / East African cultures and history , and just had a good time being together . Kwanzaa varies for the people who celebrate it . Some see it as a political celebration , and there is a lot of posturing , while others enjoy the connection it brings with the community . My family celebrated Kwanzaa because it allowed us to connect with our ancestors in West Africa , even via blended / made - up traditions . The first year of Kwanzaa , my family celebrated all seven days , and gave presents to each other each day . The presents could not be bought ; that is , we had to give something of * ours * to other members of our family . It was a cool experience . We also went to local events in our ( mixed ) community . In the later years , we only went to local Kwanzaa events and eventually stopped . /u / HiterWasASexyMofo is wrong about many things concerning Kwanzaa . 1 . The reason why Swahili / Kiswahili was chosen as the language of Kwanzaa is because it is the language of the pan - African movement that started in East Africa ( where Swahili is a unifying language in the region ) . This is not exclusive to Kwanzaa , as many black - power movements and figures used Swahili in solidarity with those in [ East ] Africa . 2 . Kwanzaa does not further \" racial divisiveness . \" Kwanzaa began as a way to connect African Americans with the \" African \" part of their heritage , a heritage that many black people unfortunately saw as inherently negative or less - than . Further , non - black people are welcome in Kwanzaa celebrations , and can celebrate it with their non - black families if they wish . 3 . Kwanzaa was not invented \" by a US prisoner \" in the 60s . Karenga was convicted of assault in the early 1970s . This was after the creation of Kwanzaa . TL;DR : Light some red , black , and green candles , shout * harambe ! * a couple of times , and chow down on Kwanzaa cake : URL_0", "One thing that is n't being mentioned here is the reason why anyone wanted such an observance . Most people have cultural traditions that go back a long way , and its part of cultural heritage and identity . Many black Americans have lost that link to their ancestry , because some generations ago their ancestors were kidnapped into slavery . Stuff like Kwanzaa helps people like that to feel that they belong to part of a larger culture that has traditions and heritage ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 309.6666666666667}

Let me tell you a secret: some grown-ups don't always tell the truth on TV. Fox News is a TV channel that has been said to not be trustworthy by a lot of people, including some grown-ups like your mother and father. That means they might say things that aren't true or fair.\n\nYou know how you have to be honest and tell the truth in your own life? Well, some grown-ups don't always do that on TV. They might say things to make you think something is true, but it's actually not. It's kind of like if you said your favorite food was broccoli, but you really hate it. You wouldn't want to lie about something like that, and neither should grown-ups on TV.\n\nNow, it's important to remember that not all TV stations are the same. There are some that are really good at telling the truth and being fair, like ABC News or CBS News. But Fox News has been said to have some problems with telling the truth sometimes. It's okay to have different opinions, but it's important to be honest and fair when you're talking to people.\n\nSo, when you watch TV, you should always be thinking about whether what you're seeing is true or not.

This is not criticism of you , not at all , but when you can listen to Fox News and _ hear _ what they 're doing that people criticize , you will become far more able to make your own independent decision than like 85 - 90 percent of Americans - and it 's a skill that applies to all media outlets . Fox News ( and to a lesser but very real extent MSNBC ) are great places to practice this . Here 's an example : Say that Obama went to a United Nations conference and played a game of golf with David Cameron ( the conservative prime minister of the UK ) while the conference was out of session . These are the facts . _ how _ the facts are presented is mostly where people get upset about media slant . A middling pro - Obama headline ( like one might see on MSNBC ) might say , \" Obama reaches across the aisle to demonstrate goodwill to foreign conservative UK Prime Minister David Cameron \" a more extreme anti - Obama headline ( like one might see on Fox News ) might say , \" Obama leaves United Nations conference ; spends thousands of dollars to waste time with David Cameron instead of focusing on domestic problems \" Each of these are _ presuming something _ on the facts . For all we know , Obama and Cameron just both like golf . They may never have talked about politics at all , and the conference was out of session so there was little work to be done . However , the media slant invents a story _ that interprets the facts in a way that 's designed to gain viewership , not to report the story _ . They 're doing what tabloids do ; the difference is that we all generally know that tabloids are not real news , they 're entertainment . Fox is absolutely extreme about this : they often misrepresent facts , cherry - picking data they want to show , inferring motives on the people in the story , and so on . If you go to [ Your Logical Fallacy Is ] ( URL_3 ) and study up on all of the different logical fallacies , you 'll start to see them all the time when listening to _ any _ mainstream news outlet . Fox News is the prime example of this , so people focus on them , but you 'll hear these in MSNBC as well . I have no problem with this if people understood that they were watching entertainment ; for instance , watching The Daily Show , it 's clear that it 's an entertainment show whose premise is based on news items . Fox News _ represents itself as actual news _ , though , and enough people believe it , that [ studies have found that watching Fox News makes you less informed about the world than watching no news at all ] ( URL_1 ) . EDIT : I was remiss on my original statement for the link above , as others have pointed out , by not mentioning that exclusive viewers of MSNBC were , in this study , _ also _ less informed than the \" no news \" population . I was focusing on Fox News because they were the direct subject of the question , but they both do disservice to their viewers ' knowledge of what 's going on insofar as this study found . I thought I 'd add in some more information about the accuracy of news networks : I like [ PolitiFact ] ( URL_2 ) as an independent measure of the truthfulness of media statements for stuff like this . They have some meters to measure [ how well networks are doing in reporting facts ] ( URL_0 ) which are interesting with regards to this discussion", "[ They knowingly and intentionally lie and mislead incredibly often . ] ( URL_0 ) They are , functionally , the propaganda extension of the Republican party . ^Automoderator - enforced ^length ^requirements ^are ^a ^a ^horrible ^thing .", "whooo boy . Most popular US news channels are just trying to get viewers . Conservatives like the channel so Fox just give them what they want . They still say what happened they just add an interpretation to it that is .. just ... not what you would call .... um ... cause and effect are not concerns of Fox News ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 309.3333333333333}

Computer hardware can , in itself , be made to do certain mathematical operations just by the way it 's wired . For instance , this is what an [ adding circuit looks like . ] ( URL_0 ) It only adds together two bits ( so it can only do 0 + 0 , 0 + 1 , 1 + 0 , or 1 + 1 ) , but if you make a bunch of these circuits and string them together , eventually you can add very large numbers . Similar circuits can be built to subtract numbers . Another thing electronics can do is store numbers in memory , and load numbers from memory . Eventually , through combinations of these circuits , one big circuit , a processor , is made . The processor starts by loading a special number from memory . That number is the first command it executes- encoded into a number so that it can be stored- after that , the processor loads the next command and so on . In order to get those commands in place in the first place , other electronic devices were used that just set the memory one section at a time . There was no \" First OS \" , though , since operating systems slowly evolved out of this technology of storing commands in memory . At some point , a computer was designed that could both load commands from memory and take user input to store new commands in memory- that may be what you consider the first OS .", "Like you were 5 ! Computer does not need OS to be able to program stuff . Computer needs OS for example , to be able to run multiple processes at the same time . Which is actually not true either , OS just fakes to be able to , by deciding how time is given to every process to do their thing . Analogy , computer with no OS is like you had a deck of cards , and put them down on table , one by one , on top of each other in a single pile . Faking you do two processes at the same time , what the OS does , is like you putting them in two different piles . What the cards are here , is the time given for program to do it 's stuff . If you put more cards to one pile , or not , is comparable to OS deciding which processes it should give more time . Another analogy : Computer with no OS is like having a meeting with people , but only one guy getting to actually say anything because there is no chairman to decide how to share the time people have to say their things . Computer with OS here , is like the meeting with chairman , who shares the speaking time to people . People being processes , that is , for all purposes here , programs . EDIT : Yes , this has an actual point . This is the explanation of why it does n't matter that there was no OS to be able to program one . Not specifically information about how the first os was programmed . I mean that I think the question was more like \" Why was first OS possible to be programmed , when I think it would need OS to program stuff . \" Which I turned by saying claiming that what he thinks is actually wrong , and explaining what OS is . TL;DR OS is not what you think it is , and because of that , not having one does not make it harder to program an OS .", "They did n't originally started with an OS , they crunched the code directly to the hardware with punchcards until 1981.This was done in single bits ( either 1 or 0 ) because of the processing power of computers at the time . The \" OS \" as we know it came into being after \" programmable computers \" were invented . What they did was store \" libraries \" of code that automated tasks when it became to difficult to do it manually ( as computer power grew ) . eventually with these came programming languages , programs and the OS TL;DR : there were computers designed for programming and nothing else to build software and the OS"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 285.0}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nWhy the Electoral College is still necessary . Why has the Electoral College not been phased out ? And why was it introduced in the first place ? Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* The Electoral College is a thingy in the United States that helps us choose the president. It's like a big voting system that makes sure the president gets elected in a fair way. But why do we need this special system? Let me tell you a story to explain why!\n\nA long time ago, before cars and computers, people didn't have easy ways to communicate with each other. It was hard to know how people in different states were voting. That's where the Electoral College comes in! It's like a big club of people who help make sure that the president gets elected fairly, no matter where they come from.\n\nYou see, the president has to win a lot of votes to become president. They don't just get the job by being the most popular person in one state. They have to win votes in lots of states to win the big prize. The Electoral College is like a map that shows which states have how many votes. The person who gets the most votes in the most states gets to be president!\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"But why can't we just use a popular vote to choose the president?\" That's a great question! Well, the problem is that if we just used a popular vote, people in really big states would have way too much power. They could choose the president just by themselves", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -0.08893945813179016}, {"text": "there", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

It 's a historical leftover , but to change it we 'd have to amend the Constitution . This means that 2/3 of Congress would have to agree on something . It takes a lot of political willpower to get that to happen . My guess is too few Americans understand the E.C. well enough to pressure their representatives to change it .", "In 1787 : There was a fight between the big states and the little states . This deal calmed both sides down since it helped both sides . The bigger states got more electoral college votes , but the smaller states are over - represented . How are smaller states over - represented ? Every state gets at least 3 votes , no matter how small they are . Then , you get more votes as your state gets bigger . So let 's say you have a state that has 100 people in it . It 's very small . Here , the three votes are divided among 100 people , so each person 's vote counts for .03 of an electoral college vote , which are what actually decide the winner . In a bigger state , though , there are 200 people . That 's enough to get 2 more votes , since you get an extra vote every 50 people ( after the first 100 ) . These 200 people are sharing 5 votes , so each person only gets .025 of a vote . Obviously , .03 is more than .025 , so people in the smaller states have a bigger electoral vote . That said , the bigger state still has more votes than the smaller state , so it has a bigger all - around impact . Today : In addition to needing 2/3 of Congress to agree ( which is pretty hard ) , you 'd need 3/4 of the STATES to agree to changing the Constitution . This would NOT happen because the small states like how their votes count for more . If it was just a national vote , everyone 's vote would count for the same . you would need 37 states to OK the amendment , and you would not have enough big states to pass the amendment . A possible solution ? Even though the winner is announced on election day , the electoral college votes are n't actually cast for a little while . You need 217 electoral votes to win . Let 's say you have a lot of states who do n't like the whole system . In fact , you 've got so many states who do n't like the system , if you combined all of them together , you 'd have more than 217 electoral college votes . You get them all together , and you agree to vote for whomever wins the most votes nationally , even if that 's not who your state voted for . That way , you do n't need the small states to agree with you , you just need to gather up 217 votes . Still pretty unlikely , but a man can dream .", "When the US was formed , there was a debate one how the states should be represented . Little states wanted one vote per state , big states wanted to vote by population . As a compromise , Congress has two houses , the Senate , where each state has the same number of votes , and the House of Representatives , where each state gets vote in proportion to its population . In this way , the interests of big states and little states were balanced . The Electoral College is a reflection of this . Each state starts with 2 votes , then gains extra votes depending on population . So a state like Wyoming gets 3 votes , instead of only one , and gets a little more say in the election . The Electoral College served other purposes in the past , but most of them have become obsolete . It has only clearly disagreed with the popular vote once ( Harrison vs. Cleveland , 1888 ) . Three other times ( Adams vs. Jackson 1824 , Hayes vs. Tilden , 1876 , Bush vs. Gore , 2000 ) the loser of the popular vote eventually became president under extenuating circumstances . So a lot of people do n't think it is not worth the effort to change the Constitution over something that only has happened once in the last century ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 294.3333333333333}

Break it down for me , I do n't get what 's going on in Florida . Edit : A lot of great answers , thanks ! Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Let's talk about why some people don't like requiring drug tests for welfare in Florida (and other places).\n\nYou know how sometimes, when you're sick, you go to the doctor to get better? Well, some people need help to get back on their feet after they've been sick or had some other problems. That's where welfare comes in! It's like a safety net that helps people pay for things like food and rent when they can't do it themselves.\n\nBut, sometimes, people might try to take advantage of the welfare system. They might be using drugs or alcohol, and they might not be able to take care of themselves or their families. That's why some states, like Florida, want to make sure that people getting welfare are not using drugs. They think it's fairer that way!\n\nHowever, some people don't like this idea because they think it's too intrusive. They don't want the government to be able to check what they're doing in their own bodies just to get help. They also think it's unfair to make people prove they're drug-free just to get help.\n\nIt's kind of like when you're at school, and you have to take a test to prove you know your times tables.

for such an idea in general . In Florida , the need to consider all of that is largely bypassed because the drug tests are performed at the expense of the aid recipient * at a chain of clinics owned by the governor * . In effect , Florida 's governor has made it a law that everybody has to give him $ 40 .", "Okay basically people do n't like drugs for alot of very good reasons . Drugs cause people to do bad things to get them and when their on them people do n't always think straight . Now in the USA if your very , poor you can be supported by the government . This takes the form of food stamps ( Things you can exchange for food ) , medical insurance ( Called medicaid ) and program to help you find a place to stay . The idea of these program is to provide a safety net if a person fall on really hard times . Now the problem becomes ... what happen if a poor person is using drugs . Many people think if a person is using drugs , then they have enough money to buy their own food . So the government by giving them food stamps is just enabling their drug use . And because drugs are bad the government is doing harm so they should stop giving them support . Other people think that drug are very addictive and that these poor people probably are n't able to kick the habit . So even if the government was n't giving them support they 'd still be drug users ... they just be drug users with out food or medical insurance and they 'd be in a even worst state . A third group think both of these ideas are irrelevant because the USA has no right to test people for drugs . The constitution say that the government needs a warrant to search someone and a drug test should be considered a search . They are going to court to prove their point . Another problem is that testing people is expensive . If your doing drug test your using money that could be spent helping people . Often this money that is being used from drug test is often going to companies that are heavily involved in politics . Further more not all drug show up equally in these test . Marijuana for instance show up on the test for a very long time , which cocaine does not . Also poppy seeds can cause a false positive on the test because Heroine is made from Poppies . There are many other points but these are just a few .", "Well , it 's a complex issue with very polarized sides but the way it basically breaks down is ... On the surface , it does n't sound like a bad idea . After all , who wants the government to be paying to fuel an addict 's habit ? However , a closer look at a few key things show why it might not be as \" innocent \" of a proposal as it initially seems . The first bit is the cost . The amount of people that use welfare money for drugs is somewhere under 10 % -- probably even under 5 % but as I do n't recall the estimate , lets say 10 . Problem is , you have to test * everyone * if it becomes a law . So right off the bat , you 're mandating testing for 90 % of welfare folks that do n't do drugs but you have to anyway . The problem is , drug testing is n't cheap . Whether the government sets up its own lab ( buy cheap tests in bulk , but have to hire tons of people and train them to process all the results ) , or if they go through a 3rd party company ( more $ $ per test ) , it 's going to cost a lot . Couple this with the fact that in order to be effective at catching abusers , they would have to test more than once a year . It adds up quick . The last point I want to mention is that with the case in Florida , the governor 's wife is involved with a drug testing company being used in the new mandate . Serious issues of profiteering are being called into question ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 315.3333333333333}

( Do n't judge me ! ) But the ending is pretty deus ex machina . I 'm not sure what part you did n't understand but the plot is actually pretty simple . Riff Raff and Magenta think the lovely and scrumptious Tim Curry has gone off the rails with all his Rocky baloney . They mutiny and yank their house ( some kind of exploration vehicle ) back to their home planet . They allow the natives to flee , and also to keep their fishnets .", "Alright , so .. Brad and Janet are a couple wholesome , apple pie , square American kids who recently got engaged . While driving around one night , they get a flat tire . Off in the distance , they see some lights in a castle and decide to go there to use the telephone to call for help with their car . There they meet Dr. Frank N. Furter , Riff Raff , his ( implied incestuous ) sister Magenta , and Columbia , their groupie in the middle of a celebration with a bunch of other weirdos . Frank says he found the secret to life itself , unveils his proof in the form of Rocky to those assembled , and then goes on a rampage as Eddie ( Frank and Columbia 's former lover ) crashes the party by bursting out of the freezer . The background partygoers run away as the doctor catches and kills Eddie . All that s left are our main characters now . Brad and Janet get shown to seperate rooms and Frank disguises himself to seduce Janet and Brad . Janet is creeped out by this and runs away , finding Rocky who had been hiding from the abusive Riff Raff . Janet sees Frank in bed with Brad , feels emotional , then gets intimate with Rocky as Magenta and Columbia watch them from a monitor . A bit later , Frank finds out Rocky went missing and goes to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff in tow . There they learn of an intruder into the castle : Dr. Scott , who is Brad and Janet 's old highschool science teacher . They find Janet and Rocky together there also , much to Janets embarrassment , Brad 's dumbfoundedness , and Frank 's anger . Dr. Scott says he 's looking for his nephew Eddie , Frank accuses him of looking for UFO 's under order of the government , and accuses Brad and Janet of being in on the scheme because of their relationship with Dr. Scott . Tension runs high but Magenta interrupts by crashing a gong and announcing dinner . Everyone shares an awkward and tense meal , which they find out to their horror has been prepared from the mutilated and dismembered carcass of Eddie . Janet freaks out and runs to Rocky for comfort , to the chagrin of Brad and anger of Frank who slaps Janet around which just makes Janet wail more and go running off . Everyone but Riff Raff and Magenta follow and end up in the lab , where Frank shoots them with a ray gun that turns them all into statues . Frank dresses up the statues , un - statues them , and forces everyone to perform a hedonistic , worshippy stage show to Frank 's pleasure . Riff Raff and Magenta interrupt , announce they and Frank are actually ALIENS from the planet Transsexual ( in the galaxy Transylvania ) , and that they re taking over and returning there . Frank gets nostalgic about home and returning , Riff Raff and Magenta give him the bad news that he is nt coming . The pair kill Frank , Rocky , and Columbia then release Brad , Janet , and Dr. Scott before zooming off in the castle back to their homeworld . The earthlings are still in their garters and fishnets and are pretty confused and horrified by the whole experience . Unbeknownst to them , Brad and Janet know how to reverse things .. Sadly , The Narrator who s been narrating everything does nt explain to the survivors that everything could be remedied via a simple enough dance . Its just a jump to the left ..", "It 's basically a parody / homage to old Hammer Horror movies of the 60 's . It 's really not meant to be serious , or taken seriously .

A citizen 's arrest is when a regular person ( who is n't a police officer of any kind ) arrests someone who has committed a crime . In the US the rules vary slightly from State to State , but in general anyone can arrest a person they see commit a felony . They then have to hand them over to the police promptly . The difference between this and a police arresting you is that the police can arrest you for crimes someone else saw and then tells the police about , where a citizen can only arrest you for something they see happen . It works the same way a regular arrest would , it could be the citizen simply saying , your under arrest and then waiting for the cops to come , up to full on handcuffing and the whole 9 yards . In some states , if you citizens arrest someone , and you were n't legally justified you might face civil lawsuit for doing so . URL_1 URL_0", "Ok , this is n't easy to answer , because we have many states in our country , and they all have laws that can be slightly different . So the answer is going to have to be general , and you 're going to have to realize that in one place it may be different than another . The way a citizens arrest works is that you , as a good person , see someone else being bad . So you tell them \" You are under arrest ! ! \" in your best big - boy voice , and then you call 9 - 1 - 1 and the police come to take them away . Now there are a few things to have to do to make sure you do this right . First off , you have to SEE the person do the bad thing . You ca n't be told by someone else and then go grab the person . This is called \" Witnessing the crime . \" Second , the bad thing they do has to be what 's called a \" felony . \" Now , there are two types of crimes in our county , Misdemeanors and Felonies . Misdemeanors are the little crimes , like slapping someone or stealing candy from a store . Felonies are the big crimes , like really hurting someone on purpose , or robbing a bank . So if you see someone doing something wrong , you need to think , \" Is this a big bad , or a small bad ? \" If it 's a small bad , you need to call 9 - 1 - 1 and let the police handle it . If it 's a big bad , though , and if you do n't stop the person RIGHT NOW someone can get hurt , then you can step in and arrest them . Now there are certain things you need to do once you 've arrested them . First off is make sure that when you are talking to 9 - 1 - 1 ( you already called them , remember ? ) you tell them what you have done . This lets the police officers know that they have to get there faster , because arresting someone when you are n't a police officer can be dangerous . Secondly , you ca n't beat the person up . They may have done a really , REALLY big bad , like hurt a little kid or even killed someone , and you are going to be very , very angry . But like Mr Rogers says , \" Being mad is ok , but you ca n't hurt people because you are mad . \" Now , you can \" defend \" yourself if the person tries to hurt you . That means you can fight BACK , but you ca n't start the fight . But above all , if you see someone doing something bad , call the police . They are the ones who go to school to be police officers , and they have all the tools there on their belt , and they know all sorts of things about laws and dealing with someone who wants to hurt you or other people . Ok ?", "I 've wondered about the specifics of citizen 's arrest in the US as well . Does anyone know what the law is in Canada regarding citizen 's arrest ? Does it exist ?"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 301.0}

Nixon was up for re - election , was probably going to win anyway . But the Democrats were smearing Nixon in the press , so Nixon formed a committee to smear the Democrats back . Ok , harmless enough . The Attorney General headed this committee , but Nixon added on a guy named G Gordon Liddy ( who had gained Nixon 's trust by helping him with the first election and stayed on for the first term ) to brainstorm some bolder ideas . Liddy originally proposed some crazy shit : hiring prostitutes for a boat full of Democratic politicians and take a bunch of photos , kidnapping Democrats and keeping them captive in Mexico for awhile , and , oh ... breaking into the Democratic Committee 's office and wiretapping everything . Attorney General Mitchell originally rejected it all , but Liddy kept pushing in future meetings , and in a weird compromise , Mitchell ended up saying \" fine , fine ... no prostitutes or kidnappings , but we 'll keep the wiretapping , happy ? \" And so G Gordon Liddy and some help broke into the Democratic Committee 's office , cops came , busted them . FBI found out Nixon paid the burglars and tried covering it up . Big problem .", "TL;DR : Nixon , president at the time , send some guys into the Democratic National Committee HQ ( located in the Watergate office complex , hence the name ) to snoop around and place some wires to know what the Democrats were up to .", "The thing to recall is that Nixon was by nature a paranoid person and the times they were a changin ' . The other thing to recall is this was the era of Vietnam wind - down and post Summer of Love . The national culture was changing . Lots of talk in back rooms about ( godless ) commies trying to take over America using hippies as their tools of destruction , that sort of thing . ( Recall further this was all that long after the Red Scare era in America . ) So Nixon represented a defense against the perceived social upheaval , if not advance of communism , which would take place if McGovern won the election . This was an election of bitter social divides . Some people who believed so fiercely in the need for Nixon to remain in office were willing to do illegal acts in order to assure same . The justification was as President Nixon was above the law , that whatever he did was legal since he was the President . This was called \" Executive Privilege . \" The rest is well - recorded , of course . They got caught breaking in , which led to the discovery of a slush fund used to finance such ( not ) illegal things which led to the growing realization that Nixon participated in the effort to cover everything up ( and this is where it gets good ) which led to the growing realization that the President would be up for impeachment and would likely be subject to same . It also caused a supreme court case which forever removed any doubt that the President was not , in fact , above the law . So he resigned , thereby maintaining the rather cushy lifestyle a Presidential pension allows . It really shook up the country . This was the era post Pentagon Papers , where people realized we were being lied to about the Vietnam war , and then the whole cultural revolution of that same era . Worse came the post resignation case taken to the supreme court . See , Ford , the VP , became prez after Nixon resigned , and the first thing he did was issue a pardon to Nixon . ( I ca n't remember the case name but ) a case was taken to the Supreme Court questioning if this was a just act , since at that point Nixon was so obviously criminal . The Supremes voted that it was constitutional for Ford to issue the pardon , since not doing so would create so much turmoil in the country . Which is to say the Supreme Court decided some people were above the law , in effect . Think about that the next time you hear about some rich guy getting away with murder ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 276.0}

Well, it's kind of like a special kind of communication that only works when you're close to a WiFi network. It's like a secret language just between you and the network.\n\nNow, when you turn on your WiFi, it's like you're telling your phone to use that secret language to talk to the WiFi network. And that means your phone can get really good at understanding where it is in relation to the WiFi network. It's like a game of \"find the phone\" where the WiFi network is giving your phone clues to help it find its way!\n\nCellular network is like a different kind of language that your phone uses to talk to the world when it's away from WiFi. It's like a very loudspeaker that can reach really far, but it can't give your phone as precise location information as WiFi can. It's like trying to find someone in a crowded room using only a loudspeaker – it's okay, but it's not as accurate as if you had a special device that could see their face!\n\nSo, by turning on WiFi,

Wifi networks tend to be more concentrated and numerous than cellular networks so it can get a more precise location .", "I wrote my final work at university about localisation with wireless networks . The problem with it is it sucks . You can talk it pretty and i did it a lot in my work because i wanted it to sound good and usable . But if you have any other possibility of localisation it is a lot better than triangulation with WiFi networks . But there is one important reason to use it , indoor navigation . As soon as you enter a building you will most likely lose your GPS signal and your great localisation ability . And Wifi is a great way to close this localization gap . And it is good enough to tell you in which room you are ( as long as you are in bigger rooms ) but errors of 5 meters or more are something that will happen a lot . The main problem with Wifi localization is that it 's usually done by checking the signal strength of the wifi network and it differs a lot , it depends on weather , humidity , materials used and even how many people are around . It 's really hard to make a model that takes all of those factors into consideration and is able to give a good localization result . In addition to that there 's the problem that modern routers usually have some kind of energy saving option that will disturb your measurements even more . There may be some exceptions to this , some museums / supermarkets have a very controlled area where weather / humidity and routers do n't change that often . This allows you to have a rather good localization indoors . Another possibility of improving your localization would be the pure mass of wifi networks , for example in a skyscraper filled with flats and wifi networks - the pure mass of information will give you a rather good position . And in both of those cases GPS is n't available or a viable option to rely on , which makes WiFi not only the best but the only way to locate your phone . Edit : and of course to use WiFi to locate your phone you need to have a database that tells you where all the different WiFi routers are . It may come from Google cars or a supermarket may provide the exact positions . For better advertisement or guided museum tours , where the WiFi is set up to be used as a localization tool . And i should mention that you can use special algorithems that fuse gps and wifi localization but if you compare the additional energy consumption you need to the improvement in your position it 's usually not worth it at all . Even though a small improvement can be achieved even when you use gps , basically a computer can guess how wrong both gps and wifi are and calculate some kind of average to get the best of both . But best of both is usually GPS .", "Your smart phone GPS ( using the term GPS loosely because it not always uses actual GPS ) determines your location in a myriad of different ways including but not limited to : data collected by Google street cars , Comcast WAPs ( you may have heard about how Comcast automatically turns on a second \" guest \" WiFi that is actually coming from your router ) , but I think the biggest contributing factor is our phones themselves constantly reporting which WiFi access points are in range . Simply put , as more data is collected things like location gets more accurate . Wireless Access Points nowadays also have additional antennas that are for polling the area and seeing who is passing in and out of their signals . They actually do some really incredible stuff called \" presence analytics \" where they log if you came in to range , connected , or simply passed through a WAP . I have a client who uses devices with this feature in stores in malls . You can , in real time or over a period of time , see how perhaps a sale at the store next door effects traffic coming in to your store . I kinda went off track , but this kind of stuff gets my nipples hard ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 301.6666666666667}

That's kind of like how the fourth dimension works! 🤯\n\nIn the fourth dimension, you can see and explore all the different shapes and objects that make up the world, but you can also see them in different angles and perspectives.

Since ancient times , people have used numbers to measure physical quantities . But how many numbers do we need ? - To measure length , we use ONE number . Let 's call this number * x * - To measure area , we use TWO numbers . Let 's call these two numbers * x * and * y * . To find the area of a rectangle of sides * x * and * y * say , we just multiply the two numbers together and write * xy * as the area . - To measure volume , we use THREE numbers . For a box of length * x * , depth * y * , width * z * , we do the same thing and multiply the numbers together . Now this is all good because we can see all this is our daily lives and it 's the typical examples we use to describe our 3 dimensional space . But we fail to think what object looks 4D. * * Alternative Visualisation * * : Here 's is another way of thinking about this dimension business , and it 's possible to \" see \" 4 dimensions in a funny way : - Suppose you have a piece of string and I told you to cut it at a specific point , I will need to tell you how far from the end of the string you need make the cut at . This uses ONE number . - How about if I tell you to punch a hole in a piece of paper ? How do we locate the hole ? Well , just like on a map , I need to give you two numbers so you know how far to go horizontally and vertically on the map . This requires TWO numbers . - Now to the * important * part , what if I gave you two separate pieces of paper and told you to punch a hole in each piece of paper ? As above , each hole requires two numbers , so to give you the full instructions this time , I will need to give you a total of FOUR numbers ( two for each piece of paper ) . This is how we could think of 4 dimensions . * * TLDR * * : 2 separate pieces of paper . * * Bonus Fact * * : In ancient times , people did not know how to multiply 4 numbers together for the precise reason that I gave in the introduction - they did not know how to visualise an object of 4 dimensions . * * Edit * * : Of course , this can be generalised so that you can start imagining any even dimensional space as multiple pieces of paper ! e.g. 3 sheets of paper gives you 6 dimensional space . As for odd dimensions , you can for example , make 3 dimensional space by one piece of paper and one string . So to make a 9 dimensional space , think of 4 sheets of paper ( which contributes 8 dimensions ) and one piece of string ( which contributes a 1 dimensional space ) which makes up a 9 dimensions .", "This probably wo n't answer your question , but it might help you visualize the possible answers . Imagine a universe on a sheet of paper , that universe only exists in 2 dimensions . There is a black circle that can move across that sheet of paper , it ca n't travel up or down but simply slide along the paper . You draw a box around the circle and it 's trap inside the four sides , all it can see is the black ink . To save the sheet of paper , you pick it up . It can only perceive 2 dimensions but it is being carried around in a 3 dimensional space . It would see an infinitely small cross section of the 3 dimensional universe that we exists in , it would that tiny cross section of our face . Take that limited point of view of the 2 dimensional and extend that to our 3 dimensions . That is how we would perceive the 4th dimension ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 280.6666666666667}

As you can see the unapproved piece goes through Montana and Nebraska representing a straight path from Alberta to Texas . The controversy is with Nebraska . Nebraska charged against the pipeline indicating environmental problems regarding clean water . The state government supported them . So there was an initial ban . After they re - worked the path of the pipeline to spend as little time around water reserves the state government supported it . However Barack Obama came out swinging indicating that he would veto any request to make the pipeline until a review has been done . Congress just passed the bill for the pipeline where it will go on to the Republican dominated Senate who will vote it to the president who will potentially veto it . Since he 's dealing with a Republican Senate and Republican Congress he can potentially lose power to do anything if he does n't sign the bill into law . The other major controversy is around EU propaganda in regards to the oilsands . It 's worth noting they 've since retracted and denied such propaganda . The EU claimed all oilsands are \" dirty oil \" because they pollute more than other oils . EU was getting oil from Africa which had their own oilsands projects which were n't getting the dirty oil designation ... because the EU bought oil from them . However now that Russia 's oil is out the dirty oil designation is gone . There was also unfactual information stating that fuel made with bitumen ( oilsands ) is less fuel efficient than regular oil . In reality America has been getting bitumen for quite some time now ( because as you can see the map does bring oil from Canada into the United States ) . Basically any environmental protester has tried to spread as much misinformation as possible . The information as it was ( that the oilsands contribute 3 % of the total carbon emissions for the world ) is damning enough without making stuff up . It 's a politically tenuous issue that divides the left and the right in both Canada and the United States . If you are against the Keystone XL you are regarded as a liberal and if you are for it a conservative . Because the debate is designed this way there is no way to talk to the fanatics on either side .", "Pipes leak . They always do . A very long pipeline will leak on a lot of currently pretty pristine land . A lot of the intervening land the pipe must cross are native reserves and many people accuse the oil companies of coercion or bribes to get permission for some of the land , and that it 's really not in the best interests of the people that live there who are already having enough trouble with access to fresh , clean water and the like . It 'd fan the flames of the operations on the Alberta tar sands , which are controversial in their own right . Getting oil from the tar sands is obscenely bad for the environment . Continued reliance on oil is also per se a controversial issue . Many people would rather not make oil reliance easier to encourage development in other directions ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 295.3333333333333}

But, just like how the value of your toy car changes, the value of money between countries can change too! 🚀\n\nThere are a few reasons why exchange rates go up and down:\n\n1. Supply and demand: Just like how there might be more kids who want to play with a really cool toy, sometimes there might be more people who want to use the money from one country compared to another. This can make the money from that country worth more, so it goes up in value. On the other hand, if there are fewer people who want to use the money from one country, it can go down in value. 🤝\n2. Economic stuff: Just like how you might not want to play with a toy if it's broken, some countries might not want to use their money if they think it's not valuable.

I 'll give an example ( i have many of them like demand / supply and import /export driven etc , but I 'm on my phone so I 'll give you only one ) . For simplicity , Let 's assume my nation of 10 citizens uses a stone chip as a currency and your nation of 10 citizens uses glass chips . And we start off trading on 1 stone chip equals 1 glass chip . Now imagine , My nation some how found itself in a depression and decided to pick up few more stones from the ground and decided to call it money . ( like the Fed reserve prints money out of thin air ) . So every one in my nation has plenty of those stones already ( worthless at this point ) . Would you still sell me your 5 glass chips worth of product for 5 stone chips ? I.e. We could easily bankrupt you by taking your products and hand you worthless stone chips . Edit : for clarity", "It 's all about how much people will pay in one currency for another currency . In some ways , currencies are like stock shares in the issuing country . You might consider the total amount of money that exists in a given currency as the market capitalization of the country . Shares / currencies rise and fall in value relative to other shares / currencies as public opinion changes about the long - term stability of the company / country . The Yen and Ruble have been falling relative to the dollar lately because the prevailing opinion of the stability of the Japanese and Russian economies is faltering . The US economy appears to finally be strengthening again , so people holding Yen and Rubles would rather sell short to get into Dollars than hold those currencies and wait for them to rise again .", "Flexibile exchange rates are determined by the world 's demand and supply for the given currency . Individual people , investors , firms , and governments all demand a certain amount of a country 's currency at a point in time and that country will supply a certain amount of that currency . If the supply of the currency remains constant ( i.e. their central bank does not print more of it ) and more people decide that they want to buy more of the currency , the currency will appreciate and it will become more expensive to purchase . The opposite happens if people decide they do n't want the currency anymore and decide to sell it . A flexible exchange rate is important for many countries because it can act as a tool the central bank can use to help out the domestic economy if the economy is too heated or if it is in a recession . Because the central bank manipulate 's the interest rate in the domestic economy , they indirectly manipulate the demand for the domestic currency and thus indirectly affect exports and therefore aggregate demand . How does this happen ? Say , for example , the US is going into a recession . The Federal Reserve can then lower the interest rate in the American economy . When this happens , many of the American bonds investors can choose from will now have a lower interest rate which means they are not as valuable compared to other bonds in the world , say Canadian bonds ( holding all else constant ) . Investors will then decide to sell their American bonds ( or not buy any at all ) and sell American currency so they can exchange it for Canadian currency and invest in Canadian bonds which have a higher rate of return and are more profitable . The act of investors selling American currency causes the supply of American currency to increase , and if we hold the demand constant , the American currency will then be worth not as much . If American currency is not worth as much , American goods and services will be relatively cheaper , so foreigners will demand more American goods and services because they are cheaper relative to other foreign goods from other countries . The result is that the American economy begins to export more goods , and this means more jobs in the American economy , and so the economy will begin to heat up again and the impact of the recession will be smaller ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 293.66666666666663}

That's entropy!\n\nAnother way to think about it is that entropy is a measure of the amount of energy that is \"wasted\" or \"thrown away\" in a system. *exaggerated gesture* Like when you're trying to make a cake, but you forget to add an ingredient, and the cake comes", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -0.2904985547065735}, {"text": "there",

You can fight against it ( new stars can form , buildings can be repaired , organisms reproduce , chemical reactions can create new molecules ) but eventually given enough time , everything will come apart .", "Yikes .. the amount of misinformation here . Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat / energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass / density of that system is still the same . So what changed ? And that 's where the concept of entropy comes in as a measure of that change . Um , so that 's more the classical definition . The concept has evolved beyond just physics and I think the definition then really depends on the application .", "It 's just probability . Consider all the possible outcomes of tossing a hundred coins , and make a histogram for number - of - heads . Obviously there 's precisely one outcome for 0 or 100 heads , 100 outcomes for 1 or 99 heads ... and ramping exponentially up to squillions of combinations with 50 heads . Take a given layout of 100 coins on a table , thwack the table with your fist to make coins jump in the air , and you 're pretty much guaranteed that your random change will result in N getting closer to 50 , rather than closer to 0 or 100 . Now repeat the same experiment with hot and cold molecules in a glass of water . There 's a hell of a lot more ways for them to be more or less evenly distributed than there are for them to be separated . As they do the Brownian Shake , the intermixedness is , statistically speaking , only going to increase . It 's a drunkard 's walk with steps Ω / ω high ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 305.0}

Service . \" This is n't a hack or an act of \" breaking into \" a computer - network system . Instead the goal is to clog up the bandwidth available to people to access the system . You can think of it as a public pool on a hot summer day . The pool is a service with a maximum number of people who can be in and swimming at one time . On most days it has a fair number of people who are in swimming around and on others it may have fewer . Sometimes it is closed for maintenance . Then there 's that day when too many people are there . You 're in the queue to get in but it 's hard to establish any kind of order . People are pushing and shoving to get through first and many are frustrated when they do get in because the pool is already full . As soon as one person gets out another two or three fight over the spot . And what 's worse is a lot of the people in the pool are n't even doing anything but standing around . * * A DDoS takes a large volume of computers and other devices that can access the internet and continuously sends requests towards a target . * * Xbox Live is a service with many servers in many locations , implying that an attack like this has taken some time to prepare and execute . The computers in the DDoS only have to send as many \" requests \" as they can each second . They do n't have to wait for responses from the Xbox Live servers , * * they just have to send so many requests that the servers can not keep up , effectively preventing others from accessing this service . * *", "I think we should also explain how to stop these attacks and why even with billions of dollars , it can be difficult to completely negate these attacks . One way to protect a network from DDOS is to just have LOTS and LOTS of bandwidth and spread your information over LOTS of servers . which of course takes LOTS of money . Another is of course proper network security , a firewall looks for and blocks non important or false network traffic , they try to filter out basic attacks and block repeat signals so that you can free up bandwidth and make yourself harder to hit . Of course the big corporations have very expensive and well maintained firewalls , but no wall is immune if the attacker is dedicated , persistent and willing to do the work . and the last ability a company has to defend themselves are their network maintainers / defenders . These people are supposed to be able to see the attacks as they come in and modify the firewall to customize it against the attacks coming in . Most hacking attempts , specially BOT nets , use a one size fits all attack . Each computer firing the same type of \" ammunition \" so a skilled defender can see the pattern and tell the firewall to ignore those packets . But it requires a lot of skill and costs a lot of money to maintain a full time skilled network defense . Most companies have an outside source that they can call upon to protect their networks . Once the attack occurs , they can call up the company to have someone come out to fix the wall and stop the attack . You 'll also notice that most of these attacks are only for a few hours at most and that 's why . It takes time to figure out the attack and patch the firewall to stop it , but it will happen sooner or later . But that 's why even billion dollar tech companies can be targeted and shut down . it wo n't last long , but when you are talking losing millions in sales and such , and also spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to stop it it is sometimes worth just paying them to not hit you . Hope this clears up some other questions that might come up .", "It 's getting fucking annoying that 's for sure . I 'm thinking they plan to shut down PSN , Xbox Live , and Steam on Christmas ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 292.33333333333337}

Okay . First off , its aneurysm . It refers to a structural weakening of a vessel wall , resulting in prominent bulging as blood pressure pushes against it . Typically , these aneurysms arise in major vessels , such as the aorta , basilar arteries , carotids , or any of the vessels composing the brain artery complex known as the ' Circle of Willis ' . If these aneurysms get severe enough , they can rupture , causing you to bleed out into your brain . Because these ruptures occur in the major vessels , it results in a rapid , dramatic loss of blood flow to your brain . It does n't ' kill instantly ' but depending on the size and location , it can cause rapid loss of consciousness and subsequent death as your brain becomes starved of blood and oxygen .", "As you may have noticed , this entire thread is now locked .

We 're not going to speculate as to whether or not \" anus rhythm \" was a carefully - crafted title to get upvotes or a simple victim of autocorrect , but for the purposes of this submission , we 're giving the OP the benefit of the doubt , and erring on the side of \" autocorrect mishap \" . So the title itself is not the direct issue . The issue is how others are responding to that title . If you read the rules in the sidebar , they say : > Direct replies to the original post ( aka \" top - level comments \" ) are for serious responses only . Jokes , anecdotes , and low effort explanations are not permitted and subject to removal . The only valid responses to the question posed by the OP are ones that take the typo in stride ( maybe even joke about it , that 's fine ) , and then * explain how aneurysms work * . That 's it . That 's the only type of top - level comment that we allow ( that , or a related , * serious * followup question ) . Instead , over 95 % of the comments have been jokes or snide remarks about \" anus rhythms \" ( including made - up disease descriptions ) , variations of \" lol \" , and against - the - rules ( if well - intentioned ) anecdotes that lack any explanation . Per our subreddit rules , we 've been removing these comments . However keeping this thread pruned is taking a serious amount of effort . As of this writing , there are eight serious responses , and * * hundreds * * of removed joke responses . And the joke responses are pouring in faster than we can reasonably keep up with . At this point , we feel that there have been enough serious responses to explain aneurysms to the OP , and the effort of keeping up with the flood of rule - breaking responses is detracting from our ability to moderate the rest of the subreddit , hence the \" nuclear option \" .", "First off ....

Why is it so difficult to create something without bugs ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Oh, cool question! *adjusts glasses*\n\nYou know how sometimes you play with toys and they break, or you build with blocks and they come crashing down? Well, bugs are kind of like that too! *exaggerated expression*\n\nYou see, when programmers write code, they're like toy builders. They use special blocks called \"code blocks\" and they put them together to make something awesome, like a game or a robot. But sometimes, just like how building with blocks can be tricky, programmers can accidentally make mistakes in their code. These mistakes are like the blocks that break when you touch them too hard, or the blocks that fall over when you bump them with a toy car. They're called \"bugs\". *nods*\n\nNow, you might be wondering why it's so hard to make something without bugs. Well, the thing is, code is like a really long, really complicated puzzle. There are so many pieces that need to fit together just right, or else it can all fall apart. It's kind of like trying to put together a giant puzzle blindfolded, with the pieces changing shape every second! *winces*\n\nThat's why programmers have to be really good at their job and pay close attention to all the little details, like a kindergartener counting blocks.

that can come about in different ways . Here are a few examples : - The user enters something in a format which the programmer had n't expected - There is a particular combination of events which , individually , work fine , but when combined cause the program to take a path which the programmer had n't thought of - Something external - some hardware , or a database , for example - returns an unexpected value to the program - The program works for a finite amount of time or a finite amount of data , but crashes after some arbitrary limit is reached - The programmer made a typo . ( Most of these will be picked up by the compiler because they will result in what is called a \" syntax error \" , but some of them , if they are syntactically correct , will compile ok . ) - The programmer implemented the design as per the specification , but the specification was wrong I 'm sure there are more , these are just the first ones that spring to mind .", "Professional software engineer here . The most common types of bugs are : 1 . A logic error . These are most often just mistakes made by the programmer . The mistake might be because the programmer had a momentary lapse of concentration or because they did n't quite understand something . For example , testing that two things are equal when the test should have been if they are * not * equal . 2 . Lack of or poor error handling . For almost everything that can be done in software , there are at least 3 other ways in which that might go wrong . Trying to write to a new file , for example , might fail if a file with that name already exists , if there are permission problems , if the disk is full or a quota is exceeded , if another program is simultaneously trying to write to the same file , if the file system has become corrupt , if the system is running out of memory and a whole host of other things . Handling these cases is an important part of writing a program , but because many of them rarely happen in practice and programmers can be lazy , they 're not handled correctly or at all . So most of the time the program works fine , but on the rare occasion when the disk is full , for example , the program does n't properly check for and handle that error and does something unexpected . 3 . Mismatching expectations from different programmers . Often programs contain code written by more than one programmer , and these different pieces of code must work together . Well engineered software is broken down into separate independent components that can be independently designed , implemented and tested . Sometimes when two components that appear to work fine independently are used together , something goes wrong . They might both be stepping on each other 's feet by fighting over the same resource or one might try to use the other , but expect it to work slightly differently from how it actually does . 4 . The programmer makes assumptions that are not necessarily true . They might be true on the programmer 's own system where the program works fine , but if the program is run on a different system , it might fail because the assumptions are no longer valid . For example , they might assume that another program is already installed , or that the OS is installed to the C:\\ drive .", "Programming with no bug is essentially the same as telling stories with no kind of inconsistencies ( in the facts , the scenes , the thought patterns and emotions of characters , any kind of inconsistencies . ) For extremely short ones , that might be doable , though surprisingly hard . The biggest you get , the more unlikely it gets . Actually , one could say that a story with no inconsistencies is impossible . It is the nature of a story to sometimes trump expectations . In the same way , a program with no bug is impossible , as someone 's bug will be someone else 's feature . ( Still some inconsistencies are more obviously unwelcome than others . )"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 308.33333333333337}

They do , and the rest of the season is completely unrelated . ( BTW , Luna is now not evil anymore , but she is n't seen again . ) The other episodes have little to do with each other , but a few ( including the finale ) focus on the Grand Galloping Gala , which is a big fancy party held in Canterlot ( The royal city ) .

"answers": ["Republicans ( a group Ron Paul is in ) have a lot of ideas , many frequently concern limited government . Ron Paul pushes those values to what some might consider the logical conclusion ( others might consider he pushes them into absurdity ) . This means he has some views which makes him unique among most other republicans . One of those is that he does n't think congress should do * * anything * * if the constitution does n't explicitly allow congress to do it . He supports \" noninterventionism \" which basically means he thinks we should n't get involved with stuff in other countries . He voted against the Iraq invasion in ' 02 ( one of few republicans to do so ) because of this . He thinks the US should remove itself from international agreements / grouops like NAFTA , WTO , NATO , and the United Nations . This is a very uncommon view among politicians . He also would like to completely remove the Federal Reserve , a very large government institution . He is the only republican during the ' 08 debates that specifically stated that our policies in the Middle East ( neoconservatism ) are responsible for helping to cause the terrorists which exist today . This is a common liberal viewpoint . The large majority of the votes where a single person votes against a bill in the house , are his votes . He never voted to approve a budget deficit . He believes the US could get rid of the income tax if they cut spending to 2000 levels . He is rare among republicans in opposing the Patriot Act , which was passed after september 11th and allows the goverment a large amount of power to investigate supposed terrorists . In short : He takes the views generally expressed by republicans ( small government , personal freedom , free trade ) but he applies those views universally and very consistently . This puts him in positions where he does n't go with the rest of the pack when they make an exception , leaving him nearly alone supporting many positions . My Bias - I 'm a democrat and think many of Ron Paul 's ideas are not good ideas . But time and time again I find myself pleasantly surprised by his actions , especially voting against the Patriot Act when very few on either party would . Edit - Fixed Iraq year , added note about the fed .", "ELI5 : The various ideas that Mr. Paul likes would involve changing a whole lot of things that people have gotten used to . When people get used to doing something a certain way , they usually do n't like to change , because it 's hard ( like it 's hard to instantly stop running if you 're running really fast ) . Even if things are n't going real well , people still usually do n't like to change . Sometimes that 's because they 're lazy , sometimes it 's because they 're greedy and are getting something from the system as it is , and sometimes it 's because they 're afraid if they change , then something will break . When you make changes , sometimes things break that you did n't expect . As hard as you work and as carefully as you plan , sometimes when you change stuff , things happen that you did n't plan for , and something breaks . So that makes people scared of change .", "Many people do take Ron Paul seriously . For the most part , the people who do not take Ron Paul seriously are the people in charge of telling other people about Ron Paul , essentially the media and other people in power . They do not like him , because Ron Paul spends more time talking about his ideas than he does making friends with people in power . This is true of a lot of people who have a lot of ideas and feel very strongly about them . They forget that people are more likely to support you and your ideas if you are nice to them and make them feel important . Sometimes doing that means not being totally committed to your ideas . Ron Paul is more committed to his ideas than to building powerful supporters . You need powerful supporters to be considered a serious candidate ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 283.33333333333337}

Well, math is like a special kind of toy called \"math problems\". These problems come in different shapes and sizes, just like how blocks, Legos, and dolls come in different shapes and sizes too! 😊\n\nCommon Core math is like a set of rules that help us play with these math problems. It's like a game where we have to use different strategies to solve the problems. It's kind of like playing Tetris, where we have to use different shapes to fit everything together just right. 🕹️\n\nOne of the most important things about Common Core math is that it teaches us to think critically and creatively. It's not just about memorizing answers or doing simple calculations. It's about understanding the concepts behind the numbers, and how those concepts can help us solve problems in different ways. It's like playing a game of \"What if?\" where we have to think about all the different possibilities and come up with the best solution. 🤔\n\nAnother cool thing about Common Core math is that it teaches us to communicate our thinking.

URL_0 Further , the Common Core is standardized across states . That means that whichever Common Core state you live in , you should be able to do either of the things I listed . The particular details of how to teach a student to do these things is * entirely the responsibility of their school * . As long as the student can \" Solve word problems that call for addition \" by the end of Grade 1 , the Common Core does n't care how they do it or how they were taught .", "The common core is designed to teach math in a manner consistant with how people think . For instance , 17 from 52 . The way I was taught to so this problem was to write 52 17 And then substract 7 from 2 , which is n't helpful , so you ' borrow ' a 10 from 50 ' and substract 7 from 12 . Cross out the 5 , write a 4 in its place , and write ' 5 ' below the 7 ( 12 - 7 ) . And so on . But that 's not how we subtract naturally . We think \" well 52 is close to 50 and 17 is close to 20 . 50 - 20 is easy : 30 . Then add the two you ignored from 52 : 32 , and the 3 you ignored going from 17 to 20 : 35 . \" Each of us may choose arbitrary places to put those values ( \" 52 is close to 50 ' 17 is close to 15 \" ) but the process is the same . We break hard problems down into easy problems and then add back the bits we skipped . That 's part of how the common core teaches math . The old way works , but students came out the other end not knowing why . It produced generations of students who did math purely by cargo cult thinking .", "Common core addition is known as the cashier 's method , because cashier 's used to use it to quickly compute correct change in their heads . Essentially , you round numbers to the 10 's & 100 's to add quickly add them . For example , 42 +13 . Change that to 40 +10=50 & 2 + 3=5 then 50 + 5=55 . For a bigger number , 239 + 829 would be 200 + 800=1000 & 40 + 30=70 so you get 1000 + 70= 1070 minus the two you added = 1068 . You 've probably heard a lot of objections to common core , like it 's too complicated or it takes too long or it 's telling teachers how to teach . In reality , these are all false arguments . Parents do n't like it because they do n't intuitively understand it , but that does n't make it wrong or harder . Anything takes a long time when you 're first learning . Lastly , common core is a set of nationwide standards , it is not a curriculum , it 's not a test , it 's not a government mandate .

Yes , when you have low self - esteem , depression etc . you have a chemical imbalance , but that explains * what * is happening , not * why * it is happening . All of these problems come from a disorder in thinking , and are based around negative * perceptions * people have of themselves . When an alcoholic picks up another bottle of beer even though every thought in his mind is telling him not , he does n't decide to drink it anyway because a chemical imbalance is causing low - self esteem , he drinks it anyway because he subconsciously does n't * believe * he can . That 's why a guy might go years without asking out a girl due to believing he is undesirable and boring , and a result of that is that he 'll develop a chemical imbalance because of it . However , when one day he finds himself alone with the pretty girl he 's been helping do homework and decides to just go for it and she says yes , he 'll * instantly * feel over the moon and incredibly self - confident , since his idea that he 's undatable has been shattered and him coming to this realisation feels incredibly powerful and liberating . A result of this is that physically , his chemicals in his brain have changed , but he did n't feel good * because * they changed , they changed because * he felt good . *", "I have clinical depression coupled with bi - polar and antisocial personality disorder . The reason why I have these is a chemical imbalance that I have had since I was 3 . The meds I take so I 'm told give me the stuff I need so I have a comparable chemical buildup as someone who is \" normal \" but chemical imbalance is vague . I 'll explain it the way it was explained to me . It 's not uncommon for people to have different chemical make ups brain wise . I have a family history of mental illness so I was prone to it . Also you can change the way your brain works quite easily . As a teen I did ungodly amounts of xtc , coke and k. Not only does it burn out receptors . It raises thresholds of happiness , pain , everything really . So I will never be content at a level comparable to \" normal \" cause my pleasure threshold is so much higher then everyone else . Sex to you would feel a lot more pleasurable then for me . Goes for everything . After you spend years at an elevated mental state nothing normal will be comparable again . Coupled with my dopamine receptors being burnt out , Not all of them lol there are tons of reasons why and how chemicals can cause not only depression . Even psychosis .

But making these molecules is very complex and takes a lot of energy . So , instead of recreating these molecules , your body tends to reuse them where possible . At some point , due to external or internal influences , your body starts to reuse some chemicals too much , depleting the amount of chemicals available for whatever they are needed for ( e.g. see certain things as dangerous , if you have too few of a certain chemical , you start seeing everything as a danger to yourself ) So , in basic , a lack of , or too much of , a specific chemical in your body , triggers certain actions in your brain . Just like too much alcohol can destroy your liver , too much of certain chemicals can cause imbalance in your brain , causing anxiety , esteem - issues , anger - issues etc ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 303.66666666666663}

These molecules are like little building blocks that fit together just right, like puzzle pieces! 🧩 And they help the mommy and daddy animal make the right mix of chemicals to make a tiny, tiny baby.\n\nBut sometimes, the molecules from different animals don't fit together quite right. They're like puzzle pieces that don't match! 😳 So, they can't make a baby that's healthy and strong. It's like trying to build a house with the wrong pieces - it just won't work! 🏠🚧\n\nIt's pretty cool, though!

: Long - Legs Short - Arms Blue - Eyes The left half and the right half can create a meaningful trait . But as species vary in length of position of their genes , you could wind up with : Long - Kidneys Short - Red Blood Cells Blue - ( nothing ) The words and phrases do n't make any sense , so life does n't happen . The above is incredibly simplistic , obviously , but that is the basic principle . Some species can interbreed in a limited fashion .", "I believe you are confusing everything , human and horses ca n't have a baby because of the number of chromosome pairs , nothing in a molecular level matter here ...

You should check this article : URL_0", "I 'm assuming you do n't mean \" with the help of a laboratory , \" so I 'm gon na come at it from an evolutionary biology perspective . By definition , two different species are two populations which do n't reproduce , for any reason . That 's \" do n't , \" not \" ca n't . \" There are multiple reasons why it might not work . For example , I believe dogs and wolves are entirely physically capable , and sometimes do reproduce , but the hybrids are n't accepted by either wolf or dog packs for whatever social reasons . The opposite gendered wolves and dogs are simply put off by the hybrid , hence wo n't have sex with it , and that 's enough to make them dogs and wolves not the same species . Other times it 's things like two species of butterfly which are basically the same except one is nocturnal and the other diurnal . Ca n't have sex if you 're never awake at the same time . Or two species with entirely different mating rituals . Then there 's physical incompatibility , like physically it wo n't fit . Or one species does n't even have \" it . \" There are sea - dwelling species that just eject their sperm into the water for females to collect as they swim by , they are n't going to be reproducing with any wolves any time soon . Then there 's DNA incompatibility , which others here have expanded on . But there 's two types , DNA incompatibility which prevents the creation of viable offspring in the first place , and DNA incompatibility in the sense of a butterfly with red and yellow stripes that ca n't hide among the yellow flowers , like her mom , nor among the red flowers , like her dad . This brings us to the most interesting thing I ever learned in a biology class . Those red and yellow butterflies with the striped daughter wasted a lot of calories making that daughter who is now certainly going to die very quickly . She has no viable camouflage , so she 's not gon na pass on any genes . The mom and dad would both have been better off if they had n't even had sex in the first place . That 's why complicated mating rituals evolve . They are a way to avoid making hybrids . Females evolve to abort a fetus which was fertilized with the wrong kind of sperm and reabsorb the nutrients and calories , or to avoid a male deer who does n't have exactly the right shape of horns , or to have a really weird shaped vagina that other species ca n't even have sex with if they tried , to avoid wasting energy on hybrids that are n't really adapted for any environment . So the high - level answer to \" why ca n't two different species have kids together \" is that the kid would be ill - adapted and worthless , a waste of calories , so animals evolve various mechanisms to kill them off before they 're even born , usually before they 're even conceived ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 297.33333333333337}

Since time immemorial sheep have been put on pasture in the mountains in the summer , with fences and cattle guards preventing them from going into the lowlands . One summer one sheep discovered she could cross the cattle guards by wiggling across on her back . Soon her flock were all doing it . What 's worse is that it gradually spread across the entire mountain . That fall they had to slaughter all the sheep from the mountain to contain this dangerous spread of knowledge . In addition , birds often immitate human sounds ( car alarms , etc ) and this tends to spread . EDIT : Oh , someone 's comment about whales and dolphins reminded me of one of the few inter - species examples of \" trends \" spreading ( highly recommend it ! ): URL_0", "I remember reading about a group of chimps where one chimp started a fad by sticking a twig behind his ear and wearing it around . Soon , all the other chimps were doing it too !", "Your question has to do with * culture * which is passing on of [ non - survival ] traditions or behaviours from one generation to the next through learning , observation , or teaching . It was first thought that only humans have culture , but through the extensive and exhaustive observational research conducted by primatologists across the world , we now understand that animals also have culture . \" Prior to these findings , opponents to the idea of animal culture had argued that the behaviors being called cultural were simply behaviors that had evolutionarily evolved due to their importance to survival . After the identification of this initial non - evolutionarily advantageous evidence of culture [ handclasp ] , scientists began to find differences in group behaviors or traditions in various groups of primates ... \" . As more species are studied , examples of social animals possessing culture have increased dramatically . * \" [ Kinji Imanishi ] ( URL_0 ) , first used the word with a prefix as the term \" pre - culture \" in referring to the now infamous [ potato - washing behavior ] ( URL_2 ) of Japanese macaques . \" \" Imanishi 's study was particularly revelatory because it traced a specific behavior , in this case the act of washing potatoes before eating them , from its origin as a novel invention through several generations of transmission . That remarkable potato - washing behavior was even adjusted and improved by the monkey culture as time went on , as they learned that washing their potatoes in salt water made them taste better . \" * \" ... Researchers McGrew and Tutin found a [ social grooming handclasp ] ( URL_3 ) behavior to be prevalent in a certain troop of chimpanzees in Tanzania , but not found in other groups nearby . This grooming behavior involved one chimpanzee taking hold of the hand of another and lifting it into the air , allowing the two to groom each other 's armpits . Though this would seem to make grooming of the armpits easier , the behavior actually has no apparent advantage . \" \" Today , more than 40 populations of chimpanzees have been thoroughly studied , and scientists have found at least 65 categories of behaviors that are culturally transmitted , including varied technology , communication , play , food gathering or eating methods , and social behavior . \" * \" ... Evidence for differing dialects among songbird populations has been discovered , especially in sparrows , starlings , and cowbirds . In these birds , scientists have found strong evidence for imitation - based learning , one of the main types of social learning . \" * \" Bottlenose dolphin , humpback whale , killer whale , and sperm whale songs and clicks are widely unique among different groups . In fact , researchers now acknowledge that these vocal differences are sufficient enough to be considered different dialects . Furthermore , different groups of some species , such as orcas , exhibit radically unique hunting techniques , and even diverse tastes in food , including the proclivity to hunt entirely different kinds of prey than other groups . \" [ More on culture in animals ] ( URL_1 )"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 291.0}

It's like a giant puzzle, and Marx was really good at figuring out some of the pieces. Here's what he thought:\n\n1. People are connected: Just like how you're connected to your friends and family, people in society are connected too. They work together, play together, and help each other out.\n2. Workers make the world go round: Everyone has to work to make things, like food, clothes, and toys. But some people, like bosses, get paid more than others just because they tell others what to do. That's not fair!\n3. The bosses have all the power: Imagine you're in charge of your own toy castle. You get to decide who can play with it, who has to clean it, and who gets to keep it safe. That's kind of like how bosses get to make decisions for everyone else in society. But that shouldn't happen, because everyone should have a say in how things go!\n4. We should all share the wealth: Just like how you share your toys with your friends, people in society should share the things they make together. That way, everyone can have what they need and no one has to be left out.\n5", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -0.37153440713882446}, {"text": "there",

is a lot of confusion with these terms , so let me give some very simple definitions to show how they are different : Feudalism - The means of production ( capital , usually land in this case ) are controlled by an aristocracy who are born into their social class and inherit capital from their parents . Laborers are serfs who have no control over capital and usually no political power . Capitalism - The means of production is controlled by the bourgeois , who can buy / sell / exchange their capital for other capital and goods . Laborers are the proletariat who sell their labor in exchange for money which they can use to buy capital and goods . Socialism - This is where things get hazy . In socialism the means of production are controlled by the state but owned by the people . What makes things tricky is that , in socialism , everyone has ownership of the means of production , so there are no proletariat and no bourgeois anymore , but there is still money and the exchange of labor for money . Socialism has never really existed . Communism - Marx himself never defined communism , but famously said that in communism a man could fish in the morning , write in the afternoon , and hunt in the evening . The idea is that there is a post - scarcity society . In other words , there is so much wealth that no one * * needs * * to work , but can choose to work whenever they want to get whatever they want . The closest thing to communism is what you see on Star Trek , esp . TNG . Marxism - This is a very strange term that really was created in the past 100 years to define people who believed in the ideal of communism . However , I think at its core everyone believes in communism -- just that right wingers think it is unnatural / impractical / impossible , which it honestly is at our current level of social and technological development . There 's a reason that Star Trek 's socio - economic and political structures were never controversial or attacked as communism -- the idea of no one ever needing to work appeals to nature 's desire for entropy .", "It 's always been rich against poor . Eventually , the poor call shenanigans on the rich and overthrow them . They will form a society to see that this never happens again , as people will have all necessities and comforts directly provided to them .", "I am not an expert , but since no one else has answered before , I 'll give a go . As I understand it , Marxism is really a theory of history , not exactly advocating anything ( though I believe he did think the ultimate stage was the best place to be ) . Basically , history will eventually cycle through a certain number of economic stages . The very first stage was the early years of human history ( maybe prehistory ... a long time ago , anyway ) before we formed governments and created money . This was \" primitive communism . \" We lived in a hunter - gatherer society and everything was shared . It ended once we created * * property . * * Not sure on the details of the other stages , but eventually we end up at capitalism , where the rich get richer and the poor are oppressed . Eventually , the proletariat ( working class ) will get fed up with the inequality in the system and rise up . They will create a * * dictatorship of the proletariat * * . This is basically what Leninism was supposed to be . * The proletariat takes control to seize the privileges of the bourgeois ( middle class ) and upper class and * * enforce equality * * . Eventually , though I 'm not sure how it 's supposed to happen , the government gets dissolved and property is completely eliminated . Basically , people live in a state of community where everything is shared . This is the final stage , * * stateless communism * * . Please , someone who is better informed tell me what I 've got wrong and what I 'm missing !"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 272.66666666666663}

That's right, just two! \nIt might seem strange, but 0 and 1 are special numbers that can be combined in different ways to make more numbers. Are you ready to learn about how we read and write binary numbers? 🤔\n\nLet's start with the basics. Imagine you have a toy box full of different colored rocks. Each rock represents a number, like how many fingers you have on one hand! 🤝\nIf you have two rocks, you have two numbers, like how many fingers on one hand times how many fingers on the other hand! 🤯\nThat's kind of like how we use 0s and 1s in binary. Each 0 or 1 is like a rock! \n\nNow, let's mix things up! 🎉 Instead of using rocks, imagine you have a toy machine that can make more rocks! 🤖\nYou can feed the machine different combinations of 0s and 1s, and it will spit out a different number! 😍 For example, if you put 2 ", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "W", "logprob": -0.6699843406677246}, {"text": "ow",

Think of how decimal works . When you get to ten , you start over . Binary is a bit like that , but you start over when you get to past 1 . Instead of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 you have : 0 1 10 11 110 111 Now ... That what i ve said above is pretty flawed and does nt really tell you much , but the way to work out what binary number represent is to think of it as a sign for doubling of everything . This is prolly beyond most 5 year olds , but lets pretend you are a really advanced 5 year old . Look at this number sequence . * * 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 * * ( if you use computers at all , say , have any idea how much ram you have had over the years , some of those numbers should look familiar yes ? ) okay , so lets list those numbers with some ones below them : 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 Now see how some numbers have 1 's below them , in this instance the : 2 , 4 , 16 , & 32 It 's as if we 've said , ' those numbers are on , the rest are off ' . So let 's add up the \" on \" numbers . 2 + 4 + 16 + 32 = 54 we 've just converted from binary to decimal : 01101100000 = 54 Now the higher up you go ( ie after 1024 is 2048 and then 4096 etc ) is how many bits the number is . ie a 64 bit system can store numbers wayyy exponentially larger than a 32 bit system , cos if you think , it 's not double the size , its a doubling of the previous bit lengths size . ( i m kinda rusty on all this and generalising , i wo nt go into any more detail , there;s better explanations and stuff i ve missed , but for a 5 year olds purposes that 's surely close enough ) Edit ... basically binary is needed in computers cos all computers are are really a series of switches . On , or Off . ie Current running thru it , or not . Hence 0 or 1 . Off , or On .", "A number like 123 is : 3 ones + 2 tens + 1 hundred The numbers get ten times bigger as you go up . 1 , 10 , 100 , 1000 .... Also , you can only make it out of numbers from 0 - 9 . 19 + 1 is 20 , not 1{10 } . In binary a number like 101 is : 1 one + 0 twos + 1 four The numbers get two times bigger as you go up . 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ... Also you can only make it out of numbers from 0 - 1 . 11 + 1 is 100 , not 12 . We chose a number system that goes up by tens because we have ten fingers . If we had two fingers , we might use binary in our everyday lives .", "Extremely simplified way of reading binary . Somebody better at explaining can probably write you up a more clear description on why this works , but eh ... this can get you started at least . Say you have the binary number 10001101 . Write down this table : Number : 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 Power : 2 ^ 7 2 ^ 6 2 ^ 5 2 ^ 4 2 ^ 3 2 ^ 2 2 ^ 1 2 ^ 0 Result : 128 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 141 Basically , you multiply each digit ( since binary , just 1 or 0 ) with the 2^x , x being the position of the digit read from right starting from 0 , and add all results together ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 285.33333333333337}

Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* The Treaty of Tripoli is a really important document that helps us understand how the United States and other countries should treat each other. But, you know what? It's not just about making friends with other countries! *winks* It also talks about religion.\n\nSo, you know how there are different religions in the world, like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism? Well, the Treaty of Tripoli says that the United States should be nice to all religions and not try to make one of them more important than the others. That means that the government can't force people to be a certain religion, and they can't say that one religion is better than another. It's like a big \"respect all religions\" pact! *high-fives*\n\nNow, you might be wondering what makes a religion \"acceptable.\" Well, that's a great question! The Treaty of Tripoli says that the United States should respect any religion that is \"professed\" by the people in that country. That means that if most people in a country want to be Christian, the government can't go around saying that Christianity is wrong and Muslims are right. It's all about treating everyone equally and respectfully.\n\nBut, wait, there's more! *exc", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "there",

Most laws or legal rulings regarding church and state relationship is based off of the 1st Amendment , which states : > * * Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof * * ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . In general , you are free to exercise your religious freedom however you 'd like in public ( assuming you do n't break other laws , like harming people ) . In general , the government can not endorse religion , which is why schools are n't allowed to institute moments of prayer .", "I like Mason11987 's reply , but I 'll go into a little more detail on the Treaty of Tripoli . Before we get to the actual Treaty , there is a clause of the US Constitution that we need to understand . This clause is known as the Supremacy Clause and it states , \" This Constitution , and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding . \" What this means is that if there is a federal law or treaty then that is the supreme law of the land and all the states must accept it . If a state has a law that contradicts the federal law than that state law is now moot . Nor can a state create a law that contradicts federal law . So now that we understand that a Treaty , properly ratified , is the supreme law of the United States , we can move on the to the actual Treaty of Tripoli , which states , in part , \" As the Government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion ... \" . A combination of this text from the Treaty and the Supremacy Clause technically mean that it is federal law that the US is not founded on the Christian religion . Now , a little context . This tidbit of history is just something that people point to whenever someone claims that the US is a christian nation . The likelihood that it would ever be used in a legal context is next to nothing as the First Amendment covers most conceivable religious / legal issues that may arise . However , that being said , it can be considered strong proof that the founders did not believe that the United States were founded upon the christian religion . The Treaty of Tripoli would have been read before the full Senate , which unanimously approved it , and then was signed by President John Adams . Also compelling is the fact that this happened in 1797 , only 14 years after the ratification of the Constitution .", "Both are good answers to the first question , but the second question is still , as far as I can tell , unanswered . Public displays of religion by private citizens not acting on behalf of a government institution is generally a - ok , providing that the speaker is n't inciting crimes or somehow physically forcing their religious views on others in one way or another . With public officials acting in an official capacity , it 's a little dicier . Invocations of faith are generally held to be unconstitutional , and there are a couple of decisions from lower courts to that effect ; I seem to remember one decision that banned a city council from inviting ministers to open meetings with prayer . Of course , the day 's business in Congress is regularly opened with a prayer or some sort of invocation ( which does n't make it legitimate or consitutional , I 'm just saying it happens ) ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 294.33333333333337}

The people of Iran wanted a change, and they wanted to have a government that listened to them and followed Islam.\n\nCan you imagine being a kid and having a toy that you really like, but your big brother gets to play with it all the time? That's kind of what it was like for the people of Iran before the revolution. They wanted a say in how their country was run and they wanted a government that followed Islam.\n\nOne day, a group of brave people called the Ayatollahs decided they wanted to make a change. They were like superheroes who wanted to save the country from the bad king and his friends! They were very wise and knowledgeable about Islam, and they wanted to make sure that the new government followed Islam.\n\nSo, they went on a big protest and said, \"Hey! We want to be in charge now!\" The king and his friends didn't like that, so they fought back. But the Ayatollahs were so brave and smart that they won!

["Oh , damn , this is VERY complicated , but here goes nothing . Iran used to be a absolute - ish monarchy , under control of the Shah , a term similar to emperor . The Shah ruled what is now Iran for centuries . He used to be a puppet ruler like in current monarchies until in 1953 they told then - prime minster Mossadegh to fuck off . This was the first event . Now we come to the 1970s , With Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in power . Remember , this is the Cold War , so , lots of comunnist / capitalist struggles for power in 3rd world countries , and Iran was one of them . So Reza Pahlavi was Pro - US all the way , and under his command Iran started a sort of modernization process , based mainly in western policies and abolishing some Islamic traditions such as banning women from voting , in which a lot of social , political , and economical aspects changed , and ( in the same way that other 3rd world countries managed this ) oppressed anyone who was considered an \" enemy \" ( mainly islamic leaders ) . Now add corruption and excessive use of force ( they had a secret police , SAVAK , that worked in a similar way that of the german stasi , or the chilean CNI . This was commonplace at the time . ) . You can see where this is going . This is when shit starts hitting the fan . The ( sometimes forceful ) introduction of american culture to Iran caused a sort of clash between it and islamic Culture . Muslims are pissed . Protests started popping in urban centers all over the country and ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ( which is in exile ) as the islamic leader . Shit happens ( lots of conflict here , too much for a reddit comment ) and in Februrary 3 , 1979 the Shah flees , never to return again . An islamic republic was installed and Khomeini ( who returned to Iran ) is declared the supreme religious leader . Welcome to modern day Iran . DISCLAIMER : since this happened within 50 years of the present time , it 's difficult to say completely objective things about this events . DISCLAMIER II : this has been MASSIVELY oversimplified but is what I found best suited for ELI5 . EDIT : thanks to /u / poopinbutt2k14 for Mossadegh . MEGA EDIT : Removed ISIS , I misunderstood the question at first . Also changed a few statements based on a comment by /u / iran - sza .", "Before the Islamic Revolution , Iran was a dictatorship run by the shah ( the Persian equivalent of an emperor ) . The shah 's regime was pretty unpopular for a variety of reasons . One was that the regime was put in place after a coup in 1953 that ousted the popular democratically - elected Prime Minister Mosadegh and installed the shah as a dictator whereas before he was becoming more of a figurehead monarch , like in the UK . This coup was carried out with significant American and British support , and was done to maintain British control of Iran 's vast oil resources , because Mosadegh had plans to nationalize the oil companies . The shah 's regime was also unpopular because it was undemocratic and there was a lack of civil rights and liberties , including political prisoners and extrajudicial executions . The ayatollah Ali Khomeini had lived in exile for a long time because of his opposition to the regime , but he was popular with Iranians and after the initial stages of the revolution in 1979 , he returned to Iran and was greeted as a hero . A new government was formed and Iran 's government is very complicated . It has some democracy , but it also has a \" Supreme Leader \" who is not elected .", "Just to be clear , Iran , formally the Islamic Republic of Iran , has nothing to do with the \" Islamic State \" ( aka ISIS / ISIL ) currently in Iraq and Syria . Iran is in fact a major regional enemy of the Islamic State , compounded by the fact the former is Shia and the latter is Sunni ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 271.0}

the ball crosses the end zone of the 100 yard field . this is worth 6 points , and afterward a team can kick the ball through goalposts for 1 more point , or try another play for 2 points . 2 ) a field goal- where the ball is kicked through the goal posts from the field . worth 3 points . the teams get to the end zone by gaining ground on the field . at the start of each offensive possession , a team has 4 tries to get the ball 10 yards . if they succeed , they get 4 more tries ( called \" downs \" ) to get 10 more yards , and so on until they fail , where the other team gets the ball , or score ( see above ) . The Purpose of the defense is to try and stop this , though defensive players can score a touchdown on an intercepted pass or fumble ( where a member of the offense drops the ball ) .", "I think every American guy has his own speech prepared in his head for this very question ..", "First off , scoring : Touchdown ( \" TD \" ): 6 pts . A team brings the football under control into the opponent 's end zone . Point - after attempt ( \" PAT \" ): 1 pt . Immediately following a TD , a team has the option to kick ( in the NFL ) an easy field goal through the posts . The ball starts at the opponent 2 yd line . 2 - point Conversion : 2 pts . Another option for the offense after scoring a TD . The offense must bring the ball under control into the opponent 's endzone , much like a touchdown . This also starts at the 2 yd line . Rarer than a PAT , as it is riskier . Field goal ( \" FG \" ): 3 pts . Similar to a PAT , but can be executed at any time by the offense . Safety : 2 pts . A ballcarrier is downed in his own endzone . The scoring team receives the kickoff afterwards - in all other scoring the scored - on team receives . These are very rare . There is also a maneuver called a dropkick but it has n't been executed successfully in nearly 70 years since being marginalized by the introduction of the FG . Gameplay : 4 quarters of 15:00 each . The clock runs except if on a previous down a player steps out of bounds , a pass is incompleted , a timeout is taken , the ball is spiked , or a penalty occurs . Setup : Two sides of 11 line up against eachother on a \" line of scrimmage \" determined generally by the last point of forward progress by the offense . The ball must be placed between two \" hashmarks \" each several yards inwards from their respective sidelines . This often results in more open play to one side of the ball . Offense : The team playing offense has 4 attempts or \" downs \" to move the ball at least ten yards ( or score ) from its initial placement on the first down . They may move the ball primarily by running or passing it . Forward passes must be thrown from behind the line of scrimmage . Defense : The defense must stop the forward progress of the offense by tackling ballcarrying players or legally interfering with passing . Turnovers : If the offense fails to attain a first down , the defense receives the ball . This often results in a punt by the offense on 4th down ( if they are out of range of a field goal ) in order to gain favorable field position . If a pass is caught by a defender , this is an interception . If a ballcarrier loses control of the football before he is legally \" downed \" he \" fumbles \" and either team may recover . The second two types of turnovers can swing the momentum of a game wildly ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 282.66666666666663}

So it is advisable to control and defend the land behind those walls so enemy troops ca n't slowly amass on your side of those walls . [ Russia has already lost the first line of buffer states , Poland , Czech republic , Slovakia , Hungary and Romania as their first line of countries as buffers after the Soviet Union broke up . ] ( URL_1 ) With those countries lost to NATO , an organization considers Russia as an adversary , and considered equally hostile by Russia , Russia effectively has lost most of the natural geographical defenses . Only Ukraine and Moldova sit behind those natural \" walls \" that are still not a part of NATO alliance . Moldova is however not aligned with Russia either . The last line of buffers are made up of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Belarus , and Ukraine . However here is even more grim for Russia . Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania all have joined NATO . However , their combined borders shared with Russia are small and can be defended effectively . Ukraine therefore holds a key strategic importance to Russia since She not only holds a key defensible spot right behind the Carpathian mountains , but her borders to Russia would not only open up a second front that Russia would have to defend from Europe , but also a very large border . So therefore , Russia 's ideal goal is to keep Ukraine from joining the EU and NATO , and prevent her from receiving western military bases , troops , and assets . However , Russia might not be able to prevent the entirety of Ukraine from joining NATO , so the next best thing , or the best of the worst outcomes , is to split Ukraine up , east and west , with the eastern Ukraine being aligned with Russia and act as a small , but still precious buffer space . * * TLDR : The walls around Russia are crumbling and being replaced by potential enemies . Ukraine is a huge chunk of that wall and Russia does n't want it to fall too . * * * edit , a better map *", "I assume that this is about the annexation of Crimea . In that regard , one of the explanations for Russia 's actions is that , historically , that region of the Ukraine actually belonged to Russia . This would go back to the USSR where the Soviet Union consisted of several different parts . In 1954 , Crimea was transferred to the Ukrainian part of the USSR as a \" symbolic gesture \" of Ukraine 's being a part of Russia . Many people considered this not a legitimate transfer , so when Ukraine separated from Russia after the USSR collapse , it took Crimea with it and many Russians were not satisfied . Many of the people in Crimea were \" ethnically Russian \" so there were a lot of people there who actually did want to become part of Russia again as well . Russians and Ukrainians did not get along very well , so there were lots of tensions . It could be said that Putin decided to \" bring back \" Crimea and the Russians living there . Many people would obviously not be convinced by this reasoning . There 's another explanation that Crimea lays in an important geographical location for Russia ( proximity to the Black Sea ) , and Putin used the ethnic trouble as an excuse to annex Crimea so he can further push exports of gas and oil . Bodies of water are important for this , since Russia can use them to bypass some of the other States when laying down pipes .

It's like when you play outside on a sunny day, and you might get a little sunburned if you stay outside too long. But, radation is different because it's not just the sun's light that can make you sick, it's the actual energy that the sun sends out.\n\nYou see, when radation enters your body, it can damage the cells inside you. It's like someone took a rubber band and stretched it really far, and then suddenly snapped it right back. Ouch! Your cells can get all messed up and stop working right, and that's when you start to feel sick.\n\nIt can make you feel tired, nauseous, and give you a headache. It can even make your skin feel like it's burning, or make your bones feel achy. It's like someone took your favorite toy and threw it away, and now you're left with a big ouchie.\n\nBut, the more radation you're exposed to, the more damage it can do.

["Radiation is made up of tiny particles . These tiny particles are so small that they can fly right through your body without stopping , but occasionally , they smack into one of your cells . Radiation particles are super - tiny , but so are cells , so sometimes , a particle can kill a cell . Sometimes , there 's a lot of particles , so a lot of cells die . But in fact , that is n't usually what kills you . What kills you is what happens next . Your body notices that there 's a bunch of dead cells , and it does n't know why they 're dead . But it suspects a virus , because that 's the usual culprit . Your body is wrong , but it does n't know that . So your body sends in its virus - killers , the white blood cells . Unfortunately , white blood cells have a hard time swimming through solid muscle . So your body makes it easier for these white blood cells to get to the dead cells by pumping up the muscles with extra water . That 's called \" inflammation . \" Unfortunately , if too many cells died from the particles , the body goes overboard . First , it pumps too much water into all your organs . Your organs ca n't handle all the water and they start malfunctioning . Then , at the same time , your body tells the white blood cells to get super - aggressive . The white blood cells lose track of friend - vs - foe , and they start wrecking the place . That 's \" acute radiation poisoning . \"", "Think of the radiation like tiny , tiny bullets . When you get radiation poisoning your bodies cells are getting hit by Billion of tiny bullets that go through your body . These bullets can damage things at the cellular level like DNA , causing it to break apart in the cell and killing the cell . These bullets can also break up alot of the molecules like hemoglobin , or hormones that your body needs . Not only does your body take damage but your body has to clean up the corpses of dead cells and the crazy new molecules that radiation has made .", "The main reason radiation kills your is because it can alter your protein structure and your DNA molecules . Now , radiation can come from a lot of different sources , but we will look at two cases , UV - Rays which comes naturally from the sun , and gamma rays which comes from nuclear reactions . UV - Rays will not penetrate a lot of things . In fact , most glass can probably block it very easily , which is why your windows gets so hot , even though all the visible light is coming through . Anyways , an UV - Ray , with an high enough energy level , can cause unwanted reaction in the cell . For example , if your cell there are DNA molecules in a very long chain , and if an UV - Ray happens to hit an important nucleotide of your DNA , such as in the promoter region , and it is not corrected , your DNA just got mutated . If you are exposed to more UV - Rays , and a large amount of DNA has being mutated , you can get cancer . Gamma Rays are essentially the same thing , but with much , much higher energies . If one of these photons hits your DNA , there is a sure chance that that DNA molecule will be changed or knocked off . And Gamma Rays needs very high density metals to block , unlike UV - Rays , which can be easily blocked for glass , and even some part of your dead skin . If you get a lot of Gamma Ray radiation , you are probably going to experience a lot of mutated DNAs , and when you have mutated DNAs all over your cells , you body can not function properly , and you will die . So basically , radiation gives your mutated DNA , which can cause cancer and can also destroy cell function , which will cause death ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 284.66666666666663}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nWhy is gentrification seen as a bad thing ? Is it just because most poor americans rent ? As a Brazilian , where the majority of people own their own home , I fail to see the downsides . Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Gentrification is a big word that means rich people are moving into a neighborhood and changing it. They might build new houses or businesses that are nicer than the old ones, but that can also make it harder for people who already live there to afford to stay.\n\nYou know how you have toys that you really like and want to keep playing with? Well, gentrification is a bit like someone coming and taking away your toys and giving you new ones that they think are better. But, just like how you might feel sad that your old toys are gone, people who live in the neighborhood can feel upset when their community changes.\n\nIt's not just because most poor Americans rent, although that is a part of it. It's also because rich people might come in and push up the prices of homes and apartments. That means the people who already live there might not be able to afford to live there anymore! They might have to move away to a different neighborhood that they can afford, but that neighborhood might not be as nice as the one they lived in before.\n\nIt's like a game of musical chairs, but instead of chairs, it's homes and neighborhoods! You want to keep the neighborhood you like and the people you know there, but sometimes things change and it's hard to stop that from happening.\n", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob":

people who live there . It involves making it so that rich(er ) people want to live there , driving up the prices of property and essentially pricing out the current residents so that they 're forced to move elsewhere . It 's the difference between saying \" let 's make the lives of the people living in this area better \" and saying \" this location is valuable , but the people are devaluing it . Let 's try to get different people in \" . Gentrification is often the later , at the expense of the people who live there . It does n't help anybody but those who pocket the profit Edit : For a little extra thought . What happens when you try to gentrify lots of places ? All of those residents have to move somewhere cheap . As they do , the options on where to move become smaller and smaller , which means you 're concentrating groups of people who were forced out of their homes into fewer areas . What do you think happens to the life of the people who are forced to move to areas of concentrated poverty ?", "Counterpoint : Gentrification is neither good , nor bad - its a byproduct of evolving economies and evolving lifestyle choices . It 's a * cyclical * process . Early in the cycle is seen as good . Usually artists , musicians , and young working professionals move to poor , crime - ridden neighborhoods . These neighborhoods also tend to have gang activity , drug issues , etc . The new people move in - make the area ' cool ' , * safe * , and invest in their surroundings . Maybe open new shops , maybe open a gallery or musicspace , etc . This is all good - and the area remains affordable . After a while , developers realize the potential of the neighborhood and the new demographic . The demand means they can now invest in better ( and more expensive ) housing options , new retail , office parks , etc . This is the best time in gentrification . Middle class folks start pouring in - but there 's still plenty of options for the poor ! The only people you 're evicting are squatters and druggies ( due to increased police presence ) Eventually - the demand for luxury housing grows . Developers latch onto this - buy out the lower - end households , make renovations , up the prices , and sell only to upper - class buyers . The middle class and poor are priced out and often need to find a new neighborhood to live in . This is sad . With the middle class , the artists and musicians gone - there are no more cultural beacons . Rich start moving away after some time because the neighborhood is no longer cool . Houses go on the market for a long time , noone wants to buy in an uncool neighborhood - prices drop , neighborhood falls apart , crime starts moving in , and the cycle happens all over all again . Sometimes the cycle lasts as short as a decade . Sometimes 50 years . Sometimes longer . I 've seen it go back and forth a few times growing up in my old city . Whatever the case - this is n't new . I 'm always surprised when people complain because the cycle should be * expected * . I 'm on the brink of being priced out of my neighborhood ( and there 's no rent control in my city ) - and I 'm not really upset . I 'm lower middle - class and I have my place in the cycle - and I 'll contribute what I can to my * next * neighborhood . Edit : I 'd like to extend my gratitude and thanks for whoever gave me gold ! YAY !", "It 's because as a neighborhood gentrifies , housing becomes more expensive which often means that some long - time residents can no longer afford to live there .

Forensic psychologists use their super cool detective skills to figure out really important stuff about criminals, like their favorite hobbies, the color of their car, and even the kinds of snacks they like to eat! 🤯\n\nYou know how you have a favorite toy or game that you love playing with? Well, forensic psychologists try to figure out what makes a criminal tick, like their favorite things to do, the kinds of friends they hang out with, and even the kinds of music they listen to! 🎵\n\nThey do this by asking the criminal lots of questions, like a really nice detective trying to solve a mystery. They want to learn everything they can about the criminal, like their personality, their thoughts, and their feelings. They might ask things like:\n\n* What do you like to do in your free time?\n* Do you have any hobbies or interests?\n* What kind of music do you listen to?\n* Who are your friends?\n* What kind of car do you drive?\n\nBy asking these questions, the forensic psychologists can start to build a picture of the criminal, like putting together a giant puzzle! 🤩 They use all the information they collect

Criminal profiling is a pretty controversial topic among professionals . For every criminal profile that is right there is usually one that is wrong . The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated . It does n't help that shows misrepresent what it is and how well is works .", "In certain situations , it may be possible to infer some psychological traits or characteristics of the criminal through profiling with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on factors such as who the targeted victim(s ) were , where the crime took place , what evidence was left at the crime scene , whether the crime scene was left neat / clean or messy / dirty , etc . The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology .", "Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific . For instance , if a murder is carried out \" military style \" , then they might surmise that the killer has military or law enforcement experience . If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a \" neater \" crime scene indicates someone who 's been at it for a while . The real misconception about profiling in terms of how it 's portrayed in popular culture , I think , is that it 's often shown as a more intuitive process , which only certain hyper - imaginative / hyper - empathetic individuals are able to carry out . This is where characters like Will Graham from the show \" Hannibal \" or Frank Black from \" Millennium \" come in , who are portrayed as having an almost quasi-(if not explicitly)psychic ability to \" see through the killer 's eyes \" or what have you ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 284.66666666666663}

real definition of what a hedge fund is , but the rough consensus is that it 's when rich investors pool their investment money together and use aggressive investment strategies to maximize the returns of the investments . Most well known being borrowing a lot of money from banks , several times what the total amount of money in the fund , as a way to amplify the strength of the investment money . But most hedge funds are secretive and do n't openly declare their strategies , to prevent competition . One of the key reasons why they are able to succeed with high returns is because they are unregulated , and can do crazy risky things that other funds ca n't . And they are unregulated because it 's assumed only crazy rich people who do n't mind losing their money would touch hedge funds .", "Imagine a private mutual fund that hides their strategies for investment That 's a hedge fund , and they hide their strategies because the market is efficient and if they 've found a model that actually beats the market , that is a secret worth keeping", "A hedge fund is an investment fund that uses hedging instruments to seek outsized returns . Hedging instruments are instruments that can be used to lower your risk . For example , if you are a farmer and you know you will produce 100 gallons of milk per day for the next year , you can pre - sell that milk on a futures or forwards market , thereby reducing your risk . This is called hedging . On the other side of your hedge might be a cheese manufacturer who wants to guarantee their input costs and therefore also hedge using futures contracts . Unfortunately , the amount of people who need to hedge do n't perfectly balance out . In come the speculators . These speculators take the other side of the deal allowing the counter - party to hedge . What 's more , the speculator is seeking a return while the hedger is seeking a guarantee , so often the speculator demands a price that favours them , allowing them to earn outsized returns . In this example , if we expect milk to sell at $ 100 next year , the farmer might be happy to lock in a price of $ 98 , which would give the speculator an expected $ 2 gain . In reality , they might end up owing $ 10 if the price ends up at $ 88 , but on average , they trade a good return for the farmer 's security . What 's more , the Hedge fund does n't have to put much money down to buy this contract , since all they are doing is making a promise to pay in the future . Futures , forwards , options , and leverage ( borrowing ) are the typical tools Hedge Funds use to speculate on the market and get exaggerated returns . Hedge funds buy or sell these in combination with the underlying asset ( in this example , milk , but more commonly , stocks or index funds ) to exaggerate the moves in the market . If they correctly bet on an asset increasing in value , they can get more than 10x the market return of simply buying the asset . Conversely , they can also fail miserably . They are high risk and for this reason , you are n't supposed to invest in them unless you are an accredited investor . We tend to believe that they are extremely successful because of survivorship bias . For example , if you look at any hedge fund that exists today and you ask how much they made over the last ten years , almost all of them did extremely well . The reason of course is that the hedge funds that did badly over the recession no longer exist and wo n't be part of your database . Hedge funds fail more frequently than any other kind of fund but also can give better returns than any other kind of fund when they succeed ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 272.0}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow did pirates / navy track down other ships back before radar / sonar ? I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ? It 's not possible to track steps through ocean . Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Arrrr, tracking down other ships was a bit of a tricky business back in the olden days before radar and sonar, matey! Let me tell ye how pirates and navies used to do it.\n\nBefore radar, navies and pirates used to rely on their eyes and ears to find other ships. They'd look for signs of smoke on the horizon, which meant there might be a ship cooking up some grub nearby. They'd also listen for the sound of waves and wind, which could give them clues about the direction and speed of the other ship. It's kind of like how you might hear a bird chirping and know that it's close by!\n\nAnother trick they'd use was lookout duty. That means they'd send someone up to the crow's nest (a high place on the ship) to scour the horizon for any sign of other ships. It's kind of like how you might stand on the shore and look out to sea for dolphins or whales.\n\nIf they did find another ship, they'd try to figure out which way it was going by observing its sails and the direction of the wind. It's kind of like how you might see a plane flying overhead and guess which direction it's going by looking at the shape of its wings.\n\nIf the other ship was too far away", "completions_tokens":

But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .", "The ocean is endless but interesting places are not . I 'll assume here that the sail is n't on the horizon and we 're starting from scratch . Write a letter to everyone you know to every possible port and ship your target might encounter . Then make copies . Leave the letters for the packets to pick up . Packets were small , robust , but fairly fast ships that were the stagecoaches of the day . Part bus , part mail service , and always smelly and cramped . The packets would run a route picking up your letters and dropping them off at the destinations . Some packets would n't make it or the mail would simply be destroyed enroute . Which is why you made copies . Other times the packet would leave a letter in every port intended for a specific ship . Which is why you made copies . With luck and few weeks or a few months later the letters would be read . Your friends write back and describe the condition of the ship , where it was seen , and what activity it may be up to . Which you 'll read weeks or months later . However now you have a reasonable idea where to start the search . If the ship has weed on the hull then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's rigging is old and frayed then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's sails are thin and patched then it will be slow and easier to catch . So now you have an estimate of the speed . Then does the ship have enough water ? Is the ship using gunpowder excessively or conservatively ? Now you can start to guess how well supplied the ship is . This gives an idea of intent . Once the search region is known then it 's all about guessing where the ship will head next . Does the ship head for fresh water ? Does the ship head to a port for food or supplies ? Does the ship head to sea for mischief ? There are only so many interesting places to go . The most direct routes between these places form routes . Guess the destination and either get there first or attempt to intercept the ship at sea between destinations . Wait for days or weeks . Guess right and the sail should appear on the horizon . Now the chase begins . The winner is the faster ship or the one that does n't make the mistake . Luck , such as with the weather gauge , plays a huge factor on who chases whom . Guess wrong and spend the next few weeks or months repeating the process .", "Trade routes . Highways on the sea .

"answers": ["It works like this : Anti - matter is like the opposite end of a magnet , it has the exact opposite charge of an atom . So the protons which are usually + are now - , and the electrons that are normally - are now + . The problem with anti - matter is that it does n't really belong in our universe ( there could be other universes in the multiverse made entirely of anti - matter ) . So , when an anti - matter atom comes into contact with any regular atom , they cancel out in an explosion . Anti - matter is very very expensive to manufacture , and we can only make a few atoms at a time . If we could create a teaspoon of anti - matter , it would bankrupt every country of the world . ( Reply to this if you want me to explain how anti - matter is made ) EDIT : Well for the anti - protons , they have to take atoms and collide them at near - light speeds , and very seldom they get an anti - proton ( which must be handled with great care due to its explosive nature ) . Anti - electrons , or positrons , they are naturally emitted by the sodium-22 ion . They just pair them together and you have anti - matter . EDIT 2 : It has been theorized that anti - matter is actually matter flowing against time ( i.e. going backwards in time ) and that is the reason why the antimatter - matter explosions are so large is because they are cancelling each other out of the time stream . Dark matter on the other hand is matter that does not have any physical form , but we know it exists because we have detected gravity where it is . Gravity is much like a tarp . If you put a heavy object on it ( like a sun ) it will bend , and other objects on the tarp will circle it ( planets ) because it creates such a dip . But with that , you can see that the sun is causing the entire tarp to dip . With dark matter , it appears as if the tarp is dipping by some invisible force . There are several theories about this , but the most predominant one is that dark matter is actually matter from other universes in the multiverse that are in different dimensions . More to the point , gravity has an easier time bleeding through dimensions ( imagine the dimensions as pieces of paper on top of each other ) , and that 's why a great deal of our universe is filled with dark matter . Hope that helps .", "Anti matter is similar to normal matter , except the charges of each particle within the atom is reversed . As for dark matter , your guess is good as mine . Nobody can say for sure what exactly dark matter is since we have n't been able to get a good observation or test sample of it . Dark matter is basically code word for \" we have no idea what this is , but it 's there . \"", "On dark matter : First , there are two kinds of dark matter . There is ordinary dark matter and extraordinary dark matter . Ordinary dark matter is just regular matter that we ca n't see . Planets orbiting other stars are ordinary dark matter . We know they exist because of the the effects they have on their stars . So , ordinary dark matter is just any matter that is either too small , too far away , or does n't put out enough light for us to pick up with our telescopes . Extraordinary dark matter , on the other hand , we do n't know about . We just have guesses . We know ordinary dark matter exists ; however , extraordinary dark matter may not . The other possibility is that our current theory of gravity does n't work the same when applied to a system as large as a galaxy . Edit : Commas ? How do they work ?"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 266.66666666666663}

Each of them do different things . Some of them , like serotonin and norepinephrine , make you happy .

If no one ever got sad , they would have high levels of energy even when they should be withdrawing to think about their lives . Depression happens when the sadness does n't go away , and people become unable to prepare for new courses of action . They start to become numb and entirely withdraw from the world around them . The sadness that was initially good takes over their lives . Some people are more likely to stay sad than others because they lack certain chemicals in their brain . Other people are more likely to stay sad because they had so many bad things happen to them that they ca n't get past their big sadness . Some people can help get over their sadness by talking to a person called a \" therapist . \" Therapists are really good listeners and help people talk through their sadness instead of hiding from it like many people try to do .

Here's why:\n\n1. Taxes, taxes, and more taxes! *grumbles* The British government wanted to make money from the colonies, so they imposed lots of taxes on things like stamps, sugar, and tea. The colonists felt this was unfair because they didn't have representatives in the British parliament to speak for them. They didn't want to pay taxes without having a say in how the money was spent.\n2. Slaves, slavery, and more slavery! *stares* The British colonizers owned slaves, and the colonists were divided on the issue. Some colonists thought slavery was bad and wanted it to end, while others thought it was okay and wanted it to continue. The British government tried to enforce some laws that would help end slavery, but the colonists didn't like it. They felt the British were telling them what to do and trying to change their way of life.\n3.

We were taxing the New World folks up the wazoo , and they had no representation in Parliament in return for all that tax . The people of the States therefore did what they knew would really piss off the Brits - they chucked a load of tea into the Boston Harbour . The British authorities saw through the Native American disguises the terrorists / freedom fighters were wearing and the whole thing escalated into the Revolutionary War following the 13 states ' Declaration of Independence . The Colonists did n't decide on war with the British , war was thrust upon them when the Redcoats arrived to suppress the revolt .", "Many of the colonists , or their ancestors left Britain to get away from religious laws . Starting with the Puritans and Quakers . So there is already a ready made population with anti - government sentiment . Add to that the frontier mentality that if a person did n't like laws and control he just went west and started a new farm out of sight of the authorities . When government does happen in the colonies it tends to be small and local not driven from overseas . Then the French and Indian War happens . Britain spends an extraordinary amount of money protecting the colonists from their enemies . Those colonists are developing larger and larger towns and cities and expect the Crown to protect them not just do it themselves any more . The frontier mentality is being lost in the cities and towns . In response after the war the British government does several things which basically pisses off every colonist possible . First they establish the Proclamation line of 1763 . No settlement west of the Appalachians , that is now reserved for the Indians . No more running from the authorities by going west . And as the colonist see it setting up a place the Indians can gather and prepare to attack them in peace . This pisses of all the frontier minded people , and all those who chafe under government control . Second they decide its time the colonists paid for some of the defense that has already been provided in the war , and will be provided in the future . They impose various taxes on goods : The Tea Act , The Stamp Act and restrictions on how trade is conducted . This pisses off the merchants in the cities and those who in the past would flee west ca n't anymore and stay in the east as dissenters . Third the colonists are given no say in these policies . Not only will the government in England impose unwanted regulations you do n't get a vote or even the right to complain . That privilege is reserved for people in Great Britain . Now as dissent and unrest increase the British use the army now stationed in the colonies to stop it . They send out raids into the countryside to seize guns and powder . They garrison the worst of the cities not paying the taxes , and they impose more taxes to pay for this further angering the colonists . Its a downward spiral . The more the colonists resit the stronger the British clamp down which causes the colonists to resit more . All the while the British do n't even consider letting the colonists have a say in determining real policy for the colonies . In truth the taxes were not that bad . They were less than someone in GB could be expected to pay . But they were on a non - compliant population used to no taxes who did n't understand why they needed to pay them , and felt that without representation which they were used to locally they were just unfair . Better to go back to the way it was with just locals in charge ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 295.0}

Let me tell you something really cool about how people talk! 🤔\n\nYou know how some people have funny sounds or words when they speak? Like how some people say \"ah\" instead of \"eh\" or how some people say \"y'all\" instead of \"you guys\"? That's called an accent! 🤝\n\nAn accent is like a special way that a person talks that is different from how other people talk in their language. It's like a unique fingerprint of how they sound when they speak. 🎨\n\nNow, the reason why people have accents is because they grow up hearing and using language in a certain way. Like, maybe you grew up listening to your mom and dad talk, and you learned how to talk by copying what they sound like! 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\nIt's kind of like how you might learn to play a game by watching someone else play it before you do. Your brain just takes in all the sounds and words and patterns that you hear, and it helps you figure out how to make them yourself. 🤔\n\nBut, sometimes, people can be a little bit confused because they hear different accents when they speak with other people.

That s how we fake accents . It of course requires a conscious effort to stop reverting back .", "Good question ! First off , accents are often solely based on geographical factors . In America , for example , accents in the south tend to have a \" drawl , \" where words are accented in different places . Compared to their northern counterparts , who tend to speak with word accents in their dictionary defined areas , there 's a night and day difference . You may be thinking , \" well , that 's all fine and good , but where did these accents come in the first place ? Why do n't we all speak with the same accent ? \" The answers to these questions can be specifically attributed to the evolution of a language . Sticking with English here . English itself is typically said to have three stages , Early English , Middle English , and Modern English . Geoffrey Chaucer , a poet in the 14th and 15th centuries , wrote his English in a manner we would scarcely be able to discern in modern day English . This is important because Chaucer 's English is still categorized as modern English . This passage from his Canterbury Tales shows just how different the language has come in a few hundred years . Whan that Aprill , with his shoures soote The droghte of March hath perced to the roote It 's important to factor culture into this discussion , since culture is the main reason why language evolves . Words like ' troll ' , ' booty ' , and ' YOLO ' , have all derived from modern day pop culture . In the past , language changed almost exclusively due to literature . It 's said Shakespeare alone contributed 1700 unique words to the English language . From there , certain factors such as literacy , socio - economic status , and even certain health issues all contribute to language , and as consequence affect accents . Over time , as populations migrate and collect in dense areas , these factors blend and transform into new accents . The reason why you see a stark difference between the south US and northern US is due to who primarily settled there . In the south you had rich landowners , who , to separate themselves from the rest of the population , brought their \" proper \" language with them from Europe . This , mixed with the many African dialects that came over in early America , has evolved into what we hear today . Merchant class citizens typically settled in the north . Later Scandinavian influence ( especially in the midwest ) has evolved into what we hear today . As for changing accents ... You actually can and will develop a new accent over time if you find yourself among a population who has a completely different accent to you . I 'm a Minnesotan . We typically have a very recognizable accent in that we often pronounce our ' o 's with a long syllable . When I visit family from as close as Indiana I notice my accent starts to change ever so slightly to have more of that drawl . Spend enough time around different accents , and your accent will change . TL;DR Accents and languages have their own evolution . Social factors have a huge impact on why we speak the way we speak . Edit : Sorry about the formatting ... I 'll try to fix it later . Stupid mobile . Edit 2 : I realize this is n't necessarily ELI5 , but I hope it helps .", "Let 's take English .

Protestants think that every individual Christian has a direct connection to God, and they can pray and read the Bible on their own. Orthodox Christians believe that the church is like a big family, and they have priests and bishops who help them connect with God. Catholic Christians also have priests and bishops, but they think that the church is like a big mommy who takes care of them and helps them connect with God.\n\nAnother difference is in their beliefs about sacraments. Protestants don't have sacraments like Orthodox and Catholic Christians do. Sacraments are special rituals that help them connect with God, like baptism and communion.\n\nNow, do they use different Bibles? Sort of! Protestants use the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, while Orthodox Christians use the Greek and Latin versions. Catholic Christians use the KJV too, but they also have some extra books that the other two groups don't have.\n\nSo, how would you tell them apart? Well, you could look at their buildings!

The Protestant Churches first started to break off during the Reformation ( or Protestant Reformation ) that started as an attempt to correct the corruptions of the Catholic Church that failed and so broke away from the Church no longer recognizing the Pope as an authority .

The Orthodox church sepearated from the Catholic church in the 11th century .

Unless they 're panicking over something external , most people having a panic attack mistake it for a heart attack . Tingling in extremities , rapid heartbeat ( caused by all that fast breathing ) and so on . Try putting on a metronome ( you can get apps for a smartphone ) to help whoever 's panicking get a sense of time passing . When you 're panicking , your brain starts perceiving everything faster and time slows down . This will also help regulate their breathing . A good pace for breathing is 4 - 7 - 8 : in for four , hold for seven , out for eight .", "I am not a doctor . This is not medical advice , but I have lived with three different people prone to panic attacks and learned this that way : * * What happens during a panic attack * * ( Please note : there may be other things at play : this is the \" what happens \" that I know about , and I believe is most common , as I know several people who suffered from these . ) A panic attack is triggered by something - often specific to the person suffering , or sometimes they just happen on their own . The panic response ( in everyone ) triggers heavy breathing to get as much oxygen into the blood as possible ready for a fight - or - flight response . However , in a panic attack this heavy breathing ( hyperventilating ) is overdone , and it actually makes it harder to breath . The sensation of not being able to breath causes new waves of panic , and so it continues . * * What you can do * * Firstly , do not panic yourself . The first time I saw someone have a panic attack I thought she was choking on someone , and started trying to hit her on the back . That was n't so helpful , as it turned out . You should be the paragon of calm . A panic attack is not dangerous . If someone really overdoes the hyperventilating they will trigger a \" breathing reset \" sort of thing , which sorts out their breathing and they quickly calm down . Even if this does n't happen ( which I 've never known to happen ) the worst that can happen is that they 'll fall asleep , but anyway . Secondly , be comforting . One person I knew who was prone to them had flashbacks to a traumatic event that triggered her . By hugging her closely , and talking to her I 'd override her flashback - senses with real - world - here - and - now senses and bring her out of the flashback and she 'd calm down quickly . To her I said things like \" You 're okay , you 're safe . You 're here with me now . Look at me , nothing here can hurt you ... \" etc ... Another person I knew had more random ones . With her I 'd do the same , but try to get her to focus on deep breaths . With a third person I tried the deep breaths thing , but she said it only made her want to punch me , only she was too deep into panic mode to do so . With her I 'd just hold her , try to say calming things and use the tightness of my grip ( tighter , gentler , etc ... ) to try to subtly adjust her breathing and found that worked . Thirdly , talk to them . Some people do n't like talking about it , but you can talk about how to help them . This means you find out what makes certain people want to punch you , or useful things like the \" bring them out of flashbacks \" and stuff .", "Deep breaths to ten and back . The key is to be rational regardless of their behavior ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 294.66666666666663}

They're like a memory of the thing that hurt you, and they can stay on your skin forever. *wide eyes* It's like your skin is trying to tell everyone, \"Hey, I got hurt here!\"\n\nBut, sometimes, scars don't go away, and they stay on your skin for a really long time. *frowning* This is because your skin is trying to fix the hurt, but it can't always fix it perfectly. It's like trying to put a Band-Aid on a really big cut – it can help, but it can't make the cut go away completely.\n\nSo, that's why scars don't always heal completely.

hole in your teddy bear . Your skin is like the fabric . Once you cut it , you 're not able to put it back together perfectly . A scar is like the little bumpy sewing line . Now why do n't you go watch Spongebob , so mommy can finish her glass of silly juice ... sorry it 's getting too real . EDIT : I kind of skirted your question . They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres . It forms quickly and \" good enough \" to cover the wound and hold the tissue together .", "You can try cold welding it in a 100 % vacuum ...", "Okay I 've never tried this & it 's been a while since my medical devices course but here 's a quick rundown . Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) . TL : DR Body undergoes regeneration and replacement , scar tissue replaces cells that the body ca n't regenerate or grow back fast enough to prevent any further damage to the system . This was probably a horrible explanation . Sorry if it was n't clear ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 263.33333333333337}

Should n't artists be entitled to distribute how they want and charge what they feel is appropriate ? Edit : To clarify , why is piracy considered okay by the internet community at large ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Let's talk about piracy and copyright laws on the internet. See, artists make stuff like music, movies, and books, and they want to be able to control how those things are shared and used. That's where copyright laws come in. They give artists the power to say who can share their work and how much they can charge for it.\n\nNow, some people might think that artists should be able to do whatever they want with their work, like giving it away for free or charging whatever they feel like. But here's the thing: if everyone did that, the artists might not be able to make a living off their work! They need to be able to control how their work is shared and used so they can continue to make more stuff for us to enjoy.\n\nThat's where piracy comes in. Piracy is when someone takes someone else's work without permission and shares it without paying for it. It's like if you drew a picture of your favorite superhero and decided to give it away for free instead of asking your friend if they could borrow it. It's not cool, and it's not fair to the person who made the picture.\n\nThat's why it's important to respect copyright laws and to ask for permission before sharing someone else's work.

ok , but it is a consequence of marketing and pricing . There is no justifying it , but there is some explanation of it . With saturation advertising , there 's literally almost no direction I can look , right now , where I 'm sitting , and not see an advertisement for digital media . The whole point is the advertisers want you to feel that you want this product and you want it * now * , in order to induce a purchase . And they 're successful , at large , too successful , actually . The value of media is inflated , music and video is n't actually worth what they 're charging , as evidenced by the rampant piracy . The working class has n't had a pay raise in 22 years and has less buying power now than they did in the 1980s , cost of living increases , and the price of media has always been ~$15 for an album . And you get less today than ever . You used to get a cover , an insert , and art , bundled with the album . Today , you get an mp3 download . It costs fractions of a penny to digitize the final product and distribute it on the internet , you 'd think that would drop the price . It costs $ 0.017 to produce a CD , just as a point of reference , and digital distribution is orders of magnitude cheaper . So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it . The way the industry works is an artist is contracted to produce content for the publisher , they do n't own their own songs , and they 're literally lucky if they get any money , at all , from the sale of their media . Artists make money by performing , and even then , they 're responsible for the cost of the production , which cuts into their profits . So publishers are seen as big , bad , rich , faceless corporations - profiteering gluttons who do n't need any more money for something they own but they did n't make , so fuck em ' , right ? The world is such a big place and so many people do buy the album that they wo n't even notice I stole a copy ... Or so the mindset goes . There are scenarios where people do pay , when they feel the price is fair and when they feel the profits are distributed to those whom they see entitled .", "Once upon a time ( like 15 years ago ) , media companies did n't offer people a way to use music / movies on computers or other devices , and there was a large group of younger , tech - savvy people who really wanted to do so . Since the media producers did n't offer any way to do it legally , consumers turned to illegal ways to create / use / distribute media , and justified it by saying that there was no other way . Media companies have come around , and now you can get just about any content in digital format . However , many people who grew up in the \" piracy or nothing \" era feel entitled to \" free \" media , and this attitude has been adopted as a convenient way for other people to not feel bad about pirating content .", "It 's considered OK because people like their free stuff and they 're willing to do mental gymnastics in order to justify their actions . It really is immoral to just download content without compensating the creator . There is something of an exception when it 's not reasonably possible to buy the content through normal channels , and definitely an exception when you already purchased the content in a different format , and just need a particular format you ca n't convert to on your own ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 295.33333333333337}

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Oh, great! *excited squeal* You wanna know a cool secret? 😍 When you delete something on your device, like a file or a message, it's actually not just \"farted out\" into thin air! 😆 Here's what happens:\n\n1. Your device stores all your files and data in special places called \"memory.\" Think of it like a big box where you keep all your toys.\n2. When you delete something, like a toy car, the device removes the information about that toy car from its memory box. It's like taking the toy car out of the box and putting it in a special place called the \"Recycle Bin.\" 🛍️\n3. The Recycle Bin is a temporary place where the device stores deleted files until it's ready to get rid of them for good. It's kind of like a toy car graveyard! 😳\n4. Sometimes, the device will automatically move the deleted files to the Recycle Bin after you've deleted them. Other times, you might need to empty the Recycle Bin to make room for new toys (files). 🚀\n5. Once the deleted files have been in the Recycle Bin for a while, the device will usually overwrite them with new data.

The device only deletes the access information and now says the actual files are blank space , in reality they are still there . Until , you add new files that use that same space . With certain programs you can still access all those pics , videos , and docs you thought you deleted . If you keep lots of blank space on your device , chances are everything is still there . If you are constantly having to delete files to make room for more , those files may actually be gone .", "# # What is a File System ? Imagine your computer as a recipe book . It contains sections , such as \" * Cakes * \" , \" * Soups * \" or * \" Stews * \" which represent directories , and within each section are individual recipes , which represent the files on your computer . So you have a list of sections ( directories ) each of which contains a list of recipes ( files ) . The contents page contains a table which tells you on which page you can find each section and each individual recipe . This is like your file system , which is essentially a big table which tells the operating system on which part of the disk it can find each directory and file . With a recipe book , you can easily flick through the book to find things without looking through the contents , but on a computer that 's quite a bit harder because there are so many files : often hundreds of thousands or even millions on a single system . So on a computer , the file system is , for all intents and purposes , the only way to find files and directories . The act of * formatting * a disk with a specific file system is what actually creates a file system , which is like an empty contents table . It gives you a place where you can insert your recipes ( files ) and sections ( directories ) . ---- # # Deleting files What happens when you delete a file or a directory on a computer is that the entry in the file system is simply removed . It 's like just crossing out the entry for an individual recipe in the contents page of the recipe book . Notice that the actual recipe is still in the book , and you can still find it if you scan through the book looking for it . This is how undelete programs are able to recover deleted files ; they can search for the file on the disk and re - insert the entry back into the file system just like re - adding an entry for a recipe back into the contents table . So you 've removed the entry for a recipe from the contents , but what happens to the actual page on which your deleted recipe resides ? Well , the recipe is still on it , but it 's considered to be a free page now . This is where the analogy kind of breaks down , because obviously pages in a book ca n't just be written over , but parts of a disk can be . So a part of the disk containing the contents of a file which no longer has no entry in the file system is considered free to use . It 's just data that no longer belongs to anything . When you want to create a new file , that piece of the disk can be reused and new data can be written to it . --- # # Secure Deletion Secure delete programs will actually attempt to overwrite the data on the disk before removing the entry from the file system . In actual fact , this does n't always work because when you write new data to a file , it does n't necessarily reuse the same location on the disk , but that 's another topic entirely ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 290.0}

Each magical mailman only knows the address of the person they're sending the letter to, and not the actual person who sent it! *mind blown*\n\nThat's what Tor nodes do – they help keep you anonymous online.

The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)", "Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .", "TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it . So , unless every single TOR node in a configuration is corrupted you can be sure that your identity is hidden ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 271.33333333333337}

Space shuttles and other rockets don't use nuclear energy because... 🤔 *wait for it* ...it's actually not that simple! 😅\n\nFirstly, space is a really, really big place. Like, REALLY big! 🤯 It's so big that it can take a spacecraft a long time to get to other planets, and it needs a lot of power to do that. Nuclear energy, while super powerful, isn't enough to power a spacecraft all the way to another planet. 🚀\n\nSecondly, space is also really, really cold! 🥶 Like, colder than your favorite winter jacket! 😬 And, did you know that nuclear reactors don't work as well in really low temperatures? 🤯 So, if a spacecraft was to use nuclear energy, it would probably not be as efficient or safe.

Nuclear Thermal Rocket ] ( URL_1 ) , but it still needs other \" fuel \" , not only radioactive elements . here are other projects : URL_0", "It 's true that nuclear reactions tend to output greater energy over time than chemical ones , but chemical ones are far easier to engineer . When it comes to getting a payload into orbit , you need enough thrust to not only push your cargo into space , but also the engines and the fuel . This is the paradox of rocket science . More fuel and bigger engines mean you can go further , but also means you need more fuel and bigger engines to lift them in the first place . A nuclear reactor of any kind is a complex , heavy and cumbersome thing , certainly when compared to a ( relatively ) simple oxygen / hydrogen / kerosene ignition system . Ultimately , it 's just easier to get the required lift and speed from burning some chemicals together than it is from heating hydrogen and expelling it at high speed as would be done in a nuclear rocket . The alternative , a nuclear pulse rocket , has huge drawbacks in terms of its waste products ( see below ) . Also , consider the safety aspects . When a chemical rocket explodes - as they have a tendancy to do now and then - you 're left with a big fire , some debris and maybe some unpleasant and hazardous materials from burning plastics / metals . If a nuclear reactor expodes mid - air , you 've then got radioactive material being dispersed over a wide area . ( Consider that the Columbus disaster had wrekage spread over hundreds of square miles ) . There would n't be any nuclear detonations , the design of a nucelar reactor does n't work on the same principle as a bomb , but you would have the same or comparable fallout effects .", "There 's actually been quite a bit of work on this ! [ Project Orion ] ( URL_2 ) was one of the earliest ones . NASA is currently thinking [ fusion ] ( URL_4 ) power , but that 's hard since we ca n't yet produce a net - energy - positive fusion reaction on Earth , let alone in a rocket . NASA is also looking at [ thermonuclear ] ( URL_3 ) propulsion for a future trip to Mars . Their [ Design Reference Architecture ] ( URL_1 ) has a LOT of info on the specs for any proposed reactors . There were a bunch of prototypes made by the USSR and a couple by the US ; some even [ launched ] ( URL_0 ) during the Cold War . One of the biggest challenges is that you do n't want the reactor to be what breaks you out of the atmosphere . It could potentially cause a lot of radiation exposure if anything went wrong . This is where SNAP-10A had its problems . That means you have to remotely start a brand new reactor in space , in addition to being able to reliably control it . To get the rocket out of the atmosphere , you 'd need a detachable stage with traditional propulsion engines . The biggest advantage of using nuclear propulsion is that it is much lighter than current propulsion systems , which means you can accelerate more and go faster . At that point , efficiency does n't matter as much . I 'm not sure on cost of building a nuclear - powered rocket . The up - front cost of researching and testing would be much greater than continuing to use traditional means , which is the biggest barrier to implementing thermonuclear rockets .

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Let me tell you a cool thing about how capital cities are chosen! 🤔\n\nSo, you know how there are different places called states, provinces, or countries? Well, the leaders of each one need a special place to live and work, kind of like how you have a bedroom in your house! 🏠 This special place is called the capital city! 🏙️\n\nHow are capital cities chosen? Well, it's kind of like a game where everyone gets to pick their favorite place! 🎮 The leaders of the state, province, or country talk about where they think the capital city should be, and they vote on it. Sometimes, the government decides where the capital city should be, but other times, they ask the people what they think! 🗳️\n\nCan the capital city change? Oh, yeah! Sometimes, the leaders of the state, province, or country decide that they want to move the capital city to a different place. This happens for a lot of reasons, like if they want to be closer to a river for trade or if they want to be in the center of the state, province, or country.

Originally , the capital of the US was New York City . This angered the agrarian types since New York was the business center of the country . Thomas Jefferson in particular did n't like New York as the capital . So one day Alexander Hamilton , the secretary of the treasury approached George Washington about paying off the country 's debts from the Revolutionary War . Washington told him to talk to Jefferson , the secretary of state . Jefferson proffered that he 'd help Hamilton if Hamilton agreed to move the capital to somewhere near Virginia . Hamilton agreed and now the capital is Washington , DC .", "Generally the legislature decides , and when they do , it 's generally based on geography . And yes , the absolutely can change , it 's just not as common nowadays . For example , I 'll take you through the history of Georgia 's capitals ( since I live here ) . Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto \" capital \" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n't amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise . So the decision was pretty easy to make , and Atlanta 's served as capital of the state ever since . TL;DR : It 's the legislature deciding where to put the capital , and they can change relatively simply . They just do n't tend to anymore .", "There 's a whole load of explanations for why a city ends up being the capital of a country . It 's not necessarily because it was explicitly chosen . For example the Roman empire started out as a the city state of Rome . So naturally Rome was the capital of the empire . And when Italy finally unified again in the 19th Century , it made sense to make Rome the capital again . A lot of old countries do n't have a process for choosing a capital city , because it has \" always \" been where it is . But in theory if they did want to move the main political institutions to another city the country 's government could choose to do so ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 283.33333333333337}

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Let me tell you a secret: 2 liters of 100% pure orange juice might cost around $4, but it's actually a lot more expensive to make than you think! *winks*\n\nYou see, oranges are grown on trees, and they're pretty hard to squeeze by yourself. It takes a lot of work and special equipment to get the juice out of them. Professional juice extractors are really good at doing this, but they're also really expensive! *nods*\n\nSo, when you buy 2 liters of orange juice from the store, the company that makes it has already paid for all the costs of growing, picking, and juicing the oranges. They also have to pay people to do the work, like farmers who grow the oranges and factory workers who turn them into juice. All of these costs add up, and that's why it's expensive! *takes a sip*\n\nBut, here's the catch! You don't have to do any of the work yourself. *grins* If you buy oranges and use a juicer at home, you have to pay for everything yourself, like buying the oranges, the juicer, and the time you use it.

So I worked for a while in produce in a large supermarket as a young inquisitive school kid . The produce manager was a wise old man who had dealt with that job longer than I 've been alive . To pass the time i would ask him about lots of things we came across . Partially to test him and see if he knew , mostly because he almost always knew and the answers were interesting . We did a big citrus sale every year . After loading , stacking , checking dates and sources , rotating , and shelving near a ton of assorted oranges and other similar citrus , I noticed one thing . None of it was from Florida ! Thinking I finally had a question to stump the boss man , I asked him . \" Why do n't we sell any oranges from Florida ? \" \" We do . \" \" No way . Every box I checked today was from someplace other than Florida . \" \" You did n't check the right boxes . \" \" Show me where the Florida oranges are then old man . \" He took me to the orange juice . Nearly every single orange juice across the board was Florida orange juice . Frustrated i even checked the frozen section of the store . Every last one there . \" Why is it only florida oranges that make juice ? Surely Florida oranges are good enough to sell too . I 've eaten oranges fresh off the tree from there . \" \" You 're right . You can only eat them there tho . \" Perplexed ? I was too . \" You remember having to check the sources of all the oranges right ? \" \" Yea . I had to make the tags for the shelves for it too . \" \" You 're not allowed to sell fresh Florida oranges outside of Florida . They carry plant infections that right now are only found in Florida . To prevent them from spreading , they have to either be processed into juice or sold within the state . \" Since Florida produces a large market share of oranges , and nearly all of the orange juice , prices are very low in comparison to oranges from other places . They are shoehorned into a tiny market with extreme supply . The only way to get rid of all their juice is to sell it cheap . It just so happens to be a bit cheaper than fresh oranges . At least in the US . Since you used liters as a unit of measurement you might be from someplace which does n't produce locally . In that case , the added cost of fresh oranges is from logistics . It is more costly to move fresh fruit than it is to move comparable amounts of \" liquid fruit . \" Transportation is made even cheaper by concentrating it initially , then adding water later .", "Well the cost of the orange you buy at the store is n't the cost of an orange a buyer who makes juice with it pays . The orange you buy has a lot of costs attached to it . Transportation , keeping in good condition , and also the potential loss to the store if it goes bad before it sells . The juice maker , however , buys it all in huge bulk and does n't need the treatment an orange at the store would need . Lots of costs saved there .", "I 've worked in an apple processing plant in a previous life . The first stop is a rough sorting of apples that can be used and sold in stores , and the other nasty bruised deformed ones . Those get trucked down the road to the juicing plant . In general , the produce that gets made into juice is n't the same quality that you see in the stores , so it gets sold to the juicers for a much lower price ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 288.33333333333337}

But that's not okay! *shaking head* It's important to treat others kindly and with respect, and to never hurt anyone unless they're hurting us first. *firm nod*\n\nIt's also important to remember that there are good people in the world, like their families and friends, who are very sad and worried when things like this happen. *compassionate smile* And there are also good people who are working to make sure that things like this don't happen again in the future. *nodding*\n\nSo, even though it's difficult to understand why bad things happen, it's important to remember that there are good things

the students , who were activists , were traveling to protest at a meeting where the mayor 's wife was to give a speech . So , he had his cops stop their bus and arrest them . They were then turned over to the local Drug Lord for disposition . The rest , as they say , is history .", "There 've been a lot of answers regarding what happened to the students and why . And most of them are correct , but I thought I 'd share a little more context regarding the background of the students . They were studying to become teachers in what is known in Mexico as a * Escuela Normal*(a school for future teachers ) hence the name that has been given to them * normalistas * roughly translated into aspiring teachers . This next paragraphs may piss someone off if taken out of context . Anyways these guys studied in a Rural * Normal * which in Mexico , specially southern Mexico , they are a \" breeding \" place for extreme left - wing activists , some of them peaceful , some of them violent . Evidence : [ photo 1 ] ( URL_0 ) [ photo 2 ] ( URL_1 ) This specific * Normal * in Ayotzinapa was n't the exception , with murals of Lenin , Che , Marx , Engels and Mexican guerrilla figures of the 70s . As the majority of extreme left wing activists in Mexico they are very rowdy , and sometimes become violent . Which pisses of the authorities , especially extreme authoritarian ones like in this town , so they pissed off the mayor 's wife . and the rest has been explained to you already . So basing myself on previous clashes between Mexican police and rowdy activists , when the students are detained , the police gets all \" Oh so who 's the bitch now ? \" , \" You 're not so tough now are you ? \" \" You 'll get what you deserve \" Again , like a truly authoritarian regime . What happened in Ayotzinapa was a pretty fucked up event , that borders on genocide . But want to know one of the reasons they were protesting ? For decades , in Mexico teacher jobs or * plazas * have been able to be inherited , as in \" my mom was a teacher , I 'll be a teacher if I want to even if I 'm the dumbest person on the planet who does n't know what 2 + 2 is . And there is nothing you can do about it . \" \" I just graduated as a teacher , now give me a fucking job ! ! I do n't care that the whole teaching system is oversaturated , I want my fucking job or I 'll start breaking shit \" \" Hell no you 're not going to test if I am a capable teacher or not ! \" ( a few years back all teachers in Mexico were forced to take a test . Those that passed the test was less than half , even though the minimum passing grade was ... THREE out of fucking TEN ! ! 30 % ! ! ! ) Recent educational bills tried to change this but there were massive protests started by teachers unions from the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero ( the state where the massacre took place ) Coincidently ( and not surprising ) , those two states always get the lowest scores in standardized student tests . EDIT : tl;dr . The reason the students were going to protest a speech by the mayor 's wife is a pretty fucking dumb and mediocre one . They wanted to keep ridiculous privileges that have been given to teachers even if they do n't deserve it . And no , however stupid their reasons were , does not justify the atrocity that the authorities made . EDIT : spelling", "Was it confirmed that they are dead ? Last I heard they were missing ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 282.33333333333337}

If you have Netflix you should watch some old movies . I 'd suggest Beach Blanket Bingo , any of the Dean Martin , Bing Crosby or Elvis Presley movies . ( Not because they are particularly outstanding , but because they give you an introduction to some history of the movie industry . That being said , there are a lot of old movies that I love ... ) The genre has some expectations . I seem to recall at least one movie without music in it , and I do n't remember enjoying it much .", "Indian music has a built in pecking - order , not only based on the seniority or ability of musicians but also by drawing a clear distinction between vocal and instrumental music . Vocal music is considered the highest form of music in India because the voice is God - given whereas instruments are man - made , albeit with the explicitly stated aim of trying to sound as close to the human voice as possible . As Indian music has its roots in devotional rituals , and melody is thought to have grown out of specific religious chanting whereby individual syllables and words of sacred verses had to be recited in a strictly prescribed pitch or tone , the human voice was always revered as something that contained immense mystical properties given the ability to evoke a sense of awe in listeners and performers alike . More crucially , although music by itself is said to carry the power to transform human hearts and help listeners connect to larger reality , vocal music has the added advantage of being able to verbalise a given emotion whether as direct praise of God or other deities or saints or as an expression of a specific human sentiment or emotion . Many good vocal compositions carefully match the given poetic sentiment to the actual emotional aspect of the raag in which that poetry is composed . Some compositions have such strong lyrical connotations that even when they ’re played as purely instrumental versions , the original lyrics , although un - sung , appear to be at the forefront of the performance . It ’s worth noting that while vocals are considered superior to all other instruments , ( for the reasons given above ) , there is no particular hierarchy within the array of instruments and all whether string , ( vina , sarod , sitar ) wind ( flute , shehnai , etc . ) or struck - string ( santoor ) , are considered equal with the further distinction that instruments which can produce melody are , on the whole , considered superior to percussion instruments . Percussion solos are a very recent phenomenon in Indian music and percussion ’s traditional role has always been to play “ second fiddle ” to a vocalist or instrumental soloist . But where newcomers to Indian music are concerned , the exact reverse order seems to apply in terms of relating to a new and strange musical tradition . They are , generally , first attracted by rhythm ( always easier to understand ) , secondly by melody in its instrumental variety and only very gradually do they admit to being drawn into vocal music – language always proving something of a barrier . Even so , one of the most phenomenally successful vocalists of our time , the late Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan , ( performer of qawwali – the music of South Asian Sufis or Islamic mystics which is heavily text - led ) sang with such a dynamic and charismatic confidence that a very large number of those who packed the concert halls for his performances around the world were unperturbed by not knowing the language(s ) of his songs – a clear case of music being able to transcend language", "Indian here . Bollywood movie basically have songs in them because the movie makers want the people to come watch the movie . Some people only go for the songs in the movie rather than the story ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 288.0}

of \" free trade \" really mean ? [ LY5 ] imagine that you want to play with your neighbor but every time that you want to play with him you must ask your parents for permission now , there is one more problem : your neighbor lives far away from you , and each time you want to play at his house you must cross a bridge and pay your neighbor for using that bridge the same applies to your neighbor but vice versa : every time that he wants to play in YOUR house he must pay YOU for using the bridge to come to your house , and ask his parents for permission one day your parents and your neighbor 's parents agree that you and your neighbor can come to play to each other house 's whenever you guys want to without asking your parents for permission and without paying for using the bridge that agreement is called free trade your parents are the USA and your neighbor 's parents are Mexico . you are Microsoft and your neighbor is Telmex ( a Mexican company ) . Microsoft can do business with Telmex without complicated burdens and vice - versa > What is North American Free Trade Agreement , who exactly agreed upon it ? it is a trade agreement signed by Canada , the USA , and Mexico > why is it controversial ? [ LY5 ] let 's go back to playing with your neighbor . after going to play at his house for a while you notice that his house is unhealthy and that your neighbor is not well fed . your neighbor 's parents can afford to buy more toys for your neighbor because they are not required to invest in their house nor in the nutrition of your neighbor suddenly , you never want to play at your own house , simply because your neighbor has more toys you ask your parents to buy you as many more toys as your neighbor but your parents ca n't because the laws in the USA require that your parents invest in a healthy house and in a healthy nutrition for yourself your parents ca n't afford to buy more toys because of the regulations that force them to maintain a high quality of life these regulations are mostly environmental , commercial , and work - related regulations ( such as wages ) which were not contained in the agreement for example , canada might have a regulation that forbids it to use coal in factories because coal is harmful for the environment . but Mexico might not have that same regulation . the thing is that manufacturing in Mexico by using coal might be cheaper than manufacturing in Canada without coal . this causes that all manufacturing migrates to Mexico . the issue was that the use of coal was not ratified in the original agreement . Canada ratified that regulation , on its own nation and by its own , after the agreement was signed ( once again , coal is a fictitious example )", "\" Free trade \" means people can trade without the government getting involved . For instance , Coca Cola needs sugar and the cheapest place to get that is some company in Mexico ( hypothetical , probably not true ) . They can go do that , without having to worry about import / export shenanigans . NAFTA is just a free trade agreement between the US , Canada and Mexico . Our companies can do things with each other and it 's not considered import / export . Some view it controversially because it cuts a source of government funding ( tariffs ) and removes a barrier from keeping industry within the country . If a company had to pay a tariff on a good when importing it , there may be a domestic good that would end up being cheaper .", "Literally it means being able to trade between countries without any government interference from either country .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow come a feather and a coin / bowling ball fall at exactly the same speed in a vacuum ? Curious after reading this article URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* That's a really cool question you've got there. So, you know how things fall down when you drop them, right? Like when you drop a ball or a feather. Well, in space, where there's no air, things fall at the same speed! *excited nod*\n\nThat's because objects don't have any air resistance in space. Air resistance is like a special kind of friction that happens when things move through the air. It's what makes things slow down when you drop them. But in space, there's no air, so things don't have to worry about air resistance. They just keep on falling at the same speed! *excited nod*\n\nIt's kind of like when you're rolling down a hill on a toboggan. At first, you go really fast, but then you start to slow down because of the friction from the ground. But if you were rolling down a hill in space, you wouldn't slow down at all! You'd just keep on rolling, really fast, until you reached the ground. *excited nod*\n\nSo, a feather and a coin will fall at the same speed in space because they don't have to worry about air resistance slowing them down.

And you know what makes it easier to find stuff on shelves? *scratches chin* Yes, you guessed it! High ceilings! *excited clap*\n\nSo, why do grocery stores need high ceilings? *leaning in* Well, imagine you're a giant, and you're reaching up to grab a box of cookies from a really high shelf. *giggles* If the ceiling is too low, you might hit your head on it! Ow! *pretends to hit head* And nobody wants that, right? *nods*\n\nHigh ceilings help prevent that, plus they make it easier for people to walk around and look at all the yummy food and stuff.

( Except for those annoying freeze - or - fry areas where air flows are concentrated . ) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building , either by exhaust or pressurizing the building ( negative and positive pressure ventilation , respectively ) . Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer ( higher ) columns required , which in turn need to be stronger because of ( typically ) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses . Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required . When designers are tasked to create ' open space ' , regardless of low or high ceilings , larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased , thus ' opening ' the space . However , this is not always the case , such as in multi - story structures where significant weight / loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing ( e.g. , airports , parking ramps , hotels ) . Operating costs do tend to be higher , but it is a trade off on the desired space / affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense . Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects , so the owner / operator knows early - on what to expect . These factors also contribute to changes in a design if costs are deemed to be unreasonable or exceeding targets / goals . Source : Engineer by day , Firefighter by night . Edit : Additional information regarding costs .", "Hi ! I 'm no architect , but luckily , I do know a few ! I work in the construction business with my dad and every now and again bump into an architect . Sorry for the long amount of text incoming by the way ... So on a lunch run at our local Safeway with said architect and my father , I indeed asked him why the ceiling height was so high , and why it would n't be cost effective to heat and cool the mass of air . His answer , paraphrased : The store ceilings are high because it helps regulate interior temperature ( news to me ) and cuts down severely on the sheer acoustic noise created by the public and the checkout lines and the such . Apparently , it 's cost effective to use minimal heat , along with the hot lights in the ceiling ( news to me that supermarket light 's heat was ACTUALLY put to use ) and to circulate that using ventilation installed on the roof of the structure . Also , the height is useful for displays and the such , which I already knew . Proof : Yeah , sorry . No pics or anything . Just Google it if you do n't believe me ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 289.0}

Each playgroup has different requirements to get in . Each playgroup has their own part of the playset , and they still play with other kids outside of the playset and other playgroups , but at the end of the day , they always go back to their playgroups . Now imagine each playgroup has a babysitter , and that babysitter oversees several playgroups at other playsets and she reports to a mom . The babysitter is like a regional coordinator or a house mom or what have you . The Mom is like the national / international president . Each playset is like greek life on another campus . Each playgroup is like a house . I think this metaphor shows how transitive houses can be from generation to generation and school to school . Originally I did n't want to join a sorority . I thought it was really stupid . My aunt paid for my rush fee so I did it . Just rush / recruitment itself really brought me out of my shell . It really made me grow up and I learned a lot about discretion and friendship . A girl on my lacrosse team always bashes sororities , but she 's closest with all the girls in Greek life on our team . It 's amazing if you find the right house with the right girls . Every house at every campus during different generations are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT . So if your best friend joins Phi Upsilon Kappa ( made up , does n't exist as far as I know ) at All - American University , does n't mean you have to join Phi Upsilon Kappa at your university . In Greek life , you get to meet a lot of people ( especially if you go to a big school like me ) and it makes a big campus feel smaller because you meet people from mixers / raids / invites whatever you want to call them . I 've gotten so many connections for professors , classes , and any help I 've needed . A lot of my best friends are in Greek life , but I also have friends who refuse to be in Greek life and friends who dropped out of Greek life . It 's not like some elite club where you ignore everyone else . One way we describe it is \" there 's a friend , and then there 's a sister \" If you feel nervous or unsure , go through rush anyways , and do n't accept a bid unless you are absolutely sure . There is always next semester / quarter . If you 're an incoming freshman , talk to people you know at the school already and what their opinion is on it . Sometimes Greek life at some schools is horrible , sometimes it 's the best thing in the world . You just have to see if it 's right for you . TL;DR : go through recruitment .

But then, scientists like Dalton and Thomson came along and discovered something amazing! *excited tone*\n\nThey made tiny little models of atoms using special tools and instruments, and they saw that the atoms looked like tiny balls with a tiny center bit called a nucleus. The nucleus is where all the positive charge of the atom is kept, and the balls are the parts that are negative. It's kind of like a tiny solar system with a sun (nucleus) and planets (electrons) orbiting around it! *nodding*\n\nBut how did they make these little models? *intrigued* Well, they used special tools like microscopes to see really, really small things. They also did things like crashing atoms together and watching how they broke apart to figure out what they looked like. It was a lot like playing with toys, but instead of Legos, they were using atoms! *grin*\n\nNow, we have even better ways to see how atoms look", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0},

Imagine someone gives you a gift . It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box . You have no idea what the gift is , but decide to do some experiments to find out , without actually opening the box . First you shake the box and it moves around . This tells you it is relatively light . Then , knowing that it is light , you move it slowly and you feel it rolling . This tells you that it is probably round . Now you are trying to find out what it is made of . You apply heat to the box , then shake to see if it has melted but it has not . You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere . Still , you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not . But from the tests you carried out , you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact . That 's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model . As for being able to see it , I do n't think so . We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope . LM uses lightwaves ( duh ) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves can not be seen . EM uses electrons ( of course ) , which which are very tiny , and they bounce back of the object at different angles to give us awesome 3d images . I do n't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom ... but that 's beside the point . The Rutherford experiments already did that , and it told us that materials are mostly empty space and there is much distance between the nucleus and an electron . So , you ca n't see the \" model \" of the atom , but you can see individual atoms using an TEM transmission electron microscope iirc .", "We ca n't directly see an atom and in fact , depending on what you 're trying to do with an atom or what situation you 're looking at it , you could \" pretend \" an atom looks different .

When working with inorganic chemistry , we assume the most traditional model of the atom that you see with a nucleus and electrons . Basically , we can understand what an atom looks like as a result of it reacting with the universe in specific ways . It would be like if you had an animal that you could never look at directly , so you decide to use your other senses and how that animal behaves to determine what animal it is .", "There were several experiments that were conducted that gave us a very clear idea of what an atom would have to look like in order for the data to make sense .

JFK wanted to go to the moon . 2 . Seeing stuff in space is as easy as looking up . Comparatively speaking , there is TONS of money available for space exploration and space technology development . We as a society heavily benefit from nearly every satellite we put up there , so it behooves us to understand space as much as we can . Additionally , it is easy to do most space research ... all you need is a telescope , some computers , and a cloudless night . On the other hand , the ocean is dark , wet , cold , corrosive , and dangerous . The only way to really study it is to get inside it , which is fantastically difficult for us as humans to do . We already know the bottom of the ocean looks a lot like dry land with mountains and canyons , so the only real unknown is sea life , and no one is going to pour billions of dollars into undersea expeditions \" just because \" . We have ( unfortunately ) put a very low value on the potential discoveries the ocean has to offer . For people who actually want to perform underwater research , there is also the rather debilitating reality that vast majority of the ocean is just empty , cold water .", "I ca n't say for sure but I think it 's because it 's \" easier \" to look up at the sky with a telescope than to get to the bottom of the ocean . Also everyone sees the sky and the stars while not everyone is around an ocean , so some people who may have been interested in deep sea exploration are n't because they do n't get to see the magnificence of even the top layers of the ocean and wonder what 's underneath . Another explanation could be that the Cold War had a space race , not a deep sea race , which led to a huge increase in technology and also sparked interest", "There are several factors I can think of . Some more prohibiting than others . 1 . Its dangerous . Its just as dangerous as going to space . The incredibly high pressures , volcanoes , mountain ranges , and unknown creatures makes it the most hostile environment on Earth . 2 . Its dark . Think if space was like the ocean , and you could only see a few feet in front of you . We would have virtually no information on our own solar system let alone the stars . 3 . It requires a lot of energy . Unlike a space probe which will continue to move and explore long after its fuel runs out , a deep sea submersible will not . It requires a constant source of propulsion , which means constantly returning to the surface to refuel or recharge . 4 . Its time consuming . We acquire information from space literally at the speed of light . As for the oceans , the exploration happens at the speed of the deep sea vehicle . These vehicles are n't designed to move very fast . Even if their speed was increased , it would n't matter . Its like trying to explore all of Siberia at night with a flashlight and a disposable camera while driving a golf cart . It would take many years , possibly many decades to explore the entire ocean . 5 . Its expensive . Space is much more expensive over a single mission . But compare to the amount of money it would take to launch hundreds of expeditions over many decades , it 's not . With space exploration you get more bang for your buck . A single voyage to the ocean floor yields very little information compared to a single space mission . Its not impossible , but its definitely a challenge for the future . It really is the final frontier for Earthly exploration ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 286.0}

big, grown-up toy rockets! *gasp* And when they start up, they make this big noise called a \"cone.\" *watching*\n\nA cone is like a big, round thingy that shoots out of the engine when it starts working. *excited gesture* It's like a special kind of spout that helps the engine blast off into space! *oooh* And the reason it forms in the shape of a cone is because that's the best way for the engine to shoot out a lot of hot gas really quickly! *nodding*\n\nCan you imagine being able to shoot off into space like a rocket?! *mind-blown* It's like a magical adventure! *starry eyes* And that's why space shuttles have these awesome engines that make the cone! *excitedly*\n\nI hope that answers your question, my young friend! *smiling* Do you have any more questions about space

Supersonic(faster than the speed of sound ) exhaust causes them to form . They can also be seen on supersonic jet engine exhaust plumes .", "These are [ shock diamonds ] ( URL_0 ) . Rocket engines are designed to operate in space , where there is no atmosphere , and so the pressure of the gases leaving the engine is lower than the surrounding air . The atmospheric pressure compresses the gases leaving the nozzle ; as this flow is supersonic it creates shock waves , which are made visible by ignition of unburnt fuel . [ This website ] ( URL_1 ) has a more complete explanation .", "The SSME 's nozzle runs [ over - expanded ] ( URL_4 ) at sea level , because it 's designed for maximum performance at high altitudes . This means that its exhaust pressure is less than ambient , and so there is an exchange of energy between pressure energy and kinetic energy at and downstream of the nozzle exit plane as the flow tries to sort itself out and achieve equilibrium . Because the flow is supersonic , this exchange takes place via [ shock waves ] ( URL_2 ) . This shock waves produce dramatic local variations in the density of the flow . As the exhaust flow goes through these shock waves , it slows down . This converts some of its kinetic energy into increased pressure energy , which helps it to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere . However , because of the gas law ( PV = ρRT ) , the rapid increase in pressure drives up the static temperature of the gas ( total temperature is approximately conserved ) . This means that the flow immediately downstream of the shock is both denser and hotter than the flow immediately upstream of the shock . This has a dramatic impact upon how bright it appears to be , because 1 . The amount of light emitted within a given volume of gas obviously depends upon the number of atoms or molecules within that volume , and is therefore proportional to density . 2 . The total radiative power is proportional to the [ fourth power ] ( URL_0 ) of the static temperature of the gas . 3 . The SSME 's exhaust is a mixture of steam and Hydrogen , which mostly emits [ spectral lines ] ( URL_3 ) rather than black body radiation . This means that there is a minimum activation energy to get anything to happen , and so a relatively small increase in the mean static specific energy of the flow may result in a sudden and dramatic increase in radiation . Because LH2 / LOX engines produce an exhaust which contains no carbon , the flame has a very low emissivity , and is mostly transparent ( most of the radiation is actually in the UV range ; the red / pink tint comes from excess hydrogen in the exhaust , which is there because Isp is maximized by running rich and thereby lowering the mean molecular mass of the flow ) . This means that the Mach disc shows up particularly well . You can get a better idea of just how over - expanded the flow is from [ this image of a test firing . ] ( URL_1 ) Incidentally , if you were wondering why the Delta IV has a much brighter exhaust despite also burning LH2 / LOX , the reason is that the [ RS-68 ] ( URL_5 ) uses an ablative nozzle to cut cost . As it ablates , it adds carbon to the exhaust , upping its emissivity , producing a brighter , more yellow , flame . * * tl;dr * * over - expansion of the exhaust produces shock waves , which dramatically change the local static specific enthalpy in some parts of the flow . The amount of light emitted per unit volume is a very strong function of the local static specific enthalpy . * edited to fix a typo *"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 259.0}

currency against the euro . Back then it almost hit a point of parity ( close to even value for currency ) and the Swiss export industries ( mainly tourism ) were greatly suffering . Now the cap which was set at 1.20 to the euro has been removed and the currency appreciated to it 's natural value which as of right now is exactly in parity to the euro . The situation is crazy , the currency appreciated by a ridiculous amount in almost 15 minutes . The snb did this in order to fight the quantitative easing the European Central Bank is going to be implementing soon to help the struggling euro zone nations such as Italy , Portugal , Ireland , Spain , Greece which all combined have a many trillions in state debt and are all fighting huge levels of unemployment . So to sum up the currency cap was removed , the currency sky rocketed to it 's natural value and the Swiss export industries are suffering greatly . Source - my roommate who is a very active forex trader Hope I did n't fuck up as I 'm on mobile", "While of course it 's more complicated than this . Essentially , the Swiss economy has been doing a lot better than the Eurozone economy , which meant the Swiss franc was rising relative to the euro over time . This is bad , in some ways , for Switzerland because it means Eurozone nations must pay more to import Swiss products . Swiss companies want a \" weaker \" franc , so the rest of Europe will buy their products from them rather than someplace cheaper . So , the Swiss National Bank decided to enforce an artificial cap on the exchange rate at 1.2 francs per euro . With this cap in place , 1.2 to 1 was the lowest it could get , but it could always go higher . Thus , traders and investors bet on the euro to rise against the franc , feeling safe due to the cap . In addition , since currency usually only moves a % in the short term , investors can borrow a lot more money to trade . However , the Swiss National Bank abruptly removed that cap , which caused the franc to immediately rise 30 % and since the change was so rapid , most could not sell their investments fast enough . Now those who borrowed money are in a lot of debt or insolvent , which included the largest foreign - exchange broker in the US and Asia , FXCM , Inc.", "Both the Swiss decoupling and the US stock decline are likely a response to the upcoming ECB QE , which is probably going to be of a truly massive scale . My best guess is Draghi let the Swiss and a few favored private banks ( like Draghi 's BFFs at Goldman ) know that not only was QE coming , but that it will be larger than expected . The SNB was forced to surrender the peg , as holding it would have exposed the balance sheet to insolvency . They also had to do it secretly and suddenly ( since any announcement of a future plan to abandon a peg exposes a central bank to massive losses ) . The kicker is the SNB may still try to knock down the franc by buying non - Euro currencies ( primarily the USD ) . It will also likely try to reduce its accumulated stock of toxic Euros by selling at strategic times , which will encourage macro funds to bet against the Euro . If I were gambling , I 'd predict USDEUR parity sometime in early 2016 , since Yellen has thus far seemed disinclined to keep doing big QE ( which has likely created massive U.S. asset bubbles ) ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 259.0}

to promote Floyd until Floyd decided to buy himself out of his contract about eight years ago . It was a very very bad split with a lot of bad blood on both sides that still exists to this day . The fight almost happened in 2010 , there are even contracts that Pacquiao 's team had drawn up and sent to Mayweather floating around on the internet somewhere , but ultimately they could n't agree on the topic of drug testing , mostly on how many days out from the fight blood would be drawn , because Pacquiao felt in his loss to Erik Morales in 2005 that having blood drawn a couple days before the fight weakened him . More recently , the main reason for the fight not happening is Floyd wanting to keep his undefeated record , combined with the fact that he 's guaranteed ~30 million , plus PPV upside for every fight . So yes he can fight Manny and make 75 million , but in his mind why take on a fight he has probably a 45 % chance of losing , when he can take fights for 40 million or so against opponents he knows he has a 90 % chance of beating , like a Marcos Maidana . Floyd is already going to make so much $ that he does n't want to risk losing to a guy as skilled and powerful as Pacquiao . If I had to say , I 'd say most of the blame falls on Floyd for the fight not happening . Yes , Manny 's side is at fault too , but I think history will look back and say it was mostly Floyd 's fault . Hopefully , now that Floyd is in the final year of his CBS / Showtime contract , he 'll step up and fight Manny because his contract and the guaranteed $ is up soon anyway , and he might as well try and cash in before he gets too old . There 's also a not that well known story about when Michael Koncz , one of Pacquiao 's advisers , flew to the Mayweather house in Vegas . During this time , Manny and Floyd actually spoke to each other on the phone , trying to come to some sort of agreement . Koncz said that Floyd , after speaking to Manny , said , what happens if i lose ? Koncz told him , we 'll have a rematch and you 'll make even more $ , which is true , what boxing / casual fan would nt want to see a rematch assuming it was an entertaining fight ? Floyd knows he can lose , and honestly that 's part of what has made him such a great fighter , his matchmaking and opponent selection in relation to maximizing $ is about as good as its ever gotten since Joe Louis back in the 1930 's and 40 's . As a side note , it also interest me that Manny and Floyd have never met in person . it 'd be weird in any other sport for the two best athletes in that sport to have never met , but apparently they have n't . I 'm sure eventually they 'll bump into each other , and that should be pretty interesting , as Pacquiao is said to really hate Floyd .", "One of the main official excuse that always seems to pop up is the fact that Mayweather wants there to be strict blood testing at random fights during the training camps , Pacquiao 's camp have always refused this , one what grounds I do n't know if that s ever been communciated properly .", "yeah he is undefeated , and Floyd is n't going to fight someone who has PED 's roomers tied to his name , i mean it would be one heck of a fight but that one loss on his record is nt worth it ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 268.66666666666663}

But, just like how you need different fairy dust for different things, Wi-Fi signals work the same way! 😊\n\nYou see, each Wi-Fi network has its own special fairy dust, called a network name and password. These are like secret ingredients that make the Wi-Fi network magic work. When you want to connect to a Wi-Fi network, you have to use the right fairy dust – the network name and password – to make the magic happen. 🔮\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"What if I had two different fairy dust packets (or Wi-Fi network names and passwords)? Can't I just combine them to make one super-duper Wi-Fi network that's extra-extra fast?\" Unfortunately, nope! 🙅‍♀️\n\nThat's because each fairy dust packet (or Wi-Fi network name and password) has its own special powers.

The way the Internet works , it 's basically sending messages to addresses ( where each address corresponds to one Internet connection ) . The idea of a single device having multiple addresses was n't planned when the foundations for the Internet were designed in the 70s . The Internet Engineering Task Force published a Request for Comments on what they call [ multipath TCP ] ( URL_0 ) a couple years ago . It 's still considered experimental . Newer iPhones use it to allow more seamless switching between wi - fi and cellular data , but that 's the only use of it that I know of .", "It 's sort of possible , but you need specific hardware to achieve it . Your computer probably only has one wireless receiver built into it , which can only connect to one wireless network at any one time . Incidentally , if you 're not familiar with how networks work , here 's a super brief explanation . Networks operate by sending and receiving packets of information . Routers are in charge of taking those packets and forwarding them to the correct destination . When you watch a YouTube video you are receiving packets of information from a content provider 's servers . Data packets are sent from there through multiple routers ( including your home router ) , eventually hitting your computer . In order to link together multiple Internet connections you 'd need to set up something like ... Multi - WAN or multi - homing , which allows you to \" bond \" multiple lines into what is effectively one line with increased bandwidth . However , there are several caveats : * Without support from your ISP ( which would n't happen in your case since you have at the very least multiple accounts in use through one ISP and at worst multiple ISPs ) , you will not see tripled speeds on downloads , only what one connection supplies . However , you can run three downloads , and each will run at the maximum speed one WAN connection can handle at the same time . The router can route new requests over whichever of the two lines has the most available bandwidth if you set up the load - balancer correctly . * Most residential routers do not support multi - homing ( at least with stock firmware ) . If you have a router which supports DD - WRT , I believe it is possible , but still very tricky to configure correctly . I 'm not sure if a residential router can support it even with DD - WRT , given that they generally only have 1 WAN port and the rest are switched internally . * Sticky connections are necessary for much of today 's web , and might be difficult to set up depending on what software you 're running on your router . I honestly do n't know of a device that can do this with * * wireless * * WAN links , although it can be done via wired connections . What you wish to accomplish may also be achieved by setting up load balancing on a per packet basis , but you must have a server that handles incoming packets from all WAN links and reassembles the data into one unified stream . It 's fairly complicated and it definitely can not be done over wireless connections .", "It is , it 's just not easy . You can connect a computer to 2 difirent networks . The problem is , it then becomes very complicated to mantain 2 connections and 2 athuntetations and ensure that the packets from the 2 connections are assembeled in the correct order . Basiclly everything become an order of magnituade more complex . Because this is not a common thing there is really no consumer friendly software that does it so you need to be very techinicaly profissent to accomplish it ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 285.33333333333337}

There generally are n't police patrolling private stadiums and , where there are , their focus is more on the safety of the public / spectators , not the \" performers\"/athletes . So if a police officer were to see an athlete harm another athlete in a way that was * * completely , and explicitly illegal * * , they could and should arrest that individual . The issue is that contact - sports are a consenting arrangement between parties . How absurd would it be for an officer to have arrested Mike Tyson after one of his monster , brutal knock - outs ? Then again , why was n't Mike Tyson arrested after biting off a guy 's ear ? The answer , as pointed out in another comment , is that sports largely police themselves . All participants agree to a certain range of physical contact / harm . This \" consent \" makes much of the contact that occurs not really a \" crime \" and , rather , becomes purely a civil issue . This means that players who believe that another player exceeded the appropriate level of harm they consented to can bring them to court . There was a famous case years ago out of the NFL where a player was hit after the play had ended and was paralyzed . The judges had a lot to deal with . One of my favorite comments was something like , \" In a boxing match , boxers do not get to choose which blows they consent to receiving -- rather , they consent to the entirety of engagement . \" Facts that play into whether something crosses a line are ( a ) how often does it happen in the sport ( are the players aware of the risk ) , ( b ) did the act violate the official , enforced rules of the sport , ( c ) what are the penalties conveyed by the sports organization , etc . * * tl;dr :* * \" Arrested \" is something that happens to people who act in a way that justifies temporarily denying them freedom while the court can figure out if a law has been violated ... in many sports , everyone is a willing , consenting participant which makes it more of a civil issue than a legal one . * * Edit :* * Just to add something I mentioned in a different comment below -- another reason that intentional acts of violence are not criminal in a sport even if they are so seemingly outside the scope of being appropriate is that those acts are usually already handled by some sort of foul / penalty within the game . Hockey , for example , penalizes intentional , violent violations of its rules with varying penalty - box repercussions , suspensions , etc . The fact that specific penalties exist for intentional violent acts is an example of how it * * is * * a part of the game , and it is a part that has been consented to by all parties . Only when it exceeds an extreme , relative level will it become a criminal issue .", "Courts have a long standing precedent to let leagues & sports organizations police themselves and for good reason . Sports are physical activities , which means people can hurt each other during the game by playing dirty . Sometimes , the only way to keep the other team from continuing to play dirty is to either openly confront or fight them or play dirty in return . You see a hockey player get hit in the nuts by a stick ... what you did n't see was the entire opposing team , for the last 40 minutes , whacking guys on the back of the calves whenever they skate past just because they can .", "I believe they can , but only if the player requests to pursue charges ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 271.33333333333337}

It's like a special kind of talking that only happens inside their minds! *giggles*\n\nYou see, they're not really speaking any language at all. They're actually talking to God in their own special way! *excitedly* It's like they're having a conversation with God, but instead of using words, they're using special sounds that only they can hear. It's kind of like singing, but instead of singing a song, they're singing words to God! *makes happy sounds*\n\nIt's a really cool thing that happens inside their minds, and it's like a special way for them to talk to God without using any actual words. It's like they're speaking straight from their hearts! *nodding* And it's a really important part of some Christians' faith.

I can only imagine how many people act on a weekly basis", "When I was 16 I went to one of those Evangelical / Pentecostal churches with my GF 's family . People would speak in tongues and 1 or 2 people would translate whatever was said . If it was 2 people translating it would always be one ' getting ' exactly half of what was said . ( Always thought that was odd ) . The person speaking in tongues was supposedly speaking in some random ancient language but the speech would just be gibberish with no discernable form or structure . To me it sounded like the same syllable or 2 repeated over and over . ( Think ' tralalalalalala falalalalala relalalalala ' and repeat a couple of times ) Sometimes someone would ' fall down and have convulsions ' . They also did faith healing and the preacher supposedly had the ' power ' to knock people down . Those who ' went down ' would be out for a little while and claim to have had some spiritual experience while they were out . I found all of this fucking hilarious and to keep from laughing my ass off I 'd bite my tongue and lip , stand on my own foot , etc . I only went because I was fucking their daughter and got to spend more time with her that way . Her dad had one of those land yacht luxury cars , this was 1980 , that he only drove to church on Sunday and Wednesday . My parents would drop me off at the GF 's house Sunday afternoon and her parents would give me a ride home after church . ( I lived about a half hour outside of town ) Their daughter and I would sit in the back seat with a blanket pulled over us , this was winter , and I 'd finger her twat while she gave me a handy . My mom never did ask why I 'd always run to my room and change my underwear after they dropped me off .", "Why are you quiet in a library ? You act how you are expected to act in some places . Speaking in tongues is an example of this . If you go to a charismatic / pentecostal church where people tell you that to be a true believer you must do x , you are more inclined to do x. It is through the people 's desire to conform this happens . Speaking in tongues was one of the spiritual gifts mentioned in the Bible , but some sects within Christianity believe it is necessary to speak in tongues to show you are a true believer . How it differs from what was said in the Bible is very simple to point out : 1 Co 14:27 > If any speak in a tongue , let there be only two or at most three , and each in turn , and let someone interpret . But if there is no one to interpret , let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God . The tongues mentioned there requires only 2 or 3 people and someone to interpret . I believe some of these charismatic churches actually attempt to follow this , but many just have people speaking loudly and publicly in a language that nobody could interpret when they were told to be silent . tl;dr - I think it just through the need to conform that these people ' speak in tongues ' because the church they attend makes them feel they must as evidence they are true believers . It reminds me of the [ elevator experiment ] ( URL_0 ) ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 275.33333333333337}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow do video game companies develop for every platform at once ?

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Developing games for multiple platforms at once can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I'm here to explain it in a way that's easy to understand! 😊\n\nYou know how there are different kinds of toys, like blocks, cars, and dolls? Each toy is designed for a specific age group and has different rules for play. Likewise, different video game consoles, like Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, have their own rules for how games can be played. These rules are like special parameters that the developers use as guidelines when they make the game. 🤖\n\nThink of these parameters like a recipe for your favorite food. The recipe tells you how much of each ingredient to use and in what order, but you might need different ingredients for a different type of food. Similarly, different consoles have different \"ingredients\" that the developers use to make the game work on each one. 🍔🍟🌮\n\nNow, imagine you have a toy box full of different toys, and you want to play with all of them at the same time. It can be a bit tricky, but you can still play with all of them if you have a special toy that lets you do that!

the lower end of the industry ) we basically had a layer of API code that sits between the game engine and the platform , and that API layer translated all of the inputs from a particular platform ( from the controller , keyboard , mouse , etc ) into platform - independent input data that the engine could process without knowing the platform . Then the engine would spit out generic outputs , which the API layer would transform into platform - specific graphics and whatnot . Our art teams , meanwhile , would typically have to export all of their materials in a different format for each platform , to best leverage that platform 's graphics system . The advantage of this approach is that you spend less time customizing the game for each platform . The chief disadvantage is that it 's harder to really push the boundaries of what each system can do , and you end up with games that are a bit less ambitious , have less jaw - dropping visuals , and run a bit slower . Higher end studios , like EA Sports , probably put a LOT more money into customizing games for each platform . This is also really only true of the large - format platforms : Xbox , PC , etc . Handhelds , especially with all the phones and tablets on the market now , have such wildly different technical capabilities that developers at all levels have to do a lot more customizing for each platform .", "To understand how it 's done it 's important to understand that there are various situations in where platform differences manifest . The areas where those differences exist , is where we focus our efforts on abstraction , such that for a particular component that is different ; we have a particular solution . In the grand scheme of the final video game , we hand pick the right components and you 're left with a final video game that targets some platform . Need another platform ? Just work on a solution for one of these components . There are however situations in which these components can not be . To conceptualize such a component ( API ) , you have to make a contract in which that component communicates or functions ( ABI ) . If the differences between components are too vast , then the contract would need to change to satisfy all components . This is why sometimes to support another target you must first break an existing one . What you 'll often find is that as you support more targets your contract tends to get more vague . This is a major pain in the ass . Another more obvious example is performance . Video game consoles , computers , hand - held devices , etc all tend to vary quite drastically in how they function internally . These internal differences are sometimes exploited by very clever programmers to achieve high performance characteristics . This exploitation is not easily transferable to other targets however , in fact sometimes it is n't transferable at all .", "To go deeper than the \" game engine does it for you \" level of other answers : Say you want to put the letter A on the screen . We will say the game engine call looks like this : put_letter_on_screen(\"A \" ) The game engine implements it like this : if $ platform is xbox360 then do print_letter(\"A \" ) if $ platform is ps3 then do draw_character(\"A \" ) $ platform is a placeholder for an actual value . What the game developers then do is change the placeholder like this $ platform = xbox360 and build the code This all happens automatically and is supported by the game engine itself so all they have to do is click a button and it builds everything ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 272.66666666666663}

when something goes wrong and the machine accidentally writes the wrong data , or overwrites the wrong part of the data , or deletes something that should n't have been deleted . This could be as simple as putting a 1 where a 0 should be , or it could be much more complex . Sometimes the machine can figure out what went wrong with the data and can correct it , but if it ca n't , the file can be unrecoverable .", "Data corruption is pretty simple , actually . Memory ( whether it 's read - only like a CD ROM or read / write like RAM ) is a device which stores a big long list of 0 's and 1 's . Those 0 's and 1 's are divided in to megabytes , kilobytes , and bytes ( and words , pages , sectors , and all kinds of other units ) . When your data becomes corrupted , it means that there 's a 0 where there SHOULD be a 1 . Most devices are smart enough to see this and fix the error ( it 's called \" parity checking \" - google that for a more detailed explanation of * how * a memory error is recovered ) . If there are enough misplaced 0 's and 1 's it becomes very difficult for the device to figure out what things should be - rather than trying to repair it , it bails out and says \" memory error ! \" Some read / write devices ( like RAM , hard drives , and USB memory ) may run into situations where it 's unable to properly read or write from a particular area of memory . This can be caused by a lot of things ( read / write arm does n't want to work there , it 's been destroyed by magnetism , etc ) . If this is the case , the device will usually black - list that part of memory and refuse to use it . After enough of the device gets black - listed , you end up with complete failure and have to buy a new device .", "When you save your game to the PS2 's memory card , a file is written to some flash memory - just like saving a text document to a USB flash drive . The data in the file is structured - it has specific fields in it that indicate different parts of the saved state of the game . For instance , there might be a section of the file that indicates the maximum health of your character , or whether or not you 've completed a specific quest . When the game goes to load this file off your card , if the data is wrong somehow - the maximum health is off the charts , or your inventory is full of items that do n't exist - then the save file is considered corrupt and ca n't be loaded . Corruption can occur for many reasons . One is that memory is n't always foolproof . Hard drives fail , flash memory can go bad , etc . It was especially bad in the earlier days of flash memory , so GameCube , Playstation , PS2 , etc memory cards were more error prone than the USB keys we use today . The technology has improved somewhat to be more fault tolerant and to work for longer . It 's also possible that the game had a glitch or was turned off while saving , thus writing an invalid or incomplete file to the card . It 's also possible that external conditions could damage the device ( and thus , the file stored on it ) over time . Since there 's typically nothing players can do to recover a corrupted save , the game typically just gives you a generic error and refuses to load the game ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 283.0}

Fuel: Inside the reactor, there's a tiny bit of radioactive material like uranium (🛠️🏭) The uranium is turned into gas and pumped into tiny little rods. These rods are like fuel for a car, but instead of gasoline, they have atomic energy! 🚀\n2. Neutrones: When the uranium gas is pumped into the reactor, it starts to make little neutrones (🤖) These neutrones are like tiny atoms that bounce around really fast and give energy to the reactor.\n3. Reactor Core: The neutrones hit a special metal called control rods (🛤️🕰️) These rods are like the reactor's brakes. They slow down the neutrones so they don't make more energy, but instead keep the reactor stable. 🚨\n4.

spin and produce the power . \" Starting up \" a reactor means removing enough of the control rods ( radiation absorbers ) that the fuel gets hot and boils water to steam . Maintaining a stable reaction requires inserting or removing fuel or control rods so the temperature and reactions stay within defined ranges . For extra security , a huge pool of water is generally over the rods to absorb errant radiation and cool the rods should trouble arise . Storing the energy does not happen . It 's being created so it can be used nearly immediately . The energy that was stored came in the form of Uranium and other elements forged in the bellies of supernovae billions of years ago and trillions of miles away from us . Tl;dr : We boil water with chunks of solid stars .", "First , understand that nearly all electric generation is steam moving a turbine on a generator which creates electricity to transmission along lines or storage in ( capacitors and batteries ) so , nuclear power is used to create heat , to make steam to turn a turbine and make electricity . The Nuclear part is a set of radioactive and nonradioactive rods ( in 1970s technology ) which when set in an array get hot through the reaction , to heat water to make steam to turn a turbine . The rods are set up so as to be raised or lowered to intensify or reduce those reactions , along with insulating material to control the rate of those radioactive reactions and to control the heat created . ( that 's eli5 , with all sorts of near correct info ) .", "Many of these answers are not 100 % correct . The internal fuel portion of a nuclear reactor is uranium dioxide , enriched approximately 3 - 4 % , and contained in a fuel rod , which is a part of a fuel assembly containing typically 90 - 120 rods . A fuel cell contains 4 fuel assemblies , which are permanently in place unless a refuel cycle is occurring . The control rod , which contains neutron absorbing elements such as Boron or Hafnium , are moved in and out of the fuel cell to control the number of reactions occurring at any given time . Neutrons love Boron and Hafnium , even more than U-235 - which is why the control rods are made of such elements . It is the free neutrons that produce the nuclear reactions , not the protons . The two common reactor types are boiling water reactor and pressurized water reactor . At a PWR , the water does not boil . The water is kept at such a high pressure that boiling is prohibited and the heat generated by the fuel burn is transferred to a secondary volume thru a steam generator , which boils and turns your turbine . BWRs send water up thru the fuel assemblies , removing the heat generated , boiling and converting to steam by the exit of the top of the fuel assembly . The wet steam goes thru a moisture separator and dryer and off to spin the turbine and make electricity . Nuke plants are very stable once they 're operating . Typically a plant will stay online continuously for 18 - 24 months depending on type of fuel used . A plant maintains operations for so long without refuel by beginning the cycle with a good portion of the control rods only halfway out . Over a couple months , a few rods will be pulled out just a bit , uncovering more of the fuel . The huge pool of water over the fuel mentioned would by the spent fuel pool that is adjacent to the reactor . Any other questions , let me know .

And just like how you might see your favorite toy go up and down when you play, money can also go up and down in value. It's like a big game of \"economic Twister\"! *chuckles*\n\nNow, why do currencies move up and down? Well, it's kind of like a game of \"economic tag\"! *giggles* Economies all around the world are like different teams playing the game, and they can all change where they stand depending on things like how many toys they have (or how many goods and services they can make and sell). If one team has more toys than another, their team will go up, and vice versa! *nodding*\n\nBut, sometimes the teams can get really good at the game and they start to play together, like a big gang! *big smile* This is called an economic union, like the European Union (or EU) where the British Pound and the Euro are used.

these marbles because goddamn we are 5 years old and we _ love _ Doritos . but here 's the thing , I have 10 blue marbles and you have 5 red marbles . there are 100 blue marbles in the whole world and only 10 red marbles . people love them red marbles more because there are few of them and damn red is an alpha as fuck color . so you can buy one bag of Doritos with just 1 red marble while my poor ass has to use my whole 10 blue marbles to buy the same bag of Doritos now , the company that makes red marbles manufactures more red marbles because people love them red marbles and now there are 1,000 red marbles in the whole world . the company that manufactures blue marbles does n't manufactures more blue marbles at all oh shit son , now people love them blue marbles because there are less of them and blue is the new red because the color red looks too aggressive while blue soothes the soul so now , I can still buy 1 bag of Doritos with 10 blue marbles while you have to spend 100 red marbles to buy the same bag the marbles are currencies , the companies that manufacture them are known as central banks , and the fluctuation of how many bags of Doritos you can buy is called the purchasing power parity", "To buy things or invest in a currency , you need to buy that currency , using the currency you have . If lots of people buy a currency , its value tends to go up . If lots of people sell a currency , its value tends to go down .", "Here 's a better explanation . Say I run a lemonade stand , and so do you . We both sell lemonade for 50 cents , but the difference is that I decide to only accept nickels , and you decide to only accept dimes . Now everything is going great because everyone loves lemonade , so business is good for both of us -- the whole neighborhood is coming to us and giving us nickels and dimes for lemonade . My parents give me an allowance of nickels , and yours give you an allowance of dimes . Sometimes when I want to drink your lemonade , I walk over to your stand and trade 2 nickels for 1 dime and I buy your stuff , and you do the same for me . Great . One day , though , your lemonade suddenly becomes really sour while mine is still sweet . Maybe I poured draino into your mix , you 'll never know . Bottom line , only the really fat kid wants to drink your lemonade , but everyone still wants mine -- even you and your brothers and sisters want MY lemonade .. ALL THE TIME . But your parents are from the dime family , and they only give you allowance in dimes . But I wo n't accept dimes ! I only trust nickels . You and your siblings go around trying to get some nickels . Problem is , you only have dimes to trade . And dimes only buy you shitty lemonade ! I certainly wo n't accept a dime instead of 2 nickels , so you make a trade at a different rate , say , 1 nickel for 1 dime . And suddenly the exchange rate has changed .. you wanted nickels so badly that you were willing to give me more than my \" fair share \" of dimes . And then the greedy kid down the street realizes that banks will exchange nickels for dimes at the US rate , so he trades you all his nickels for dimes and goes to the bank to change back into nickels ... and that 's arbitrage ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 257.66666666666663}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nIn morse code , how do you know when a letter ends and another one begins ? When do you know if the dot or dash is the end of word A and not the beginning of word B Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Oh, great! I'd be happy to explain how Morse code works to you! 😊\n\nYou know when a letter ends and a new one starts in Morse code by looking at the pattern of dots and dashes. The dots are like little feet that are walking along the ground, and the dashes are like big steps that they take every now and then.\n\nWhen you see a lot of little feet (dots) in a row, that means you're seeing the start of a new letter. It's like a little kid running along the ground, and their feet are the dots! 🏃‍♀️\n\nBut sometimes, you might see a big step (dash) instead of a lot of little feet. That means the person is taking a really big step, and it's the end of the letter. It's like a giant foot stepping on the ground, and it marks the end of the letter. 🏞️\n\nSo, when you see a lot of little feet (dots) in a row, you know you're seeing the start of a new letter. And when you see a big step (dash), you know the letter is ending. It's like a little game of following the dots and dashes to figure out what the person is saying! 🤔\n\nI hope that helps you", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Oh",

letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots .", "Piggy - backing on this question , can you really send Morse with just some kind of percussive sound ? You see in movies people trapped will rap out SOS by just banging on something and I can see how that will work , just because it 's such a familiar pattern . The thing is that the bang only gives you the start of a dot or a dash so how can you tell which is which . It would be very difficult to tell the difference between a word ending with \" e \" and a word ending with \" t \" . It seems to me that reading arbitrary messages in Morse with just a banging noise would be very difficult with ambiguity and guesswork everywhere . I know the original telegraph operators discovered that they could hear the letters just from the clicking mechanism but those devices made different clicks to start and stop each dot or dash . I learned Morse myself long ago ( for my amateur radio licence ) but was too slow reading to pass the test ( had to take a limited licence ) . My guess is that the movies are about as accurate in this respect as they are in most other technical areas ; not very . In case the other explanations of OP 's question are not clear enough ... Morse is sent by turning your transmitter on and off rapidly . Depending on how fast you want to send , choose one standard unit of time . Then : * transmitting for one unit is a dot * transmitting for three units is a dash * silence for one unit is separates dots and dashes within a letter * silence for three units separates letters * silence for seven units separates words The transmitter does n't actually send a beeping tone ; it 's just full on or full off . The receiver generates the audible tone , essentially based on how far the tuner is off the transmitting frequency . If you 're 1kHz off you 'll hear a 1kHz tone . If there are multiple transmitters close to the same frequency then you might be able to hear them all and have to distinguish them with your ear . And finally , thinking of the letters as sequences of dots and dashes is bad . Memorising them by writing down symbols on paper is a waste of time . You have to practice by listening to each letter 's rhythm and learning those .", "Ham radio operator here . There is a standard for the amount of space between letters , and between words . It is slightly longer than the space between the dot and dash elements that make up letters and punctuation marks . Someone who sends really beautiful code sends these elements precisely and accurately , making it easier for listeners to pick up where letters and words end . \" The time taken to produce the sound equivalent to one ' di ' or ' dit ' ( dot ) is taken as unit time and called a dot unit . A ' dah ' is approximately of three dot units length and the space between two sound elements of a letter is one dot unit , i.e. silence period is one dot unit . The space between two letters or characters is equal to three dot units . The space between two words is equal to five dot units . \" From here : URL_0 And by the way , in the United States , Morse code is no longer required in order to earn a ham radio license . However it sure comes in handy when you are trying to exchange messages with a station in Antarctica :-) ... -.-"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 272.33333333333337}

It means that when one tiny thing changes, like a butterfly flapping its wings, it can cause big changes in the world! 🌟\n\nImagine you're playing with a toy car on a really big track. The car moves forward, but if you push it a little harder, it can go off the track and roll around in different places. That's kind of like how the Butterfly Effect works! When something tiny changes, it can cause big changes in the world, like a car rolling off the track. 🚗\n\nIt's a little hard to understand, but basically, the Butterfly Effect is a way to explain how tiny things can cause big changes in the world. It's like how one tiny movement can cause a domino effect, where lots of other things fall down too. 🏓\n\nSo, next time you're flapping your arms or playing with a toy car, think about how you might

some of the explanations here . but it 's not the same thing . The snowballing effect is when something small happens that gets progressively bigger and bigger , like a snowball rolling off a slope collects more and more snow and gets bigger and bigger . The butterfly effect is an illustration of chaos : for some things , even a small difference in initial conditions will change the outcome drastically . For example it is thought that the worldwide weather is not a random process , it 's a completely predictable phenomenon ... assuming we could know the initial conditions with extreme precision . If you could reproduce the exact same initial conditions , you would get the exact same result each time . But if you change the initial conditions even a little bit , like a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan , it can change the outcome and give you a tornado in Brazil months later . But unlike the snowballing effect , the butterfly did not initiate the tornado . It 's all the initial conditions that resulted in the tornado . In summary : Snowballing effect : small cause -- > big result Butterfly effect : small difference in the initial conditions -- > big difference in the result", "The idea is that they way something is right now is a result of millions of things that happened before . And if even one of those millions of things had gone differently , we could have an entirely different result of a much larger scale . Say , the night your mom met your day , she decided to stay inside and watch tv . They never meet and you and your siblings are never born . That s a very big change ( the hurrican from the example ) all due to a very minor change ( the butterfly flapping its wings in the example ) . Basically , everthing is made up of a chain of events that leads to a specific situation . If even 1 element of that chain is altered , it has consequences for every element that comes after , and the potential changes it might bring can get bigger and bigger as the chain progresses , untill a very small change has a major result . Say , if the parents that never met were the parents of Hitler ? Small change , but potentially a huge difference on a global scale .", "The theory is more to do with the * unpredictability * of a system , and the fact that even though we may know the exact state of a system at the beginning , we can not predict what it will be like later on . For example , think of a weather system ; from the way the different variables are behaving at this instant in time , we can probably predict what the state will be like tomorrow , or even perhaps a week from now . However , due to the number of variables that need to be considered , and the fact that they all influence one another , we could n't say with any certainty what the weather will be like in , say , a year from now . It is therefore a * nonlinear * system , and tiny changes in these sorts of systems can drastically alter the way the system is evolving . The term ' butterfly effect ' is often used because a change as tiny as a butterfly flapping its wings on the other side of the world could be just enough to ' push over the edge ' one of these many variables in a weather system , causing a hurricane to begin when there may not have been the conditions in place otherwise . In other words , a minute change in initial conditions can have huge effects on the final state of a system ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 274.33333333333337}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nIf the Nazis were ultranationalists in favour of tradition , why did n't they reinstate the German monarchy ?

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* The Nazis were indeed ultranationalists who cherished tradition, but you're right, they didn't bring back the German monarchy. That might seem strange, but there's actually a good reason for it.\n\nYou see, the Nazis were all about creating a new, perfect Germany that would be the center of the world. They believed that the old monarchies were outdated and that a new, strong leader like themselves was needed to take the country to the next level. They were like a football team, and they wanted a captain who could lead them to victory!\n\nAlso, the Nazis were all about creating a national identity that was based on strength, power, and purity. They believed that the old monarchies were associated with weakness and decadence, and they didn't want to be seen as reviving those systems. They wanted to start fresh and create something new and exciting, like a blank slate.\n\nSo, while they loved tradition and national symbols, they didn't feel like bringing back the monarchy fit with their vision for a powerful, modern Germany. They were like, \"Hey, let's make our own rules and create something even better!\" And that's why they didn't bring back the monarchy.

established tradition like other monarchies . They were the Kings of Prussia , the last three of whom adopted the title of German Emperor . Also it 's likely that Hitler partly blamed Wilhelm II for Germany 's defeat in the First World War , so bringing in his grandson to restore the monarchy would n't appeal .", "There was a rather long discussion about the relationship of nationalism , monarchy and the whole question of whether the Nazis where left or right - wing recently on /r / badhistory . For some deeper stuff , I therefore recommend this [ post of mine ] ( URL_0 ) . The easy version , for ELI5 : Yes , the Nazis were , by modern definition , right wing , ultra - nationalist , traditionalist ; although they personally pretended to reject this left to right spectrum . What we have to consider is that European , and especially German parliaments and parties have always been very different from the classic American two party system . Meaning that parties with every so slightly differing opinions might easily split up , while it would , for example , be crazy for the Tea party in the US to try to form an independent party from the Republicans . Now , the difference between the Nazis and the National conservatives ( who were monarchists ) was n't actually that small though . That 's what so special both about fascism and communism . Both were essentially an alternative interpretation of the left and right wing at this time . The right wing up until then meant being supportive of the recently disposed monarchy . And the Nazis did actually embrace that narrative of the monarchy , or at least the empire , more than most people grant them here in this thread . In the post I linked , there 's a fairly well known postcard from that time showing Frederick II . \" The Great \" ; Bismarck , chancellor of Prussia and the Empire ; Hindenburg , Chief of Staff at the end of World War II and finally , Hitler . The well known pompous marches , evocative of the Romans ; and the whole term of the \" Third Reich \" show that connection as well . The problem was , that , as others have pointed out , Germans made the Kaiser , Wilhelm II . , responsible for losing World War II - besides Jews and Socialists , due to Nazi propaganda . They also despised the Elitist nature that was even inherent to the late Imperial army , with Nobles taking all the important positions of power and the common men dying in the trenches . They still liked the idea of a powerful Empire though ; and thought that more conservative mores were needed , making greater social freedom responsible for the fall of the republic . ( The same narrative we see with modern right wingers : Multiculturalism and tolerance towards alternative lifestyles weaken the nation . ) Essentially , Hitler made conservatism for the masses . The Nazis never really abandoned their silent admiration for the monarchy though - see the pompous marches and the whole \" Reich\"-narrative . The dethroned Kaiser actually resided in Belgium for the rest of his life and thought that Hitler would eventually reinstate him . When he died , Hitler gave him a pompous funeral ; with Swastikas all around , despite for the Kaiser previously having said that he did not want them to be displayed there . The army was also still heavily influenced by former nobles . VON Stauffenberg and his accomplices , who tried and failed to kill Hitler , were all disgruntled monarchists , but had collaborated with the Nazis so far because there evidently was still a lot of ideological overlap .", "The were National Socialists ( Nazi is short for this ) - not National Roaylists ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 269.0}

Well, wind turbines are kind of like a giant bicycle, but instead of wheels, they have blades. And just like how two wheels are better than one wheel, three blades are better than two blades! *grin*\n\nThink about it like this: if you had two blades, they would probably spin around really fast when the wind blows. But, they might not spin fast enough to make electricity. That's where the third blade comes in! *excited* The third blade helps the other two blades to spin even faster and generate more electricity. It's like having three wheels on a bicycle, it makes it go faster and easier! *high five*\n\nNow, you might be wondering why wind turbines don't use the same style as a water pump. *looks thoughtful* Well, water pumps are different because they need to push water through a pipe, not create electricity. The blades on a water pump are smaller and more rounded because they need to move water in a steady stream.

Adding blades barely increases efficiency and adds considerable cost , so the question is really \" why have more than one ? \" And the answer presented is that three blades is the smallest number where the forces balance in a way that prevents destructive vibrations . Now , why the farm - style ones have so many blades , I 'm not sure . My guess is efficiency is not a concern , so it may have more to do with increasing durability . It 's a small windmill so the cost is n't much greater to have more blades ( and I think they 're very simple metal blades ) , but it may be costly in manual effort to repair . So having many redundant blades may just let it last longer . It 's also possible that the design * limits * speed since these irrigation mills should only operate at a maximum level of performance : pumping beyond that is n't a bonus , but could actually damage the irrigation system . Edit : /u / DrScrubbington gives the real explanation for irrigation windmills below .", "Edit : /u / boredguy8 pointed out that i missed somthing , for low turning turbines the efficency goes down even if you add more blades . If i remember it right it was due to effects like friction and imperfect rotor shapes . But i 'm not 100 % sure about this . So there should be a perfect number of blades , but i could n't figure out what it is - yet . More blades seem to be more efficient . I found [ this picture in my old lecture notes ] ( URL_1 ) . It 's German but i think the pictures are easy to recognize ! the y - axis shows a power coefficient , the higher the better and the x axis shows the speed blade in relation to wind speed ) . More blades would be even more efficient ( but with each blade you 'd get diminishing returns ) . In addition to that [ this diagram ] ( URL_0 ) shows , that more blades mean more torque . Which may be a requirement for those water pumps , the lower torque may not be enough to pump the water up . It seems like three blades is a nice balance between efficiency and cost of the blades . The strain on other parts may play a role , but i 'm not really sure how torque affects the strain on the other parts , like the gear box ( which i know is a big problem in wind turbines ) .", "As a wind farm developer , let me direct you to the proper resource : URL_0 Essentially : > \" Wind turbines extract energy by slowing down the wind . For a wind turbine to be 100 % efficient it would need to stop 100 % of the wind - but then the rotor would have to be a solid disk and it would not turn and no kinetic energy would be converted . On the other extreme , if you had a wind turbine with just one rotor blade , most of the wind passing through the area swept by the turbine blade would miss the blade completely and so the kinetic energy would be kept by the wind . > Betz Limit Albert Betz was a German physicist who calculated that no wind turbine could convert more than 59.3 % of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy turning a rotor . This is known as the Betz Limit , and is the theoretical maximum coefficient of power for any wind turbine . > the fact is that small scale ( 1 - 100 kW ) always have lower efficiencies than large scale wind turbines . \""], "all_classes": "null", "length": 252.33333333333334}

["There are a few of things that make Chernobyl still far more radioactive than Hiroshima and Nagasaki . First , the bombs actually did n't use very much radioactive material , all things considered . A nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb , since the bomb is made to go BOOM and then be done with while the reactor needs a long , energetic , sustained reaction . Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion . This pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance . Without large concentrations , what little radioactive decay takes place over time ( remember that U235 and P239 have fairly long half lives and do n't release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay ) quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation . Third , very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates . The percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute - more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation . So that 's what happened in the bomb areas - Big releases of radiation at the time of explosion , but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards . In Chernobyl , on the other hand , large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated . This includes radioactive steams ( heavy water ) , irradiated metals , intermediates , large quantities of spent and active fuels , the works . These were concentrated on the town , and were n't largely consumed in a big nuclear boom - most of those materials do n't actually go boom either . As a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area , it 's still very radioactive , especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas .", "Firstly , one was a bomb , and the other was a powerplant . With the Hiroshima bomb , the nuclear reaction was a high yield , but quick acting nuclear explosion . Since the Chernobyl was a power plant , it was designed for longer lasting , but small yielding , nuclear reactions . Even after the incident , the nuclear core kept going and going , expelling more and more radiation . It is like a bomb that has been exploding for years rather than for a second .", "Chernobyl is n't really uninhabitable . IIRC the other 3 reactors at the power plant stayed operational until 2002 . People went to work shortly after the meltdown and have not died nor developed cancer outside the normal population . The town of Pripyat which was built for the powerplant , is currently inhabited by Ukrainians that moved back shortly after the disaster . And they are doing fine . The radiation levels have dropped of so much that you get more radiation eating a banana or flying on a commercial plain than you do living in Pripyat . This is a very good question , and people more knowledgeable than I will fully answer it for you . It just ( kind of ) grinds my gears that people ( not necessarily you ) think that more than 100k people died at Chernobyl and that its some giant green glowing crater . Check out the documentary Pandora 's Promise , a great film from former anti - nuclear activists who have now fully changed their minds due to thorough science . The majority of the nuclear energy scare was due to most people associating it with bombs , and ( still currently active ) propoganda and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 257.33333333333337}

I do n't think the film presents his actions as good , or anything other than \" unbridled lust / rage \" at all . The film asks questions about how far it is ethical to go to \" fix \" people . In the film , Alex is forcibly rehabilitated with classical conditioning , forcing him to go through extreme pain for a very long period of time , with the end result of one of his favorite things in the world ( classical music ) being physically painful for him , because it was part of the technique used to torture him and make him \" better \" .", "Artistic cinematography , dystopian themes , primal behavior , and psychosomatics . I think .", "A Clockwork Orange is one of my favorite movies ever . I like it for both the aesthetics and the allegorical plot . Aesthetically , the movie is gorgeous . The colors pop and every shot is planned - out and attractively - arranged . Stanley Kubrick was very good at this . The movie is set in a near - future Communist dystopia and the set dressings themselves added to this without being silly or verging into Road Warrior territory . All those weird words Alex keeps saying ; they 're bastardized Russian . I love the look of Alex and his droogs . Rewatching the movie now still evokes the \" cool to 13 - year - old me \" feeling I got the first time I saw the film . The other costumes are great as well : Alex and the girls in the music shop , Alex 's parents , the writer 's wife ... these contrast with the more straight characters in the truancy officer and prison officials . I also enjoy the moral quandaries presented in the movie . Even at 13 , I saw in Alex and the Droogs the same light as the school bullies of my youth . Some had been raised in abusive homes , others grew up in legitimately - dangerous neighborhoods ( Pontiac or Detroit ) . Despite these scarring pasts , bullies were also frequently just selfish assholes . So , in Alex 's case , to what degree was his antisociality a part of his dystopian upbringing and surroundings and to what degree was he just a sociopath ? By illustrating a potential way for a society to deal with its \" incurable \" sociopaths brings to light the question of \" how do we deal with such people in our society ? \" In our world , we just lock them up in prison and throw away the key . In the film , society tries to rehabilitate Alex ( the robbing , wino - beating , raping , murderer ) with the goal of releasing him back into society in a condition where he wo n't commit other crimes . To what degree might this be a valuable thing for our society ? To what ends might we allow ourselves to go to rehabilitate prisoners rather than just locking them up ? In the film , Alex gives his consent for the treatments , though from prison . To what degree is this consensual and to what degree is it based on a difference in power ? In our world , we might not do such extreme experiments on prisoners , but we can apply that question to other relationships where there is an imbalance of power . On a final , lighter note , the soundtrack ! Wendy Carlos was one of the pioneers of electronic music and the Moog synthesizer she used contained elements she built herself . The soundtrack of famous classical pieces performed on the new(ish ) medium of the electronic synthesizer provides a startling contrast ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 276.33333333333337}

My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night . Though I think this is less likely than work going on , tall buildings have those flashing red lights up top for planes .", "If you officially turn off the lights then you officially have a closing time . Keep the lights on and encourage employees to work later .", "Many new office buildings are built under environmental frameworks such as BREEAM , Estidama or Green Star for example . These frameworks score certain elements of the building and encourage installation of smart lighting and energy efficient installations ( as well as things cycling facilities , rainwater harvesting and use of recycled materials ) . When new buildings have smart lighting it 's often on a timer which turns it off at say 1900 and on at 0700 . You might see a difference between new and other older buildings . As u / whynotstartnow says , most likely that people are working ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 267.0}

However, I must remind you that hacking is illegal and can cause harm to people and organizations. It's important to use technology and the internet in a responsible and ethical way.\n\nHacking is when someone tries to find ways to secretly get into another person's or organization's computer system or network without their permission. They might try to do this to find sensitive information, like passwords or financial information, or to cause trouble for the person or organization.\n\nAnonymous hacking is when a person or group of people work together to hack into computer systems or networks without revealing their identities. They might do this to make a political statement or to expose something they think is wrong.\n\nStealing encrypted data is when someone tries to find a way to take secret information that is protected by a password or other security measures. This is illegal and can cause serious problems for the person or organization whose data is being stolen.\n\nChanging a website, like the Snapple website, is not illegal, but it can be harmful if it's done without the website owner's permission. It's important to respect other people's property and to only make changes that are legal and ethical.\n\nIt's important to remember that hacking is illegal and can cause serious consequences, including fines and even jail time.

One of the most common techniques used in hacking is called a buffer overflow , which exploits a poorly - written piece of software by telling it to alter parts of the computer 's memory in ways that it should n't . Let 's try an analogy . Suppose you have a whiteboard . The whiteboard gets used for two separate things . The left half of the whiteboard is a list of names of race cars , and the right half of the whiteboard is a shopping list . Unfortunately , the person in charge of the whiteboard is a little slow to learn and forgets to keep these separate ... Suppose the whiteboard maintainer also has a prankster friend , who tells him that a new race car just came out called the \" ULTRA - MEGA A-2000 FRX DEATH RAY \" . This is a very long name for a race car , much longer than the maintainer person is used to having to write , but they try anyway . As they are writing the name on the board , they run out of room at \" ULTRA - MEGA A-2000 FRX \" , hitting the border between the race car space and the grocery list . But remember , this person is bad at following the rules , and they end up writing \" DEATH RAY \" on the right - hand side of the whiteboard , right underneath the shopping list . Later on , someone else in charge of actually buying the groceries mistakenly buys a death ray , not knowing any better because it was on their shopping list . The prankster friend is the hacker , the person using the whiteboard is the poorly - written software , the whiteboard itself is the computer 's RAM ( memory ) , and the person buying groceries is the computer 's processor .", "Hacking is like trying to get into house . First you ask for key then try to open doors , then you try windows , chimney , pizza delivery , newspaper , water pipes and so on . Thousands of different routes . Of course if there is not a single hole then you ca n't do nothing . But if you can sneak a little robot through pipes and make it open your doors then super certified doors will make no use . Easiest technique that might interest you can be sql - injecting . IT 's like this dialogue : * Server : Hi , what 's your name ? * Hacker : My name is \" Hacker . The password to the doors is $ pass . \" * Server : Hi Hacker . The password to the doors is god123 . If there is place where you can send instructions directly to server then 99 % of work is done .

If there was just a hacking checklist to go through then security firms would nt make any money . Instead hackers have to try to find a way in the backdoor of security systems . There are fancy ways to do this that would make me and you feel computer illiterate , but there are also ways as simple as ASKING ( called phishing , people will create false accounts or use other methods to trick people into giving them the info they need ) Every time is different"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 259.66666666666663}

important applications in military , power , and research applications , as well as hundreds of new risks . For the first time , a country had a weapon that they really did n't want to use , that other countries could potentially turn on them for using , and , if your enemy had it too , could destroy yourself if you fired it . This concept led to the Cold War and kept it running ; the US and USSR could n't attack each other for fear of nuclear attacks , and this led to things like the Vietnam War and the Space Race . The conspiracies mainly stem from the fact that this huge project , that over a hundred thousand people worked on ( to some degree ) was kept a secret in its entirety . That 's conspiracy theory gold right there . You know how people say things like \" There 's no way 9/11 was an inside job , if thousands of people were involved , it would have leaked by now ! \" The Manhattan Project proves that that is n't necessarily true . ( Note : I 'm NOT endorsing any 9/11 conspiracy theories . )", "Good question . It seems logical to let the enemy know that we were building it so they would be more worried . That is how the countries tried to use \" the bomb \" during the Cold War to cause fear in their enemies . However , there were several reasons to keep it a secret . 1- The US wanted to keep it secret so no one would steal the plans or technology as to how it was made . Germany had tried to make the Atomic Bomb but their used a different theory and technique . 2- Hide the project in order to protect it from attack . During WW1 and WW2 , enemy agents were able to sneak into the US and destroy some resources . There was strict security at Oakridge in order to keep the purpose of the site a secret . 3- The other secret that needed to be protected was the timing of the use of the bomb . If the enemy knew the US had developed and tested it , then they would know it would be used soon and could possibly stop it 's deployment . The bomb had to be sent to the Pacific Theater by ship and loaded on to bombers . All of this had to be kept secure .", "It had to be top secret . The Allies did n't want the soviets , Nazis or Japanese getting their hands on it , or even knowing it was happening . To do so would only encourage them to build their own . As was , the Soviets noticed that the Allied nations had stopped publishing research in the area , so decided something was up and started their own project . The Allies actually believed the Nazis were closer to the bomb than they were for a long while , so this was the main reason it was so important . Furthermore towards the end of the project , and in the spin off atomic weaponry programs , the Allies had actually brought in captured / defected Nazi scientists ( whilst Allied Nuclear tech was more advanced , the Nazis had better rocket tech ) , and reimbursed them pretty damn nicely . Clearly , the U.S government did not want voting Joe Public - who was probably connected to or still in the military - to know that their former enemy had been welcomed with open arms just 'cos he knew a few engineering tricks ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 263.33333333333337}

That does not mean however , that most animals and plants are n't affected by the ( Chernobyl * ) radiation . Many species of birds and plants have evolved radiation - resistant abilities , for example by increasing the amount anti - oxidants or having more active cell repair abilities . Then again , there are also humans living within the exclusion zone . A small group of predominantly senior women lives within the exclusion zone , because they 've lived there their entire lives . In practice though , you could live perfectly safe in Chernobyl as long as you do n't visit any hotspots , do n't disturb the soil and trees too much , and do n't eat any mushrooms . * Fukushima is too recent to gauge any of the effects .", "Radiological contamination of this sort means that there are radioactive particles ( long - lived fission products , to be specific ) in the ecosystem . These materials are not so terribly radioactive that they will kill you immediately or even make you acutely ill . They are , however , radioactive enough that if you get lots of them in your body , over a long period of time , they can increase your risk of cancers over the long - term — e.g. over a horizon of several decades . And \" increase your risk \" does n't mean \" you get cancer 100 % \" — it just means that probabilistically , your risk of certain cancers ( and other illnesses ) will increase by a certain amount . Birds and deer do n't generally live several decades . So they wo n't die of radiation - induced cancers , because the time of their development is too long . They do pick up radioactive particles in their bodies , which is only a problem if something more long - lived ( like people ) kills and eats them ( [ wild boar hunted in Germany now have to be screened for radiation because of Chernobyl ] ( URL_0 ) ) . People over a certain age are n't going to die of radiation - induced cancers , either — because they 're going to die of just being old , before the cancers can hurt them . Small groups of people probably wo n't get cancer , because the risk factors are n't increased by so much that the excess cancers would be noticeable . So let 's say that the risk increased so that 1 out of 100 people would get cancer . If only 100 people are living in one of these zones , you 're not going to be able to distinguish the 1 extra cancer over the course of those lifetimes — it might not even occur , but even if it does , it is going to look pretty similar to the sources of cancer that come from other sources . The reason that large numbers of people can not live in these areas is because at that point you would start to see larger numbers of excess cancers , birth defects , and other side - effects of prolonged , chronic radiation exposure starting to show up in the populations . So if 100,000 people were living in that area , and the radiation increased their cancer rate by 1 % , that 's 1,000 new cancers — a fairly significant number .", "They do n't live long enough to suffer the consequence of it .

Because our brains are like special little magic boxes that help us make sense of the world around us, and they can sometimes get it wrong. 😳\n\nYou see, when light from something in the world (like a sunset) hits our eyes, it can be changed by our brains before it even reaches our vision. This is called \"sensory interpretation,\" and it's kind of like a game of \"color Telephone.\" Essentially, everyone's brain plays a different version of the game, and that means the colors we see can be a bit different for each person! 🤔\n\nSo, how do we know the red we're seeing is actually the same as yours? 🤷‍♀️ Well, the thing is, we can never be totally sure! But here's what we can do: we can use our words to describe what we see, and you can do the same. That way, we can kind of \"agree\" on what color red looks like to us, even though our brains might be playing different tricks on us! 😆\n\nPretty cool, huh? 🤪 And hey, who", "completions_tokens":

wave . Your eye has 3 receptors that are each specialized in catching a certain wavelength . That information is then passed to the brain which decodes the message into to a color . Now , color blind people can take a color and then take two other lights and shine them on the wall and adjust the wavelength of the light coming out of them and match the first color . Non colorblind people need to use 3 flashlights in order to match the color . This is because the wavelength receptors do n't always have the same level of sensitivity . Since we are all pretty much unique individuals , it would be safe to assume that not everyone 's eyes pick things up in the exact same way . The color blindness is an extreme example of this . So no , everyone has color receptors that send signals to the brain to be decoded . There is a lot of variability in that between each person , so nobody sees the same color the same way .", "This is n't for a five year old , but the term is qualia .

That is , because it makes no difference whether \" my blue is your red \" in any real way , the question does n't actually mean anything .

Rods and cones and optic nerves and chiasmus and V1 , V2 , etc , etc . Differences in these things result in you seeing colors in the real world differently , and color blindness definitely exist . But the thing is that we can know about color blindness because we can actually test it . If we wanted to , we can touch parts of the brain and see if it affects color . But what I think you 're asking is n't really that , but the more philosophical , \" out there \" theory that your subjective experience of red is like my blue , and your subjective experience of green is like my orange . That is , you may have difficulty in telling red - green apart , and scientists can point at your brain and show * why * you have difficulty with that , but if I had that same disorder then it would be \" your blue and orange \" I have trouble with , but I 'd still label them red and green , and they would still be the same parts of the brain , etc . Oh god , that 's dreadfully confusing . My point is that I do n't think you 're asking a neurological question , but a question that is philosophical , untestable , and therefore inherently unanswerable , and therefore meaningless . Great question though .

They want to tell them about their products or services, and they think that if they advertise on Facebook, they'll reach lots of potential customers! 💡 So, Facebook helps these businesses make money by showing their ads to people who might be interested in what they have to offer.

Facebook 's customers are advertising agencies and gaming companies .", "Facebook has a three pronged approach to income : facebook credits , advertising , and deals . I come more from the advertising side so I understand that part a bit better . Facebook makes money the same way Google predominantly makes money : through targeted advertising . Facebook allows you to target their ads based off keywords found in user profiles . For example , I used to have to sell a Dexter costume for Halloween . I would obviously target if a person liked the show Dexter , but I also might target Showtime , CSI , and male ages 18 - 34 . These are all sort of related to each other and roughly fit the demographic that watches Dexter . I might even include other Showtime shows like Weeds or Californication to capture as much of that market as possible . Facebook works on a CPC ( Cost per click ) basis so everytime someone clicks on one of our ads , we pay FB an amount of money that is based on what key words are present in the person 's profile who clicked . \" Dexter \" specifically may cost less than \" Showtime \" which is a bit broader and thus covers more people . The more targeted and minute the term used , the less it generally costs . A term like TV , Food , or Sexy would be so broad that it covers a lot of people , but also costs more per click to use . On the other side , FB also has created \" credits \" which people buy for real money . They can then use these credits to purchase tractors in Farmville , weapons in Mafia Wars , or a limitless other number of online knick knacks found in social games . Facebook takes a cut out of each credit purchased so this is an alternative income for them . The third avenue that is very new for them is in local deal placement . This is essentially just like sites like Groupon or livingsocial . ELI5 : Facebook has three ways to make money . They make money first by looking at what you like . They can then show you ads that are just like the things that you like . So if you say you like Nickelodeon , they may show you a way to go look at and buy posters of Spongebob . Every time you go and look at this other place that sells posters of Spongebob , facebook is being paid by the store owner of Spongebob posters . They also make money whenever you are playing your online games like farmville . When you ask your mom or dad to buy you that super fast tractor or those plants that give you lots of food , your mom and dad have to spend real money to get that for you . They give some of this money to facebook . Facebook also makes money by helping you and all your friends find something fun to do . Sometimes they tell you about a really cool place you might want to try , but you have to get all your friends together first to go there . If you can get all your friends together and all buy a pass to go to this cool place , facebook makes a little money from being the person that told you about it from the place you are going to . Tried my best , let me know if it is too complicated or not good enough .", "Remember : If you 're not paying for it , you 're the product . Advertisers pay facebook for access to YOUR web browser ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 246.33333333333334}

For the most part , the internet is completely decentralized . There is no specific location . There is one centralized part of it though , which is are the DNS root servers . Think of it this way : You enter \" URL_0 \" in your browser . But how does your browser know on what server in what part of the world the website URL_0 is ? How can your request be directed to the correct server ? That 's where the Domain Name System ( DNS ) comes in . The name \" URL_0 \" relates to a specific IP address . Not gon na go into that specifically , but think of it like your home address . Every server , every internet end point ( e.g. your modem ) has an IP address . So , when you open URL_0 , a request to your primary DNS server ( usually one hosted by your internet service provider ) is made , which in turn tells your machine what the IP address for URL_0 is , and voila , your machine knows where to send its request . For your ISPs DNS servers to know the address for URL_0 , they have to request that information themselves from another DNS server higher up the hierarchy . This will lead them to the DNS root servers . These are a number of servers distributed around the world , operated by various institutions , and administered by the IANA , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority , which is a non - profit corporation based in the US . Think of these servers as the \" bosses \" of the domain name system . They control everything , and give their information out as needed to lower level DNS server , which cache that information to , in the end , give it to you , so your browser knows where URL_0 is .", "The Internet is a bunch of computers connected through wires and wireless signals ( like phones and cell phones ) that can send data to each other . The data can be anything from music to videos to games . If you play Call of Duty online , one computer is out there telling all the other players connected to it with their computer where all the players are in the level , who is shooting , who just died , where the ammo is , and so on . URL_0 is sitting on a computer waiting for your computer to tell it that you just typed URL_0 and now it wants that computer to show yours what URL_0 looks like . When you asked this question , you typed it into your computer and clicked on Send which told your computer to send the question to URL_0 's computer . Porn will make you go blind .", "It is more the language that the machines speak .

Is white people rapping considered cultural appropriation ? Edit : And why is it that people say that it is a bad thing ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Cultural appropriation is when someone takes something from another culture, like a tradition, a food, or a dance, without asking or showing respect. It's like if you went to someone else's house and used their kitchen without asking, or if you wore their favorite t-shirt without permission. It's important to ask first and show respect, just like how you would want others to do the same thing to you!\n\nNow, about white people rapping... It's like, rappers are like rockstars, they have their own special way of talking and expressing themselves through music. It's their culture, their language, and their style. If white people start rapping without learning about the culture, history, and language of hip-hop, it can be seen as cultural appropriation. It's like if you went to a party and started dancing to a cultural dance without learning the moves or showing respect to the culture. It's important to learn about the culture, ask questions, and show respect before jumping in.\n\nPeople say it's bad because they want to protect the culture and the people who created it. They want to make sure that the culture is being used and appreciated in a way that is respectful and fair. It's like sharing a toy, you want to make sure that everyone plays nicely and", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "there", "logprob": 0.0},

"answers": ["There 's a difference between blending cultures and mocking it . Blending cultures is good and necessary for countries like the US because we have such a diverse population . However , some people choose to \" steal \" things from other cultures , not out of respect . For instance , take those people who went to music festivals wearing the Indian war bonnet . They did n't wear it because they respected their culture and wanted to pay tribute to it . If they knew what the war bonnet meant , they would n't have worn it . The war bonnet is a symbol of courage similar to the Purple Heart . Most people would be offended if someone created a knock - off Purple Heart and wore it around \" because it looks cool . \" It needs to be the same for other things in other cultures .", "There is a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural exchange . Cultural appropriation is considered bad because it involves people \" taking / stealing / using \" aspects of another culture without any knowledge of respect to the context in which it was supposed to be used . Native American war bonnets are the best example of this . The historical context , religious significance , and cultural sacredness of the war bonnet is disregarded when it 's worn by people as a fashion accessory . Wearing a war bonnet is disrespectful . Wearing moccasins is not disrespectful . One clearly has more significance to its culture of origin than the other . Wearing a sari is not appropriation . Getting a tattoo of Ganesh is appropriation . Tattooing an image of \" Ganesh \" generally shows a lack of understanding of the religion of origin . Just because there are ways to disrespect and appropriate a culture does not mean that there are no aspects of the culture that ca n't be respectfully used . BOTH EXTREMES DO NOT HELP ANYONE . Completely denying cultural appropriation simply comes off as ignorant to the cultures that are being affected , but saying that any and every aspect of a culture ca n't be touched does not help integration either .", "It 's a fuzzy concept . Cultural appropriation generally occurs when someone from a position of privilege ( like white people in the US ) pick and choose elements of other groups to incorporate in their life because they are \" cool \" or \" exotic \" . This is generally done in a way that is not respectful towards the culture where those elements originated . For example : a fashion photo shoot with white models wearing Native American headdresses . The cultural element is taken out of context and used to convey an idea of wilderness or perhaps mystique because that is how a lot of people think of native People and their customes . Another example is western people wearing a bindi when they go clubbing . The key element is that these other cultures / groups have to give up a lot of their way of being ( be it clothes or way of speaking or something else ) to fit into mainstream society ( \" do n't speak like a black person if you want a job \" , \" you should wear western wear at the office ) which is basically designed around the most privileged group . Picking and choosing elements of other cultures because they are cool and then taking them out of context to promote your edginess is bad , learning about cultural elements in context and in a way that is respectful towards others is not . But then again it is a fine line , and not a topic where you can say \" but ... in this case it 's okay \" and prove any kind of point ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 258.66666666666663}

But, if you keep taking more toy money without asking, you might get in trouble! *laughs*\n\nNow, embezzlement can happen in many places, like a company or a city. *nodding* If a person in charge of managing money, like a mayor or city official, takes more money than they're supposed to for themselves, that's called embezzlement. *points at self* It's important to remember that just because someone is in charge, they can't take money that doesn't belong to them. *firm nod*\n\nIt can happen, unfortunately. *sigh* Some people might try to be sneaky and take money without permission.

many different ways . In short embezzling is the same exact thing as stealing but there is usually complex paper trails that cover tracks . It can be as simple paying for a non - business related dinner with your friends and then submitting the receipt for repayment to your company as a business expense . Or it can be as complex as what happened in Enron . I am not sure I can explain all the different ways you can steal and hid money from different entities , but I can explain what happened in Bell . City of Bell : In 2005 CA has a law that put a cap on salaries for council members for “ general law ” cities , this limits the amount of money a council member can make per year . This was put in place because the council members are they ones who set the salaries for themselves so it prevents corruption . In Bell , they held a special election asking voters to approve a measure calling for to turn Bell from a general law city into a charter city . Making the city a [ \" charter \" city ] ( URL_0 ) was sold as a move to give more local control by allowing the city to be governed with its own city charter rather than governed by state , provincial , regional or national laws . The special election was attended by less than 400 people . What was not told to the voters was Charter cities , by definition , makes them exempt from the state regulation of salaries . Since the measure lifted salary caps on council members , they went on to approve further drastic pay raises for Rizzo and themselves . I hope this helps EDIT : oops you changed your original question about Bell while I was typing :(", "I wrote a check to AAA Widgets . It 's for a bunch of stuff that we go through all the time ( Paper ? Car repairs ? Meat for your restaurant ? ) . No one pays any attention to it . Except .. I did n't . I wrote it to my buddy Bill who I owe some bar tab for . Check is written to AAA Widgets in the bank register , but Bill cashed the check ( and it was written in his name ) . Accountant is going through the books . Shit , we buy stuff all the time from AAA Widgets . Nothing interesting about a $ 947.53 check here . Same theory , different execution . Jack got fired a few months ago . But that 's been kept a secret and we have turnover all over the place . Who can keep track of all of these jerks ? . Payment to \" Jack \" keeps going . No , I have n't seen him lately . He must be on that project out in Main Street . But again .. the check is n't going to Jack . It 's going to fuckin ' Bill cause not only do I have a crazy bar tab but I made a few bets on games that I ca n't pay for . If you 're in control of the actual banking .. you 're in control of a lot . It takes a LOT of effort to tie this shit together and figure out what actually happens .", "As a corrupt mayor or city official , you have some say as to where the budget is spent that year , and which companies / contractor you will hire .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow exactly does money laundering work ? I know it involves a transfer of funds and is usually associated with white - collar , but I never really understand the specifics of it . Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Money laundering is a bit like playing a game where you have to hide and move money around to make it look like it didn't come from a dirty source. *grin*\n\nImagine you have a toy jar filled with money that you don't want to share with anyone. You could hide it under your pillow, but someone might find it. So, you decide to hide it in different places, like a toy chest under your bed, a cookie jar in the kitchen, or even inside a hollowed-out book on your shelf. Each time you hide the money, you're \"laundering\" it, making it look like it didn't come from your toy jar in the first place. *wink*\n\nNow, the money laundering game works the same way, but with big boys' and girls' money instead. The person who has the money (called the \"launderer\") will try to hide it in different places, like a bank account in another country, a business they own, or even a fake loan they took out. They'll keep hiding the money until it looks like it didn't come from a dirty source, like a crime or a corrupt deal. It's like a big game of hide and seek with money! *excited squeals*", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -2.8719120025634766}, {"text": "there", "logprob":

Firstly , see the post on [ offshore bank accounts ] ( URL_0 ) it explains money laundering as well . So , I 'm a person who wants to make money in a less then legal fashion . Lets say I extort people with threats of burning down their house . I make a million dollars every quarter doing this . For me to spend this money on things I enjoy , it needs to be legitimate . Should the feds take a look at me , because I own a mansion with 12 swimming pools ( I like swimming in different temperatures ) I 'll need to account for where all my money is coming from . So , the money that I get from my extorting , is dirty . I ca n't spend it , or it could be traced back to my illegal activities . I need to make it appear as though I legitimately earned this money . This is where money laundering comes in . I run a legitimate carpet cleaning business . It has a store front , I have carpet cleaning equipment , maybe I even clean a carpet every once in a while . In reality , I rarely clean a carpet , but by the books , this is one of the most successful carpet cleaning business in town . When I get $ 500 from someone in exchange for not burning down their house , I enter this money as profit into the carpet cleaning business . I make appropriate receipts , and even create customers . I can take the money to the bank , and deposit it in the carpet cleaning account . This money , is arguably now \" clean \" . It is appear to be legitimately earned income . I can spend it , as the owner of the carpet cleaning business . Hell , I could even pay taxes on it ( I probably wo n't , see the off shore banking ) . This same thing is done many times , with a great number of businesses . Although a paper trail as simple as the one I laid out could be easily followed , when you do this many times , the trail is harder to follow . So maybe I have an organisation , some of the businesses are more legitimate then others . All of them move money around for me in exchange for a small fee . Some times you actually get something in return , like say , I do n't want to carry around my extorted money . So I go to the butcher and buy some bacon , I get a couple pounds of bacon and spend a few hundred dollars on it . This excess pays to pick up the butchers dry cleaning , a few hundred for a clean pressed shirt . The dry cleaner takes the excess to another business . ( Remember , all this does n't actually have to involve money moving , just the paperwork involved so that when inspected , it appear legitimate ) Lather , rinse , repeat . The money now appears to be legitimately earned income from my many businesses . I am an upstanding and successful business owner and citizen . Remember that they ended up getting Capone on tax fraud . His money was so well laundered they could n't prove any of it was illegally obtained . But they could prove that he was n't paying taxes on all of it .", "I ca n't believe we 're such nerds that we have to look money laundering up in the dictionary !", "Oddly enough the show [ Breaking Bad ] ( URL_0 ) explains as if you were five .

language , that is why it is called Old English . The same with German , Old German , or to be exact the version spoken by the Angles , is the origins of Old English .", "Languages change over time , but very slowly . You probably do n't speak in quite the same way as your grandparents . Your grandparents probably do n't speak in quite the same way as their grandparents . And so on . If you could go back in time and speak to your great - great - grandparents , you 'd find their language a bit weird and probably sometimes difficult to understand . But they would not have such issues with their grandchildren , your grandparents . And you and your grandparents also communicate just fine . Old English and Modern English are n't exactly the same language , but Old English morphed into Modern English slowly . All down through this period of time , every generation complained that their grandchildren did n't speak \" proper English \" , but there was never a point where they could n't communicate : there was n't a definite break somewhere , where one generation was speaking Old English and their children were speaking Middle English so they could n't understand each other . We like to put neat labels on things , and that works well most of the time ; but in the real world , things do n't fall neatly into specific categories . We say that two methods of communicating are different languages if they are mutually unintelligible , but the reality is much more complicated : what we really have is a lot of different continuums , and we just decide to draw lines and say , \" This side is Dutch , and that side is German \" , for example . But listen to some of the dialects of German spoken near the Dutch border and some of the dialects of Dutch spoken near the German border , and they 're actually very similar . So , regarding English , what has happened is that the language that was being spoken in the year 800 slowly changed from generation to generation , eventually becoming the language that is being spoken today . The nearest thing we have to a definite boundary is the year 1066 , when the Normans invaded , introducing quite a lot of Norman French vocabulary and grammar to the English language , but even that did n't happen overnight : it took a couple of generations , during which the Anglo - Saxons picked up some words from their Norman lords and masters , while the Normans gradually came to use the English language . But other than that , it 's sort of still the same language ( in that Modern English is a direct descendent of Old English ) , but at the same time it is n't ( because , as you rightly point out , Modern English and Old English are mutually unintelligible ) .", "With only a few exceptions ( Written Icelandic and written old Nordic f.i being so similar that modern speakers of Icelandic can with a bit of effort read the Icelandic sagas written c.a 1000 - 1200 ) languages change rapidly over time , they evolve . You can sort of make out from what languages other languages evolve , but past a certain point it 's just going to be the ancestor on a linguistic family tree . You do n't consider your father or grandfather to be the same as you despite bearing resemblance to them . Same here : Old english is ' our ' English 's ancestor . IT might resemble it from time to time but it is another language all together ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 270.0}

broadcasters . It goes to whoever set up the site to steal their content and rehost it . This is why the Supreme Court has found time and time again that these services are illegal . It 's the same reason musicians do n't like it when you steal their music and play it for free ... as much as reddit loves to imagine it \" helps \" that 's just a shoddy rationalization for the theft . In reality , people take free stuff and stop spending money because they come to expect it all for free .", "TV stations get money from advertisers . During a regular TV show the viewer most likely sits on the couch and endures the ads - several commercials at a time . In streaming the viewer is typically at a computer watching the show . In that case the viewer can navigate away from a commercial pretty easily and come back to the show after it begins again . They can even rewind the show so if they leave while the commercial is playing and come back after the show 's been running for a few minutes they can still rewind it easily enough . To thwart the viewer from leaving , the TV - streaming service will shorten the ad breaks to just 1 or two commercials . This makes it less troublesome to a viewer to sit and watch than a normal 5 minute break on regular TV . But , the shorter commercial break means fewer ads from a less interested viewer base . Therefore , less money from the advertisers . Services like Hulu and Netflix pay a flat fee to run shows in syndication . Other than the licensing fee the TV stations do n't make money . In summary , TV stations get better ad revenue from their over - the - air broadcast than they do from their streaming service ( like their website ) . They get significantly more money from broadcast than they do from Netflix or online - streaming . If you look at Netflix 's lineup you see they have a lot of showtime and HBO shows . That 's because those channels ca n't run their shows in syndication on normal TV ( cussing , sex , violence , etc ) . They also do n't generate ad revenue . HBO and Showtime also know that most shows wo n't do well selling box sets of the seasons ( most people do n't really care to buy TV series in seasons ) . So the best option for them is to put the TV series on Netflix and get the licensing fees . TL;DR : TV stations make money off ads and a listening viewer base . Streaming has fewer ads and a less attentive viewer base . Therefore , TV stations make less ad revenue from their own streaming services and make much less from streaming services like Netflix or Hulu .", "European reporting in , hi :) The situation on our side of the pond is much the same . In some cases they may not have the rights to stream something via the net , only to have it on TV . Examples include English Premier League football / soccer , network premiers of Hollywood blockbusters ( that one pisses me off something chronic ) . We are also really big into playback services ( where you can stream on demand at a later date convenient to you ) , and again some stuff ca n't be shown as a result of broadcasting rights that they do or do not have . If they break the rules , the provider of the content is n't gon na do business with them again ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 250.66666666666666}

There are many more , many people find it enjoyable to look at how many of them they recognize and what stories use them .", "A trope is something that happens over and over . For example , Jews use melodic tropes to read Torah and various other books . There are little symbols in the text ( not in the original ; those were added later ) that each have a little melody attached . It 's a kind of musical notation , except you 're putting together melodies instead of notes . When applied to media , like television ( where tvtropes started , but they now do much more ) , it refers to archetypes and things that repeat in many places . For example , take some work of fiction that you know and google it with tvtropes . Like Lord of the Rings : URL_0 If you look through the pages of tropes it exemplifies , you 'll find this one : Attack of the 50 - Foot Whatever : The Mumakil , enormous elephant - like beasts . If you look at the trope 's page URL_1 you 'll see an explanation of what that trope is -- many works of fiction include gigantic versions of not - usually - so - large things , so much that it 's a trope ! It usually happens in a certain way , and it 's a common narrative resource . And that page will list works that use giant versions of things : Honey I Blew Up the Kid , for example , features a giant baby . King Kong has a giant ape , etc . If you look , a lot of the elements that make up any particular piece of media are common elements , used all over because they make for good storytelling in some way , or good gaming , or whatever .

This is all partially true , although it should be remembered that , like the Billionaire in your question , many of these people had good intentions . They really thought they were helping the natives out of poverty , savagery and paganism , and that it was not only the right but the duty of civilized white men to rule other races that could n't rule themselves . And if they made a fortune out of resources that the natives were hardly using , why not ? After all if the British did n't occupy these places [ someone else who was really nasty would instead . ] ( URL_0 ) This might all seem horribly racist but you are basically making the same assumption : that some rich guy from a rich country can run a country better than the natives . It 's not just you either . Despite all the condemnation of imperialism we continue to have the same debate all the time that they had in the 19th century .

If we tax(ed ) is properly , we would have less of a problem with our economy . If we let the super - wealthy just take their money and take it out of the economy , everyone suffers . Except them , initially . The problem with making this work is that most people do n't understand the insane amount of wealth that goes un - taxed , or under - taxed . Simply because the super - wealthy are so few , does not mean they are insignificant . They own more wealth than everyone else combined , many times over . The thing is , the amount of wealth they have is simply too large for most people to comprehend , therefore they do not understand how much it actually is , and how much of a difference it would make were it taxed properly . * * If we taxed that shit properly , nobody else with a reasonable amount of money would have to make any sacrifices whatsoever . * * Anyone who believes that \" we all have to pitch in \" is just naïve .

Now take this to a much bigger scale : Instead of mom + dad , it 's the entire United States . The United States taxes but it does n't collect enough to pay its programs and interest , so they borrow money from the world . The world here is n't just other countries ... its millions and millions of U.S. citizens who invest in money market funds ( money markets are many times made up of U.S. government debt ) , pension funds , social security funds , etc . It 's also other countries ' citizens that want a safe place to put their money . It 's also other governments ( like China ) that have lots and lot of dollars from all U.S. citizens buying their goods and they need a safe place to put it so they buy U.S government bonds .", "You 're probably under the relatively common misconception that governments loan money directly to each other . With this view , it would indeed not make any sense if every country were in debt . However , that 's not how government debt works . Instead , the government issues bonds that are purchased by anyone and everyone in the general public . In a sense , the general public loans money to the government . Anyone can buy a bond from the government , but the biggest holders are generally banks and other financial institutions ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 270.33333333333337}

But here's the best part: there are different kinds of RAID boxes, and each one is special in its own way! 😍\n\nLet me tell you about them:\n\n1. RAID 0: This is like a really fast, super-duper big box! It takes two or more hard drives and combines them into one super-fast storage drive. It's like a race car for your computer's data! 🚀\n2. RAID 1: This is a safety-first box! It takes two hard drives and mirrors all the data on one drive onto the other. It's like having a backup of your data, just in case something happens to the first drive. 🛡️\n3. RAID 5: This is a smarty-pants box! It takes multiple hard drives and combines them in a really smart way to make sure your data is safe and protected. It's like a magical box that keeps your data safe and sound! 🔮\n4.

Imagine that your hard drives are 3 - ring binders , and the different pieces of data that you want are printed on individual sheets within that binder . For this example , you need the information that 's on pages 5 - 10 of this binder , and a page takes a negligible amount of time to read . If a person gets sick , then their binder gets destroyed . * * Single Drive Setup * * One person has your binder . You say \" I want to know what 's on pages 5 - 10 \" . The person has to go to page 5 , read , turn the page , read again , turn the page , etc . until all information is read . * * Raid 0 * * You split your binder into multiple binders ( 5 for this example ) . The first binder contains pages 1 and 6 , while the second binder contains pages 2 and 7 , and so on . You pass the 5 binders to 5 different people and say \" I want to know what 's on pages 5 - 10 \" . Each person flips to their page that lies in that range , and prepares to read . You can get all of your information without any page turning ( except for the initial lag , or * access time * ) . If anyone gets sick , their information is lost and you can not get it back . * * Raid 1 * * You have two separate binders , each identical and containing pages 1 - 10 . You give them to two separate people so that if one of them gets sick and ca n't read , then the other one can read to you . Once the other person is replaced , their binder can be replaced with a copy . * * Raid 5 * * This is a little more complicated , and this example is a little different than reality . You split your binder up into 5 separate binders ( like in our raid 0 example ) , and then make copes of each one . Each of the 5 people have one binder of their own , and then a copy of one of the others . If nobody is sick , then each person reads from their own as requested . However , as long as only one person is sick at a time , the information they hold is still available , it just has to be read by a person who is already keeping track of their own binder . Once that sick person comes back , then the copy of their binder can be used to make them a new one so that they can read from it again . If two people are sick , however , then pages are missing , and can not be recovered . Everyone has to carry around 2 binders instead of one . * * Raid 10 , 0 + 1 , 01 * * You set up 5 people exactly like in the raid 0 example , and then set up another 5 the same way . As long as both people that carry a certain binder do n't get sick at once , all data is recoverable and can still be read efficiently . * * Writing * * The more binders you have , and the more split up the data , the harder and more time consuming it will be to add information .", "[ Not even two days ago ] ( URL_0 )", "[ I 'll just leave this here ] ( URL_0 )"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 252.66666666666666}

Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Let's talk about two big brain things: scientific laws and theories. Are you ready? 🤔\n\nA scientific law is like a superpower-level rule in the world of science. It's something that always happens, like gravity always pulling things down or the sun rising in the east. Scientists have seen it happen so many times, they know it's true and they can rely on it. It's like a recipe for how the world works! 📚\n\nA theory, on the other hand, is a really good idea that explains something big and important. It's like a puzzle pieces that fits together to make sense of the world. Scientists use theories to make educated guesses about how things work, and they can change them if they learn new stuff. It's like a game of guess-and-test, where scientists try to figure out the best explanation for something. 🤔\n\nHere's the best way I can explain the difference:\n\nThink of a law like a rule in a game. It's something that always happens, and you can rely on it. Like, if you jump up and down, you'll come back down to the ground! 🏋️‍♀️ That's a law!\n\nA theory is like a game board.

"answers": ["EDIT : Disregard , read reply thread for more clarification . I literally just asked my professor this in class because we were discussing the scientific method . A scientific theory is based on the scientific method ... observation , experimentation , essentially gathering a lot of evidence that supports your hypothesis and eliminates others as possibilities . We take theories as fact , but they 're not technically speaking laws . A scientific law is , according to my teacher , something which can be logically deduced and therefore irrefutable .", "It 's a little tricky to describe but this is my ( fairly basic - I 'm not a professional scientist ) understanding of it : A law is an \" explanation \" of a natural behavior , usually in the form of one or more mathematical equations . I put \" explanation \" in quotes because it does n't explain it in human terms . It does not answer the question \" why does this happen ? \" only provides the mathematical proof that it does and can be tested and reproduced using the formulas provided . A theory is the human term explanation , maybe more like a description . It explains why something happens and can describe its behavior in a way people can understand better than a math formula . This is part of why we have only laws for some things or only theories for others . There are some phenomena that exist that we have both theories and laws for , like gravity . There is both a theory of gravity and a law of gravity . The theory of gravity explains why things fall down when you throw them up and the law provides the mathematical formula for it . We can clearly see evolution happening and can describe its behavior with a lot of great detail , but we ca n't quite put it into formulaic terms ( the complexity associated in doing this hurts my brain ) . So there 's a theory of evolution , but not a law . Neither is more or less important than the other , neither is more or less correct , either . Hypothesis are what are arguable and go through rapid changes before we have a full understanding . Hypothesis are what potentially become theories and laws . Once something has become a theory or law , it 's as factually correct as scientists can verify it at that time . They typically only change once new information has been gathered , where they can then either be expanded upon or modified if inaccurate . I hope this explanation was helpful . The others in the thread seemed a little too complicated , this is about as simple as I can make it given my understanding . To professional scientists reading this post : please feel free to correct any inaccuracies here . I 'd rather be correct in my understanding than win any Internet arguments . :)", "There 's a lot of misconception out there about this . In science , a law is just a statement that 's always true . It 's usually empirical . For instance , when you 're doing Newtonian mechanics , with F = ma and all that , you deal with what are called \" force laws . \" It 's just a mathematical equation that says \" the force on a particle is such - and - such . \" A theory is a mathematical framework that relates laws to other laws . Both of those are distinct from a theorem , which in science means ( I think ) the same thing it means in math : It 's a statement which has been proven mathematically so it ca n't not be true ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 238.66666666666666}

Can you imagine! *gasp*\n\nOnce they're in the MAV, they'll blast off from Mars and travel through space until they're close enough to Earth. That's when things get really cool – they'll use something called a \"parachute\" to slow themselves down! *awesome face*\n\nIt's like a giant umbrella that opens in the sky and helps the MAV slow down really fast. The astronauts will be inside the MAV the whole time, nice and cozy, and when they touch down on Earth, they'll be home safe and sound! *cheers*\n\nNASA has been working on how to do this for a really long time, and they have some super smart engineers and scientists who are working on making it even better.

We do n't have the technology to lift something big enough to take people to Mars off the surface of the Earth in one piece , so it will have to be assembled in orbit . Once it has been built , something like NASA 's Orion would be fine for this part . 2 ) Earth orbit to Mars . A large spacecraft with a fuckton of fuel has to break Earth orbit and get on a trajectory to Mars . When it gets there , it has to decelerate and get into orbit around Mars . Again , this thing is wayyyyyy too big and heavy to land . Keeping spacecraft # 1 ( the Orion ) attached during this process would do nothing except waste fuel . 3 ) A Mars lander . This is a much smaller craft ( like Apollo 's Lunar Module ) that can land the crew and their supplies on Mars , and then when they 're done , lift off back to Mars orbit and rendezvous with the Big Ship . Then you do it all in reverse . The Big Ship fires rockets to get out of Mars orbit and on a path for Earth . When it gets there , it fires rockets again , and gets into a parking orbit of Earth . Then , another shuttle like # 1 comes up from Earth , they transfer to that , and return to Earth . The astute reader will notice the utter lack of an Orion capsule making it to Mars in this scenario . That 's because , no matter what the PR office at NASA claims , this craft is * completely * unsuitable for going to Mars in . Their claim is straight - up bullshit , and it 's distressing that nobody in the media is calling them out on it .", "By launching a rocket from Mars . That rocket might be part of the lander , like Apollo was , or a separately delivered vehicle . Most Mars missions envision multiple craft having to go to Mars to make the mission successful to a separately delivered craft is likely . The rocket will have to be landed on Mars but the fuel it uses to take off might be generated on Mars not brought from Earth . Most likely it will only go into Martian orbit , then dock with an orbiting craft and that craft return to Earth . A good place to start is the [ NASA Design Reference Mission ] ( URL_0 ) the Return Vehicle is on p 30 . This document has been superseded but its only about 7 years old ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 241.33333333333334}

That's why you'll usually hear music on FM radio stations and talk radio on AM stations. 🎵🗣️\n\nNow, you might be wondering, why is FM more popular than AM? 🤔 It's because FM radio waves can reach further distances than AM radio waves, like how a really good superhero can save the world from far away! 🌟 FM radio waves can reach way more places than AM radio waves can, because they can go through buildings and walls better. That means you can listen to your favorite music or talk show from anywhere in the city! 🎵🚀\n\n FM and AM, they're like two cool cousins that do different things! 😊 But they're both really important

Each radio station is broadcasting in its own \" section \" of the available radio spectrum ( or its own \" voice \" to use our analogy ) . As I 'm sure you learned in your science class , radio waves are , well ... waves ! If you graph them , they 're lines that go up , then down , up , then down . Each wave has slightly different characteristics . The frequency is how \" scrunched together \" the ups and downs are . Lines that go up and down very quickly over a short period are \" high frequency . \" Another characteristic is the amplitude - how high and low those ups and downs are . Lines that go waay up high and then waaay down low have a \" high amplitude \" The wave that 's being emitted from the tower is made to produce waves that are ONLY in that pattern ( this is called \" modulation \" ) . When your radio is receiving signals from the radio tower , it 's listening for a specific pattern based on either amplitude or frequency . It 's the same as tuning your ear to listen for your high squeaky friend vs the background - it 's just that radios are a LOT better at picking out one wave in a sea of waves . This is also why radio stations might get mad if you 're broadcasting your own waves in their spectrum . They paid to be able to broadcast at 87.4 - that 's THEIR territory . If you start broadcasting there also , then suddenly people are hearing both broadcasts at the same time - like having two squeaky friends shouting at you at the same time . As for why AM tends to have talk and FM tends to have music and the popularity differences , that 's a question for someone else to answer ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 260.66666666666663}

The wire in that person 's headphones just happen to pick up the frequency of a nearby radio station . Wires are covered in rubber ( which blocks the signal ) to stop this from happening , but apparently that 's not working in this case .", "Remember how in your middle / high school science class they taught you how if a wire gets close to a magnetic field it can induce a current ? Well ... guess what radio waves are ? They 're a magnetic field that fluctuates in reaction to a sound source , like say a microphone . A radio antenna is just a long thin wire that 's sensitive enough to get a current when the radio waves hit it . Your radio then amplifies that current and pumps it in to a speaker , and since it 's fluctuating the same way the original wave was , the speaker ends up making the same noises the microphone captures on the other end . You know what else has a long thin wire hooked up to an amplifier and some speakers ? Your headphones . Electrically speaking your headphones / speakers are extremely similar to a radio - the only differences is that a ) you have no apparatus for tuning the frequency and b ) the headphones are usually receiving a stronger signal that overpowers any radiowaves that get picked up ( ie , the computer or whatever that you have the headphones plugged in to ) . Every now and then you get lucky ( or unlucky ) and radio waves DO overpower the local signal for whatever reason , and that 's when you hear radio in your ears . Nicer headphones / speakers get around this by using proper shielding on their cables - basically a light foil that 's wrapped around inside the insulation and blocks any radio waves from hitting the actual wires . However , even with shielding a sufficiently strong signal might still get through . For example , if I accidentally leave my cell phone too closer to my speakers I 'll sometimes audibly hear my text messages go out .", "Speakers are essentially a loop of wire next to a magnet . running a current through the wire creates an electromagnet which is attracted to or repulsed by the magnet . Which is what makes the speaker move and create sound . A radio signal can be picked up by any wire , converting to electricity in the wire ( that is how an antenna works ) . So a radio signal , if strong enough , will create an electric current in the wire in the speaker , making a sound . That is why for example speakers makes a noise if you call someone on your mobile phone too close to a speaker . In the case of your link , that is a microphone , which is kind of a speaker in reverse . The thing is that the electric current generated in a normal microphone is really weak . So it 's amplified a lot in the computer for it to be heard . But as I explained , every wire is essentially an antenna , so the wire between your headset and computer will pick up radio signals . I 'm guessing the guy lives really close to the radio station if he can actually hear what it picks up and not just get noise . I had a similar problem when I got an extension cord for my microphone . It made it completely useless as the longer cord picked up a lot of static ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 235.33333333333334}

a group share a birthday . We call it the birthday paradox because as the group gets bigger , it becomes very likely surprisingly fast . The probability that any two people will share a birthday is only 1/365 , but in a group of 23 , there is a 50 % chance of a collision . When the group reaches 50 people , there is less than a 1 % chance that two people will * not * share a birthday . The odds grow so fast because each time you add a new person to the group , you have to check to see if his birthday matches any of the other birthdays in the group , and the more people you add , the more birthdays you have to check . In other words , the probability grows with the number of possible * pairs of people * rather than just the raw number of people in the group . Each possible pair is an additional 1/365 chance of a collision , and the number of possible pairs grows really fast . To help visualize why the pairs of people grow so quickly , check out [ this diagram ] ( URL_0 ) . Think of the red dots as people , and each line as a possible pairing , an extra chance for a collision . By the time you reach 23 people , there are hundreds of pairings , each one representing a 1/365 chance of a collision . [ When you look at it that way , it does n't seem like much of a pradox at all ] ( URL_1 ) .", "[ Diagram for referene ] ( URL_0 ) It all comes down to the fact that any day has an equal change at being someones birthday , right ? The trick is that YOUR birthday does nt have to match with someone elses , but that SOMEONE must match with someone elses , see the distinction ? In this case , you are matching pairs up , not individuals . At a group of 23 ( complicated math left out ) there is a 50 % chance that someone will share a birthday .", "Lets make this simpler : if you only had 1 person , then there is a 0 % chance that two people can share the same birthday right ? ( I know this is obvious , but the first thing you need to do is let go of the idea that the number of people equals the number of chances for having a match ) . now , two people means that there is one chance , because , there is only one pair to consider , but what happens if you have 3 people , lets call them Bob , John and Alice . Bob and John make one pair , Bob and Alice make another pair , and John and Alice make 3 pairs . By adding one person , our probabilities jumped from 1/365 to 3/365 . Lets add one more , now we have Bob , John , Alice and Sarah , lets count the pairs : Bob and John , Bob And Alice , Bob And Sarah , John and Alice , John and Sarah , and Alice and Sarah . So by adding one more person , the number of possible pairs that have a chance of sharing the same birthday , jumped from 3 in 365 to 6 in 365 . If this is still confusing , just try adding more and more people , you ll notice that every person has to be checked against every other person , not just individually ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 261.33333333333337}

They worked really hard every day to find enough food to survive, but they didn't have much left over to share or save. But then, some very special people had some great ideas! *excited clap*\n\nOne of these special people, let's call him John, realized that if he worked really hard and saved his food, he could trade it with other people for things he needed or wanted. Like, maybe he wanted a sharp stone arrowhead to hunt better, or a beautiful piece of shell jewelry to show off to his friends. So, John started trading his food and skills with other people, and pretty soon he had more stuff than anyone else in his group! *exaggerated nod*\n\nBut that's not all, little buddy! John didn't stop there. He saw that if he taught other people how to make and fix things, they could help him too.

Rousseau would say that the first wealthy man was the man who convinced others that he could ' own ' land . Prior to that , humanity lived in a state of noble savagery , where all men were afforded what their strength could win them . Marx would say that the first wealthy man was a soldier , who beat and enslaved a group of people to make the first poor people . The truth is probably somewhere in between all of these , or some other as yet unknown theory .", "Wealth in the sense you 're using it does n't really exist in a hunter - gatherer society . When you 're wandering around after herds of animals or to seasonal campsites , you can only carry so much with you . Everyone in the society spends almost all their time on basic survival ; gathering food and making shelter . There is little specialization , so the ability to produce items of exceptional quality is very limited . You might have one chief who is in charge or organizes things , but this is more authority than wealth . It may be based on group consensus , physical strength , or hunting ability , but there is no way to accumulate stuff so as to be able to \" hire \" people . Wealth started with agriculture . Suddenly , not everyone had to be employed in the procurement of food 24/7 . Also , people were stationary , so they could build solid houses and accumulate stuff . Specialization allowed individuals to become highly skilled at a particular job , and thus to produce items of significantly higher quality . It also allowed the development of technology such as metal working that produced items that had a high value . It was these people who were released from the need to devote themselves to basic survival that allowed for the development of a basic economy . Once that happened , people could accumulate wealth in the ways you typically would expect ( being the leader and taking stuff from others , being the best blacksmith and making great tools and weapons , being smart , etc . )", "The concept of accumulating wealth would n't have come around until there was a resource worth accumulating and there was enough of a surplus of it to accumulate . You would also need the concept of possession / ownership . I doubt a hunter - gatherer society would have that pre - requisite concept ( ie . everything would be shared or discarded if unnecessary ) . If we are talking about things like number of children or relative decision - making power within the community as criteria of wealth , than maybe that context works for prehistoric societies . In the most basic context , wealth may have equalled power . The more power you have , the more likely you are to get the best things as they were gathered / hunted / made . There would have been little to nothing to accumulate though , so wealth was as temporary as your power . Modern wealth would have sprung up around the time when people settled down and formed civilizations . If you stay in one place , build a permanent home , and have the means to provide food and water to your family , than you have the opportunity to accumulate things beyond those necessities ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 262.66666666666663}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow do we accurately place objects into different orbits ? How do we ensure there wo n't be collisions with the thousands of other objects orbiting the earth ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! 😊 Orbiting objects, like a satellite or a spaceship, around a big body like Earth, is a really cool thing to do. But, you're right, we have to make sure that the object doesn't collide with other things in orbit around Earth. Here's how we do that:\n\n1. We do some math: We use math to figure out where the object needs to be in its orbit so that it doesn't crash into anything. We look at things like how fast the object is going, how heavy it is, and how far away it needs to be from Earth.\n2. We use powerful rockets: When we launch a satellite into orbit, we use powerful rockets to give it a really good push up into the air. The rocket propels the satellite to a lot of speed, and then it goes into orbit around Earth.\n3. We track the object: We use special instruments on Earth to watch where the object is in its orbit. We can see where it's moving and how fast, and we can tell if it's getting too close to anything else in orbit.\n4. We give it a nudge: If the object starts to get too close to something else in orbit, we can give it a tiny nudge with a rocket to push it away. It's like giving a toy car", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Hey", "logprob": -0.7478387355804443}, {"text": "there", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0},

We know where pretty much every single shred of thing is there in space above the size of a screw , so we place stuff where they are needed and where they can go . Also ... Space is * huge * there is plenty of room up there .", "Turns out , there actually are agencies out there who manage all of this . The most notable being the US Navy . ( I think ? If someone could confirm that that would be great ) Most satellites are destined for geostationary orbit , which is by far the easiest place to manage space traffic . Due to the way geostationary orbit works , any satellite in that orbit will always be at the same height , going the same speed , and in the same direction . Ignoring small perturberances to a satellite 's orbit , you could theoretically line up satellites into a huge conga line that stretches around the Earth , and have it fly around forever without any satellites colliding . In a way , that 's kind of how it works . There is a line of satellites in geostationary orbit stretching around the Earth , filled with all of the gps satellites , all the satellite TV and radio satellites , communications satellites carrying internet traffic , etc , all separated by miles of space between each satellite of course . When someone wants to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit , they pick a spot in this giant conga line and register their choice with the US Navy , then they carefully fly their satellite into its slot in geostationary orbit . Of course , no orbital placement is perfect , and satellites might drift out of their slots , but when that happens , each satellite has on board propulsion systems that can move the satellite back into position . When the satellite is old and outdated , the satellite is usually moved into a higher orbit , called a graveyard orbit , where satellites go to die , and its spot in the conga line goes to another satellite . Other satellites that do n't go into geostationary orbit are usually much harder to control , however , they are watched religiously by workers on the ground . Before any satellite launches , simulations of the satellite 's orbit over its entire lifetime is run , to ensure that the planned orbit will not collide with any other satellites at the same altitude . If a satellite drifts out of its orbit at any time , controllers on the ground will always be there to steer it back into position . Typically when the lifetime for these low orbit satellites is over , they reenter the atmosphere and burn up , ensuring that it does n't become space junk .", "The radius of earth is roughly 6400 km . Add to it 200 km of atmosphere , and you end up putting 10 m² satellites on a 83000 km² surface . Plenty of space to launch rockets and other satellites . If you 're asking how do we put an object on orbit , it 's easy to understand : we calculate the gravitationnal force between what we want to launch and the object we want it to be on orbit on . Then , we launch the rocket in order for it to be tangent to a circle ( the orbit ) of center the object and of radius the one calculated using the force mentionned earlier . info : F = G*M1*M2 / D² and a Fundamental Law of Dynamics and it 's done ;)"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 247.66666666666666}

income inequality being harmful and heard a few arguments that I agree with and some I do n't but they are worth a conversation anyway . First off , lets just get it out of the way : There will always be rich people , this is n't a bad thing . Also , the income inequality that we have here is completely incomparable to the third world because our median standard of living is so much higher . It 's a silly argument not worth defending , but I hear it made often . What matters with that statistic are trends over time . The mere presence of extreme wealth alone does n't make you any worse off , but they way our economy works some its effects will overtime hurt the economy because of the way money is controlled . It 's not a zero sum game , but wealth introduction starts somewhere and the way classes handle it when they get it are different and it lends itself to the argument of inequality being a net bad when left unchecked . The following are all generalizations : Rich people save money , much much more than the average person . Yes , they live comparably extravagant lives , but what they are spending is often a smaller percentage of their income than what a middle class person spends . Middle class , I just lump them all in here , are people that save a little but overall spend most of their salary . They buy houses , luxury items , they really spend and it 's healthy for the economy when they do this . Poor people , they do n't make a lot of money and spend it all , but entirely on necessities and not a lot of discretionary spending . Income inequality tends to remove buying power from the middle classes , turning them lower , and gives that money to the rich who will tend to save it . Saving is actually a bad thing for the economy when done in excess , this is contrary to what we are taught as individuals . The economy is based on spending , that s what the downturn we experienced can be generalised as , a lack of spending , self reinforced . The rich are n't completely useless , they are sometimes savvy investors , business owners and people who make some important parts of the economy happen , without their capital there would be nothing . But the spending of the middle classes is the most fickle and necessary part of a healthy economy so diminishing that has consequences .", "They hoard resources . The use these resources to influence government away from pursuing a common good . The control pricing and wages and ensure you pay the highest prices and receive the lowest wages .", "Do you pay rent for your housing ? Do you have trouble finding a job ? Do you fear you might not have enough money to retire at a reasonable age ? Do you find your wallet constrained by the prices of everyday goods ? If not , congratulations , you 're already on top . But billions of people do face some or all of these problems . And one of the main reasons they do is as a consequence of the socioeconomic elite manipulating economies and governments in order to augment their own wealth and power ( which in turn is what they use for said manipulation ) . The problem is n't that they 're rich per se , the problem is that they use unfair techniques to * stay * rich ( and get richer ) at the expense of society ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 256.33333333333337}

Osmosis is a really cool process that happens in your body and in plants! 😊\n\nOsmosis is like when you have a bunch of water balloons in a room, and you want to make sure they're all the same size. But, sometimes, the water inside some of the balloons might be a tiny bit more, or a tiny bit less, than the other balloons. So, what do you do? 🤔\n\nYou know how you can make the water inside the balloons equal by sharing it around? That's kind of like what happens in osmosis! 🎨\n\nIn your body, tiny tiny tiny things called cells are like the water balloons. They have a special job to do, and they need to stay nice and healthy to do that job. Sometimes, though, the cells can get a bit stretchy, like they've been blown up too much! 😳\n\nThat's where osmosis comes in! It's like a special helper that brings more water inside the cell to make it go back to being just the right size. It's like sharing the water balloons around, so that every cell has the right amount of water it needs. 😊\n\nAnd in plants, osmosis is a little", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0},

what a solute is and what a solvent is . A solvent is usually what there 's more of . It 's what you start out with . The solute is what you put in the solvent . For example , if you had water and food dye , and you wanted to make orange water ( do n't ask me why ) , water would be your solvent and the orange dye would be your solute - because you put the dye in the water , not vice versa . A mixture of solute and solvent is known as a solution . Now let 's talk about concentration . For something to be ' concentrated ' simply means that there is relatively more solute in the solvent than there is in some other solution . So say I put 5 drops of orange dye in a litre of water and call it Beaker 1 . And then I put 20 drops of orange dye in another litre of water , and call it Beaker 2 . Beaker 2 is more concentrated than beaker one , because there is more solute ( dye ) dissolved in the same amount of solvent ( water ) . Onto osmosis , using a real life example . So a plant is chillin ' in the ground . The plant is using the awesomeness that is photosynthesis to make a bunch of sugar . In the stem of this plant , there 's a ton of sugar ( solute ) and not a lot of water ( solvent - FYI water is always a solvent ) . In the earth / soil that the plant 's roots are chillin ' in , the opposite is true - not a lot of plant sugars , but there is a lot of water . So the stem is much more concentrated than the earth . Osmosis seeks to maintain an EQUILIBRIUM - equal amount of solvent and solute on either side of the membrane . The membrane is simply what separates the two regions of differing concentrations , and here it is the outside layer ( cell wall ) of the plant . So , in order to achieve this equilibrium , the water in the earth moves past the membrane into the plant stem , so as to dilute the solute ( sugars ) in the stem . Thus , with this addition of water , the inside of the stem is no longer more concentrated than the earth outside of it . Make sense ? * * tl;dr * * solvent ( usually water or whatever there is more of ) moves from a place where there 's a lot of it , to a place where there is n't a lot of it .", "Osmosis and Diffusion are over simplified in most text books . This is great if you 're actually 5 . But if you 're interested in knowing * why * osmosis occurs , why things try to maintain an equilibrium of solvent and solute watch [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . I 'm going to go out on a limb and say Khan is the best teacher on the web . You can spend a few hours with him and learn more then you did in all of high school . It 's fairly amazing .", "Thank you both . I have a much better understanding of how that works now . As Everywhereasign said , now I just need to learn the \" why \" to it all . My question came as I have been seeing a lot about trying to solve the worlds water problem through reverse osmosis ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 246.33333333333334}

Edit : Thanks guys . Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Oh, wow! You're asking about chemicals! *nerd alert* Well, you know how there are different kinds of sugars like glucose and fructose? Yeah, these alcohols are kind of like sugars too, but they're in a special class all their own. Are you ready to learn about them? 🤩\n\nIsopropyl alcohol, also called rubbing alcohol, is like a superhero because it can be used to clean germy surfaces and make you feel all better when you're feeling sick. It's like a magic potion! *cues theme music* Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is what makes your favorite alcoholic drinks taste yummy. It's like a party in your mouth! 🎉 And methyl alcohol, or methanol, is a bit more tricky. It's like a ninja warrior because it can be used to make stuff like adhesives and cleaning products, but you have to be really careful with it because it can be bad for you if you don't use it right. It's like a double-edged sword! 🕹️\n\nSo, the biggest difference between these alcohols is what they're good at.

It is produced by yeast . . The yeast eat some kind of sugar or starch and turn it into carbon dioxide and alcohol . In wine the process is pretty simple – yeast eats the sugar in grape juice and creates alcohol . In whiskey , the alcohol is distilled to get the concentration higher . Ethanol that you purchase as a car fuel is the same kind of alcohol found in whiskey , but it has been distilled to the point where it is nearly pure alcohol ( as opposed to whiskey which is typically only 40 % alcohol and 60 % water ) . Methanol is sometimes found in windshield wiper fluid to keep it from freezing , and it is also used as the fuel for Champ cars and Indy cars . It is sometimes called wood alcohol because it used to be made from wood , but today its made from natural gas . Methanol is poisonous , and it is one of the chemicals that can be used to poison denatured alcohol . The chemical difference is how many carbon atoms there are .", "They 're different chemicals . An alcohol is a string of carbon atoms that are bonded to hydrogen atoms everywhere except that there 's an ( OH ) in place of a hydrogen atom somewhere . Methanol is the simplest alcohol , consisting of just one carbon atom , 3 hydrogen atoms , and one ( OH ) group . Ethanol is basically the same as methanol , except it has two carbon atoms . Isopropyl alcohol has three carbons , but it 's a little different from methanol and ethanol . Instead of having the ( OH ) group at one end of the molecule , it has it sticking out of the middle . In terms of effects on the human body , they all do similar things . The problem with drinking methanol and isopropanol is that the stuff your body metabolizes them into is quite toxic and can cause a lot of bad stuff to happen . Fortunately , one way to treat overdoses of methanol and isopropanol by getting the person very drunk for a while . Your body prefers to metabolize ethanol over methanol and isopropanol , so staying drunk for a while allows you to get rid of the methanol or isopropanol by breathing , sweating , and urinating it out directly without being turned into bad stuff .", "Methyl alcohol has one Carbon atom and one hydroxyl group ( -OH ) . Its chemical formula is CH3 - OH . It is aka \" wood alcohol \" as at one time it was obtained by wood distillation . It is poisonous to drink . It will give the similar mind - altering effects as ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) , but it will eventually make you go blind . Ethyl alcohol has 2 carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group . Its chemical fomula is C2H5OH ( or CH3 - CH2 - OH ) . It is frequently obtained by the yeast - driven distillation of grains and fruits . It has mind altering effects , but can lead to other medical problems if use is frequent and chronic . It is also often used as a fuel additive . Isopropyl alcohol has 3 carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group , with the hydroxyl group attached to the middle carbon atom . Its chemical formula is C3H7OH ( or CH3 - CH(OH)-CH3 ) . It is poisonous to drink . It is used almost exclusively as an industrial solvent or as a medical disinfectant .

It 's sold on amazon , and its cheap . It 's not patented . And it kills bacteria ... BEFORE we had antibiotics , infections were treated with sulfa drugs , up through the Korean war . Sulphur - based drugs are still used for people who ca n't take antibiotics or in containing antibiotic - resistant bacterias . Mix 1 teaspoon of sulphur powder with 1 cup of rubbing alcohol in a glass or plastic container . ( sulphur wo n't dissolve in water , but it suspends in rubbing alcohol . ) Shake well . Twice a day , AFTER you have washed your face , shake up your sulphur solution and saturate a cotton ball with it . Using -firm- strokes , stroke the solution over your face . Make your strokes firm to help dig the bacteria out of your pores and get the sulphur into your pores . Leave it on . When it dries , if you have a little visible yellow dust , just brush it off with your fingertips . Bacteria * can not live * in the presence of sulphur . As long as you have a light coating of sulphur on your face ( light enough it ca n't be seen ) , bacteria will not be able to survive on your face or in your pores and since its not there , it will not multiply into infections . And the infections are zits . Therefore , no zits . This wo n't make acne treatment companies any money . There is no patent on sulphur , its a common mineral . But it solves the problem .

After years of fucking around with bullshit internet \" cures \" I took a weeks supply of minocycline that my derm gave me and followed with accutane . Two months into the treatment and the acne covering 75 % of my face was 100 % gone forever ( I finished the 6 month course of accutane even though I was 100 % clear 1/3 of the way through ) Accutane is a miracle drug and the only real cure to acne .

He used a special technique with oils to create thin glazes of color . Her face insinuates an emotion , like there is something going on off the canvas . This was one of the first well - known representations in Western art that acquires the sense of self . Art was very often used religiously so previous painters like Fra Filippo Lippi and Ghiberti were known for painting religious images . Though it is believed to be a rich person : Lisa Del Giocondo , it is not a god or someone in worship . The sense of self and humanity is what makes this painting famous . It involves no Greek gods or anything involving the Cult of Christ like his predecessors .", "Sam & Bob are neighbors . One day Sam carves a figurine out of a branch from the fallen tree in his yard . Bob admires the figurine , and offers to purchase it from Sam . Sam agrees since he could use the money . Bob brags about the figurine 's quality to his friends , who ask to see it . Bob shows it to them , and not wanting to seem rude or like they know nothing about figurines , they agree with Bob and praise him for buying it . Now one of Bob 's friends * also * wants to be praised & seem very knowledgeable about figurines , so he offers to buy it from Bob , but Bob says he is very fond of it . Bob 's friend then offers to pay a lot of money for the figurine . Thinking of all the things he could buy with that money , Bob decides to sell it to him . The figurine is now * considered * valuable , and Bob 's friend shows it to many other people , all the while praising it 's quality & value . Over many years , the figurine is bought & sold many times . Each owner pays more than the owner before him did , and each owner adds reasons that the figurine is of high quality & high value . One day , the figurine is stolen . The owner publicizes the theft of his high - quality , high - value figurine , and everyone who hears about it comes to believe that it * must * be of high quality & value . The thief takes the figurine to a wealthy man who has heard of the figurine and greatly desires to have such a high - quality , high - value item . He pays the thief a lot of money , and then hides it away where only he can admire it . When the wealthy man dies , his family discovers the figurine and publicizes it . Since the last official owner died long ago , they sell it to someone else for a lot of money , which is also publicized . And so the process continues , and is fed by people who buy items considered to be high quality / value so that they may obtain the admiration of others , even if the item is little more than a piece of wood from a fallen tree carved by a guy named Sam .", "I guess because Da Vinci painted it , and very little is known about it .

Like Broadway in London or Oxford Street in Manchester. Well, in the US, they do the same thing, but they have some special ways of naming them! 🚗\n\nHere's the deal: whenever they build a new street, they choose a name that's easy for people to remember and pronounce. They also try to be creative with the names, so they're fun to say! 😜\n\nFor example, \"Raven\" is a really cool name for a street, don't you think? It's like a magical bird that flies around at night, singing mysterious songs! 🦁 And \"42nd\" is a great name because it's a really big number, like a superhero's number or something! 💪\n\nAs for

The examples you mentioned \" [ street x ] and [ street y ] \" are cross streets . They are saying \" at the intersection of Raven and 42nd \" . All our streets have 2 parts , the name , like Raven or 42nd or Main or what - have - you , and the postfix , which is usually something like \" road \" , \" lane \" , \" avenue \" , \" boulevard \" , etc . I 've seen some like Circle , Loop , Way , etc etc . Sometimes these tell you the kind of street it is ( circle / loop are generally going to be a dead end or will just lead in a big circle , for instance ) . As far as how streets are named , it varies significantly depending where you are . Housing developments like to have \" themes \" , so all the streets in the area will be named after nautical terms , or types of trees / flowers , or people 's names , crap like that . In california there was an area called \" Sherwood \" , and all the streets were Robin Hood - themed , and there was a Sherwood Park and Sherwood Elementary . It was totally awesome , there . My mom 's house is in an area with really weird first names , like \" Alecandro Daniel Avenue \" or \" Robin Persey Lane \" and other ridiculous shit . Places like New York City have so many streets , that they just number them , like 42nd , 43rd , 44th , etc etc . In NYC I believe they get higher the further \" uptown \" you go , so based on the number you can tell whether it 's in the ghetto or a nice area . Finally , an address is constructed like so : [ Number ] [ Prefix ] [ Name ] [ Postfix ] [ Unit ] Prefix is not required ( which would be North , South , etc ) , number is required ( that 's the actual address ) , name is required obviously , and postfix is n't strictly necessary but it 's often used as part of the address . Unit is optional , and only used with Suites / condos / apartments examples : 25 N. Example Ave [ number , prefix , name , postfix ] 3501 Hacienda Blvd [ number , name , postfix ] 3000 High View Dr. # 901 [ number , name , postfix , unit ] 8670 S. Eastern Ave [ number , prefix , name , postfix ] 1500 E. Tropicana Ave Ste 395 [ number , prefix , name , postfix , unit ] Make sense ?", "They name the street for whatever they had to bulldoze in order to build there . Oak Street , Cypress Road , Forest Glen Lane , and so forth .", "It depends a lot on the city . Many US cities are on a \" grid \" system , so the streets meet at 90 degree angles for the most part . Several towns use that to their advantage in naming streets . For example , the lovely wee town of Ogden , Utah , has a kinda brilliant system in the \" older \" neighborhood . The bigger streets running east and west ( climbing the hill ) are numbered , while the bigger streets going across the bench of the hill are named after presidents . It makes navigation pretty dang easy . And a LOT of other towns do that , too ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 251.66666666666666}

Let me tell you a magical story about how the system of nobility and peasanthood came to be! 🧝🏻\n\nA long, long time ago, in the medieval times, people lived in small villages and towns. They worked together to grow food and take care of each other. But, some families were born into special houses with big fancy titles like \"Lord\" or \"Lady.\" These families were called \"nobility.\" 🏰\n\nTo become a noble family, you had to be born into it! 🤔 It was kind of like being born with a golden egg in your hand. Your family had to be really rich and powerful to be a noble. They had more land and power than the other families in the village. 🏠\n\nNoble families had lots of powers and responsibilities! They got to make decisions for the whole village and protect everyone from bad people and animals. They also got to have fancy parties and invite all their friends! 🎉🏼\n\nBut, being a noble wasn't all fun and games! They also had to do lots of work to keep their land and power. They had to make sure everyone was safe and happy, and they had to protect their land from other people who might want to take it.

It arose in many , many places and even in the same places many times again and again over history . There 's no one answer other than something general like : \" The guy with the most weapons and folks to hold them said it 'd be like that . \" The isle of Great Britain alone has had more kingdoms on it than you could shake a stick at in the past 1500 years , never - mind Europe generally or the whole world . > How did a family establish itself as ' noble ? ' Depends on the realm in question . In some cases the nobility was just about as good as locked down - it was basically never the case that a commoner could become a landowner or holder of titles . In some realms a noble might grant nobility to some degree or another for military accomplishments , or simply because they liked that person . > What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Again , varies realm to realm . A duke , count or whatever might be charged with defending the realm from the other kingdom that bordered their lands . Some were charged with meeting quotas for food harvested or for providing soldiers . Some held the power to , along with the other gentry , select the king or depose him . Some realms had - at least on paper - royal families for all time that could never be deposed or overruled . There have been kingdoms , empires and other realms beyond counting in history , and no two exactly the same .", "The vast majority of the people were peasants- people who farmed to feed themselves . As for the nobles , I suspect that in many cases they would 've been conquering invaders whose descendants remained a specialized noble / warrior class . In the period of instability that followed the fall of the Roman Empire , there were opportunities for barbarians to attack peasants , or for groups of warriors to get peasants to give them tribute in return for protection . Then you have a knightly or warrior caste emerging . The Normans are an example . They were Viking invaders who raided France . Then the French king gave some of the Vikings land in return for helping to defend France against other Viking raiders . So the Viking Normans became French nobles . Later on the Normans invaded England from France and defeated the Anglo - Saxons . Then the Normans became the new nobles of England , replacing the older Anglo - Saxon nobility , while the majority of the Anglo - Saxons were still peasants .", "Charlemagne basically invented the Feudal system as we know it . He and his tribe were a bunch of badasses , who conquered a lot of land . He wanted to keep control of this land , so he put some of his warriors in charge of the lands . They built forts , collected regular tribute from the locals , and so forth . Over time , other places in Europe copied Charlemagne 's system of oaths of fealty and family lands . More interestingly , this system is * entirely * European . Other cultures created nobility in very different ways . In the Islamic world , for example , nobility was simply a matter of wealth - you owned a lot , and were expected to keep an army to defend what you own . I hope others can tell you more about the Nobility in India , East Asia , and Central America ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 252.33333333333334}

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* You know how we have different foods that we eat, like chicken, beef, and pork? Well, fish is a little different because it's actually already a kind of meat! *excited nod*\n\nThat's right, fish is meat that comes from the ocean. It's like a special kind of plant that grows in the water instead of on land. And just like how we eat plants, like vegetables and fruit, we can also eat fish because it's food for people. Yay! *fist pump*\n\nBut the thing is, not all meat is good to eat raw. Like chicken, beef, and pork, they have to be cooked to make them safe to eat. That's because they come from land animals, and their insides can have some yucky stuff in them, like bacteria and germs. Ooh, gross! *shudder*\n\nBut fish, being ocean meat, doesn't have to worry about those yucky things because they live in the water where it's all clean and stuff. So, it's totally okay to eat fish raw, like sushi or sashimi. It's like a special little treat for your tummy! *grin*\n\nI hope that makes sense, my friend.

["Contrary to what many people are saying guns in the Civil War were way , way more accurate than the guns your average solders was using 20 years before the civil war . The problem was that they were still using black powder . Because of the range and power of [ rifled muskets ] ( URL_1 ) meant that the first couple of volleys could be catastrophic for the guys on the receiving end but soon after that there was so much smoke on the battle field that it would be hard to even see the enemy until they were very close . That being said , [ Napoleonic tactics ] ( URL_0 ) where much more common in the beginning stages of the Civil War than they were towards the end . Early forms of trench warfare were widely used during the later parts of the war although attackers where not as vulnerable as they were during WWI .", "So , let 's say you are a commander in pre - rifle infantry combat . Your muskets are not very accurate , so you need to mass troops together for effective volleys against the enemy . Further , any officer might be in charge of over one hundred individuals . You do n't have radios , the only thing you have are flags and bugles . So to maintain control of your troops you had them march in big blocks of men . That way you could control them and gain maximum volley potential . When the Civil War hit gun technology outstripped tactics . It also outstripped communications technology . So really the only way to fight was to keep your men close to you in big blocks so you could maneuver them the only way you knew how . This of course led to massive causualties because the rifled guns were very accurate . This is why the Civil War was so deadly , the individual soldiers were trained to only march in big blocks , and the officers were only trained to command big blocks of troops . You even saw this into WW1 . When troops went \" over the top \" they marched in big lines of troops to ensure that their officers could retain control . This of course led to big lines of men being cut down by new machine gun technology . Once again gun technology outstripped tactics . It is only into WW2 that we see the modern idea of small unit tactics taking real hold . Now we had radios , now we had training that empowered lower raking enlisted to make their own decisions on the battlefield . To answer your question : The reason they marched like this is because there really was no other way , there was no way for commanders to give orders to individuals or small units , they could only effectively command large groups . This lack of communication technology had the huge side - effect of a lot , and I mean a lot , of Americans dying , but it was the only way that anyone knew to command , and really , it was the only way to command at all .", "The weapons of the time were not that accurate and took a while to reload , so the best way to deal damage was to mass a bunch of guys together and all fire at once . This way you were guaranteed to hit something . Yes it hindsight it seems incredibly dumb , but battles were fought according to attrition back then rather than by maneuver . Training , discipline , and sheer numbers were how you won back then ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 247.66666666666666}

was only one church back then , the Catholic Church ) forbade Christians from usury ( loaning people money and getting a return through charging interest ) . Thus many Jewish people rose to positions of influence in the economy and politically because they could lend merchants and lords money in order to trade and fight wars respectively . This has been a cause of resentment for centuries and it was and has been used by individuals as a means to build up antipathy against Jews . That is the historical origin of much of the animosity against the Jewish people in the West , however there has been discrimination against them for a very long time .", "In Medieval Europe , Jews were restricted from various activities like owning land , which forced them from agrarian / farming / serf type jobs into cities and towns with jobs that would today be considered \" white collar . \" Additionally , the church prevented christians from loaning money with interest ( usury ) , so Jews were left the very profitable banking industry . A great example would be the Rothschilds , a European banking family , widely considered to be one of the richest families ever . For a more in depth look explanation , go here - URL_0", "The historical reasons that the people have mentioned are very true , but they are not the only reason . Jewish culture is very strong , even across continents people have things in common , and years of discrimination have caused Jews to band together and make themselves useful . This is both the very issue that leads to so much discrimination , and the issue that keeps many Jews safe ; by making themselves essential to a community , they ensure that they can not be gotten rid of , but they will also garner a lot of resentment . So it 's kind of double - edged . More recently , Jewish culture is also very supportive of itself , establishing organizations all around the world in order to help other Jews . The culture puts a lot of emphasis on scholarly pursuit / education ( which is why there are so many Jewish philosophers ) , and shared values between Jews also means that Jews are more likely to view each other as family , and thus help each other out . This provides an effective safety net for Jews who want to ' rise to the top ' . As for Hollywood and comedy stereotypes , which are kind of true to an extent ( just check out the statistics of how much of those industries are Jewish ) , it has been shown in the past that people deal with difficult histories and events through humor , and so humor is a very strong part of Jewish culture as well . Another historical point : The Protocols of the Elders of Ziyon is a forged account of top Jewish leaders taking minutes of meetings planning how best to take over the world , it was naturally fabricated in order to villainize the Jews and is taken seriously by many people all over the world . I have had it quoted at me . I 'm not sure who wrote it , I believe it was written in Russia , but it was widely publicized by the Nazis and even Henry Ford . The publication did not say anything that people had n't been thinking for many years , and so it was n't actually very original , but it was very influential ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 263.0}

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nWhy does mixing colors of paint work differently than mixing colors of light ? Blue paint mixed with yellow paint will make green paint , but blue light mixed with yellow light will make white light . How is this possible ? ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Let me explain why mixing colors of paint works differently than mixing colors of light in a way that's easy to understand! 😊\n\nYou know how we have colors like blue, yellow, and green in paint? Well, when you mix blue paint with yellow paint, you create green paint! That's because the blue and yellow paint molecules are combining to make something new and different. They're mixing their properties to make green paint that has a blueish-yellowish color.\n\nBut, you know what? When you mix blue light with yellow light, you don't make green light! Instead, you make white light! 🤔 Why?\n\nIt's because light is a different thing than paint. Paint is a kind of material that has special molecules in it that reflect light in different ways. But light itself is a different thing entirely! When you mix light, like blue light and yellow light, they don't create something new and different like they do with paint. They just combine to make white light because they're both different kinds of light, you know?\n\nThink of it like a party with two different kinds of guests. If you mix blue guests with yellow guests, they'll create something new and interesting, like green guests! 😆 But if you mix blue light with yellow light, they're still just", "completions_tokens":

"answers": ["With paint , you 're mixing the opposite of light . Mixing paint is combining which colors are absorbed , and thus unseen , while mixing light is combining which colors are seen .", "Lamps emits and paint reflects . Let 's assume 3 colours : red , blue and yellow . When I have a white lamp , red , blue and yellow are emitted . When I have white paint red , blue and yellow are reflected . Now here is where it gets different . When I take 2 lamps of different colours and point then at the same spot , the colours get added . So let 's say you get red and blue lamps . Turn then on and you get all the red colours and all the blue colours resulting in a nice purple colour . But now we take paint . When you shine white light shining on red paint , the reflection throws away all other colours , but red . The same with blue paint throwing away everything but blue . So we got our paint and we 're ready to mix red and blue . The red paint wants to throw away the blue colour and the blue wants to throw away the red . Problem ? A bit . There are many shades of red and blue , and some of those shades are a bit alike . A blue - ish red and a red - ish blue are the shades that can still reflect . So our paint mix reflects a blue - ish red / red - ish blue light , but why is it darker , brown - ish and not pretty purple ? Well , we threw away a lot of shades of red and blue leaving not a lot of light to reflect of the paint to reach your eyes . TL;DR Lights add shades of colours to create a new colour spanning a broad colour spectrum . Paint subtracts shades leaving a narrow colour spectrum .", "When colors mix , what you 're really seeing is what wavelengths ( colors ) of light are hitting your eye . If they all hit your eye , you see white . or you could get just a red wavelength , or just a blue , or just a green . If you see no light , you see black Paint absorbs light . So if you shine a white light on white paint , it absorbs nothing and sends all the light to your eyes , so you see every wavelength and see white . If you Shine a white light on black paint , the black paint absorbs all the colors , so you get no light in your eye . If you shine a while light on green paint , it absorbs everything but green light , so your eye sees green light . Now the complex part is when you combine them . When you combine lights , your eyes are getting more and more light , so you 're getting closer to white . But when you combine paints and then shine white light on them , the more paint you combine means the more light is absorbed by the paint , so the less light actually reaches your eye , so you get closer to black . Basically , when dealing with lights you 're dealing with what colors actually reach your eye . When dealing with paints , you 're dealing with what colors DONT reach your eye , so to figure out what DOES reach your eye , you do the opposite .

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* So, you want to know why banks can't just create money out of thin air in their accounts? *chuckles* Well, the thing is, they can, but there are some very important reasons why they can't do that. Here's why:\n\nYou see, money is like a special kind of computer program that exists in the world, just like how your favorite video games or apps do. But instead of making you happy, money makes things like buying things or paying bills possible! *exaggerated smile* And just like how you need to have the right code to play your favorite game, money has rules that banks need to follow. These rules are like a kind of \"code\" that says how much money banks can make, and how they can use it.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"But if banks can just create money in their accounts, why do they need all that money in their vaults?\" *giggles* That's a great question! *adjusts glasses* You see, even though banks can create money in their accounts, they still need to have some money in their vaults to make sure that they can give it to people when they want to.

It 's hard to actually profit from doing it , regulations make it difficult to hide , and anyone who got caught doing it would go to jail .", "in terms of just changing the numbers , the only thing that stops that is the federal reserve and to a lesser extent regulators who audit those banks . if a bank is making it 's own money it 's defrauding the federal reserve ... who does n't really like them doing that . however there is one way a bank can create money : fractional reserve . say i own a bank , you put $ 100 in my bank i take that money and invest $ 60 of it ( think it 's 40 % they need to keep in ) as a loan to someone who needs a loan . i have $ 100 in your account , but i am also owed $ 60 from the guy i loaned your money to ( the money i say is in your account is still considered money AND the loan is considered money , and when he pays me back i made profit on the interest ) in this way a private bank can CREATE money . now some complexity happens if you ask for your $ 100 back before the loan is paid back , if that happens i give you your $ 40 plus $ 60 from someone else 's account . if everyone makes a run on the bank at once there is a problem , and to keep from needing to call in a bunch of loans or limit people 's ability to withdraw money , banks have to keep a certain amount of insurance to cover bank runs , and if need be can borrow from the federal reserve to prevent failure ( in the 1930 's this was a problem , banks had out a bunch of loans , people made a run on some banks , the banks could n't pay back , the back failed and a lot of people lost all their money , this caused more people to run and withdraw their cash so they do n't lose it causing a chain reaction of bank runs and bank failures , one of the catalysts for the great depression )"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 262.66666666666663}

Let's talk about something really important called the \"Categorical Imperative.\"\n\nSo, you know how there are rules in life that are just plain right, like \"Do not hit others\" or \"Do not take things without permission\"? Well, Kant thought that there were some super-extra-special rules like that, called moral laws, that are always and everywhere right.\n\nThese moral laws, like \"Do not lie,\" are like special principles that help us know what is always and everywhere right, no matter what. They're like special little guiding lights that help us make good choices and do the right thing, even when no one is watching.\n\nNow, just like how you might not always want to eat broccoli, sometimes people might want to do things that are not right, like lie. But Kant thought that even when it's hard, or when we might want to do something wrong, we should still try to do the right thing, because that's what the moral law says.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Kant doesn't mean that lying is always and everywhere immoral. What he means is that it's important to always try to do the right thing, even when it's hard, and to never forget that there are special moral laws that help us know what that is.\n\nThink of it like

They may have more players on their team than the other teams, but they're not always the best at fighting. See, the other teams, like the Elves and the Dwarves, they're like really good football players too. They're really good at fighting and they work together as a team. That's why they always win. It's like they have a secret playbook that they never show anyone. *grins mischievously*\n\nBut the Orcs, they're a bit like a football team with a coach who never knows the playbook. They're all over the place, and they never seem to work together. They're always fighting among themselves, or they're fighting the other teams without a plan. It's like they're running around in circles, while the other teams are marching towards victory. *chuckles*\n\nSo, that's why the Orcs lose most of the time.

of the Rings ( Arda ) , and of his creations , which included the Valar ( beings of great power who basically run things from afar ) and the Maiar ( beings of slightly lesser power , including the istari ( wizards ) like Gandalf and Sauron ) , and the elves , the elves were Iluvatar 's favorites . So , one of the Valar , a bad guy named Morgoth , captured some elves and tried to use them to create his own \" children \" - but they were a perversion of the elves , lesser in every way . These \" children \" are the orcs that continue to live on well after Morgoth 's departure from the world . Sauron and Saruman continue to use them as armies . These orcs live in the darkest places of earth , like Moria , and some of them could n't stand being out in daylight ( though Saruman bred some that could handle it ) . The reason they lose all the time is because ( 1 ) they initially did n't do too well in the sun , ( 2 ) they 're not as smart as elves because they 're a cheap copy , ( 3 ) they do n't have love or any other driving force to help motivate them to really TRY to win , and finally , because it is suggested in Tolkien 's works that when it counts , * when it really counts * , the Valar and Maiar kind of step in and help out a little bit . Gandalf , for example , lends great power and wisdom to the armies of elves and men throughout the War of the Rings , and some of the goodness and power of the valar still run through the earth and water of Arda . It 's some supernatural shit . ( Edit : for example , this is partially why the ringwraiths ( black riders ) are so hesitant to chase after Frodo when Arwen / Glorfindel carries him across the Bruinen , they do n't want to go into the water , because the spirit of the Vala , Ulmo , still resides in some of the waters of Middle Earth ) . Anyway , it 's been over 10 years since I was a real Tolkien scholar , but that sums it up pretty much in ELI5 terms , as far as I remember . Someone else might be able to provide a more accurate or detailed answer . Sources : The Silmarillion , the Unfinished Tales , Letters of Tolkien , LotR appendices . Edit : Someone else pointed out that they are n't as well trained , and this is probably part of it for sure . The men of Gondor and many different races of elves were well trained as warriors ( especially because elves , who are immortal , had lived through previous dark periods prior to the War of the Rings ) , so they would have the tactical advantage in some ways . Edit : details and examples Edit : This is literally the only time I 've ever felt I could contribute a useful answer in ELI5 .

Reddit does not work like most sites . The \" pages \" you go to are n't really pages . For reddits sorting to work , it has to keep all posts sorted . However , having all posts loaded and sorted would take forever to load and would just be bad website design . In fact it 's not possible . So reddit will paginate it . The way reddit does it , is every time you press next or go to the next page , it takes the i d of the last post you saw , and tells the system \" here is the last post I saw , please calculate the next 25 \" And so that 's what reddit does . It takes the last post you did see , then finds the next 25 ( or whatever your settings are ) The upside of this system is that : 1 . Content is dynamically generated - meaning if you go to page 1 , and in the time it takes you to go to page two , something was posted and got 1000 upvotes right away , you will see it on the next page load 2 . Reddit becomes paginated and easier to load and use . --- However there are downsides too , and these are both explained by the sorting algorithm . Reddits hot system is a mathematical algorithm . It uses votes and time and all sorts of little things . However , it 's not perfect . It 's just a formula that tries to calculate things . The downsides are 1 . Duplicates - it 's common and possible to go to page 2 and see some posts you saw on page 1 2 . \" Running out of reddit \" - this happens as well , when the mathematical algorithm ca n't find anymore posts . Since something is displayed as \" give me the sorted posts after X \" if X does n't have 25 posts that are sorted , it will error out . The system just ca n't sort right , and when you ask for the next 25 , it will just say \" sorry boss , got nothin . \" --- This happens most when you take too long to go to the next page , as time decay in reddit posts can be heavy . edit : Someone said in this thread that the timer of subreddits to show you on the front page has expired , which is very likely to actually be the case here .", "I ca n't say for sure but it is likely because of the parameter in your address bar that reads \" after = asdf123 \" . This is a time stamp of sorts and implies that the content you are seeing is based on a previously cached version of he content . When this cache expires , you get the message you asked about and have to start back from the homepage .", "I 've never run into it on the desktop , but I have that problem on mobil ALL the time , we joke that we 've \" run out of reddit \" Seems to happen mostly when I 'm browsing /r / all , even when I change to \" new \" but then I can scroll up and click \" new \" again and it 'll all be different , you know , new .

A bunch of mad scientists at a company called Black Mesa started shooting lasers at some weird rock , which caused unstable portals between our world and another world called Xen . The main character , Gordon Freeman , survived due to his fancy hazard suit , and began to make his way through the Black Mesa facility , attempting to both escape and get help for his fellow scientists . The U.S. Military is called in , but rather than rescue the survivors , they appear to be under orders to kill all witnesses to the event . Gordon survives , eventually traveling to Xen , and kills a creature that was keeping the portals open . At the end , a mysterious gentlemen referred to as \" G - Man \" ( a slang expression for a federal agent ) is shown to be holding Gordon Freeman in a prison cell between worlds , where he will remain until the G - Man needs him again . At the start of Half - Life 2 , the G - Man 's face appears , and a short speech implies that Gordon has been called into service by the G - Man . What this service might be is a mystery . Gordon gains consciousness on a train , pulling into City 17 , which is presumably somewhere in eastern Europe . A large screen at the train depot shows the face and voice of Dr. Breen , the old Administrator of the Black Mesa facility , who apparently gained power by negotiating Earth 's surrender to the Combine , a race of aliens . The world is under a suppression field which prevents people from breeding , and is under a fascist government run by the Combine . Gordon is saved from the Combine police by Barney Calhoun , a former security guard from Black Mesa and star of Half - Life : Blue Shift . He meets Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Vance , scientists formerly of Black Mesa , and Alyx Vance , Dr. Vance 's hot daughter . They are part of an underground resistance movement , which has kicked into high gear , spurned by Gordon 's arrival . Gordon gets his trademark suit and crowbar , but after a teleporter accident , he is forced to make his way to Dr. Vance 's remote lab on foot . Action happens . Action happens . Dr. Vance is captured by the Combine , having been betrayed by Dr. Judith Mossman , and Alyx and Gordon go to rescue him . In the exciting climax , Gordon is released by Mossman , who had a change of heart , after which he pursues the fleeing Dr. Breen , destroying his escape device and killing Breen in the process . An explosion occurs , during which time slows and freezes , and Gordon watches helplessly as the G - Man approaches , presumably to reclaim his employee .", "Here 's a thing I never understood : At the end of HL2 , Mossman was right there in the Citadel , and when player found her transmission in Ep1 , she was already wherever Borealis is . She had to escape the city , get to White Forest , take a chopper , and fly there , * all that in a matter of hours between HL2 and Ep1 ! *", "There is a very simple explanation to Half Life .

He experiences a war and the infestation of alien beings in what is ultimately just a coma ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 246.0}

Let me tell you a secret! *wink*\n\nYou see, just like how you have toy cameras that are small and cute, but they can only take pictures of tiny things like a tiny toy car or a tiny toy doll, grown-up cameras need to be bigger to take bigger pictures! *exaggerated gesture* It's like how you need a big toy box to put all your toy cars and dolls in, because they're too small to fit in your little toy chest. *chuckles*\n\nSo, grown-up cameras need to be bigger to take bigger pictures like movies and TV shows, because they have to capture lots of details and colors. It's like how you need a big piece of paper to draw a big picture on. *nodding* And just like how you need different colored crayons to make your picture look cool, grown-up cameras have special

In order to fit a small camera on the back of your phone , there 's a lot of compromises that need to be made so that it will fit in that limited space . That will affect the sharpness , clarity , and detail of the image , and when you 're getting paid for top quality shots , a camera phone just does n't cut it .", "It depends what you mean when you are talking about the \" camera \" . For many setups where mobility is n't as important the lens can be as big if not bigger than the camera body so that it can have a larger range of focal distance while maintaining the ability to shoot in low light . For a lot of more mobile camera setups fixed focal length lenses called primes or shorter zoom lenses are used reducing the apparent size of the \" camera \" . I 'm on mobile right now so I ca n't link but if you look up images of the \" red epic \" you 'll see a relatively small body ( about a 7 \" cube ) but it can really be built out to a monster of a camera . Then on the back end larger cameras will have large batteries attached as well as external recorders to record 4k resolution footage or Prores files to be used as dailies or proxies . This can add another 6 or so inches depending on battery profile and build . Finally there is just the camera body itself . This certainly varies when it comes to camera brands and models but generally what you are getting in those larger camera bodies that you are n't getting in a DSLR or a consumer camcorder is processing power . These days cameras are computers , and when it comes to capturing and recording the image that is hitting the sensor it 's all done using algorithms compress the footage to a useable size but still keeping the information needed to give you the most malleable product in post . To do this you need a robust processing system . There are also interface considerations when it comes to professional cameras since they have several outputs on the side ( XLR , SDI , time code sync , remote triggers ) which need room to be easily accessible .

Well, some people thought, \"Hey, why can't we just share everything?!\" And that's where communism comes in. The idea is that everyone should have the same things, like food and houses and clothes, and there shouldn't be any rich or poor people. Everyone should be equal! *exaggerated smile*\n\nHowever, *serious face* sharing everything can be a problem because some people might not work as hard or contribute as much to the community if they know they'll get the same things whether they work hard or not. It's kind of like how you might not want to clean your room if you know your sibling will just come in and mess it up again. *side eye*\n\nAlso, some people might not be very good at sharing and might take advantage of others, or they might not be able to contribute anything to the community.

In order for any individual to survive , he relies on others . For example , you can build a house and farm much more easily when you have another person helping . Communism relies on the individuals ' realization that we depend on each other , and thus have common interests that we have to work toward . If I raise chickens and you grow grain , we need to exchange our goods to each have a healthy diet . In essence , we cooperatively \" own \" the goods we create and we share them . So long as you and I realize that we 're better off when we cooperate , we both are healthy ( and have homes , and all the other goods that come from being a conscientious producer of goods and services ) . However . This spirit of community can be hurt by the lures of competition . If I withhold some of my goods , or try to get as much from you as I can for as little labor as I can put it ( i.e. laziness ) , then the system of cooperation starts to fail . If Bob , Susan , and I help you build your house , and then you give us none of your grain in return , we no longer have a healthy diet . In order for the system to work , you must have people realize that it only works when they believe in the system and help support the ethos through work . Some people believe communism is \" so bad \" because within such a system you ca n't want to have the biggest house , or the fanciest car , and so on . Also , some infamous societal failures in history are often associated with communism , even though they were n't really communist countries . So sometimes when people hear \" communism \" they think of those terrible events in history . For a five year old , you could also think of it like this : We drive cars , and we have lots of rules for car drivers like stopping at a stop sign . It would probably be a good idea to stop at intersections , even if we did n't have stop signs or laws regulating them , as it would make driving safer for everyone . We would be cooperating for the good of everyone . But some people break those driving rules , out of their own personal interest , and so we need ( numerous ) laws ( i.e. external forces , not internal conscientousness ) to guide our behavior . And similarly , communism is a society that thrives on understanding and cooperation , and capitalism exists based on self - interested compeition based on external forces . Communism is n't a bad idea . People are bad !", "There is a question on socialism on the front page that will mostly answer your point . Communism is the \" final stage \" of socialism in which everything is shared without a powerful goverment or any form of social class .", "communism is n't bad at all and works wonderfully in a small scale . look into the zapatista 's in chiapas mexico for a modern day working example . however , when you bring the nation - state into the picture , it becomes the state itself owning everything and everyone . so , communism = fine ( for certain societies ) . state - communism = fucking evil"], "all_classes": "null", "length": 244.66666666666666}

Like rare steak! *nom nom* It's okay to eat rare steak because steak comes from a cow, and cows are big and strong and their meat is special. It's all safe to eat as long as it's cooked just right.\n\nBut chicken is a different story, little dude! *chuckles* Chicken is tiny and cute, but it can also be a little bit trickier to eat sometimes. That's because chickens can get sick sometimes, and when we eat their meat, we want to make sure it's all safe and yummy. That's why we have to cook chicken all the way through, until it's nice and white on the inside. That way, we know it's safe and good to eat!\n\nSo, the difference is: steak is okay to eat rare because steer are big and tough, but chicken is tiny and cute, so we have to be extra careful with it.

. * the living environment of the original create e.g. caught in the wild , or raised on a farm . * the types of parasites / pathogens that the creatures are likely to be exposed to . The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more \" spongy \" like chicken rather than \" layered \" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * . Even though generally the risk is exaggerated through public policy ( for good reason ) , the risk is still present - so healthy adults may risk it with relative safety - but pregnant women , young children , immuno - compromised people , and the elderly should never take the risk . Hope that answers everything for you .", "Poultry must be cooked properly because of Salmonella . Red meats like steak have the harmful bacteria on the outside of the cuts of meat - the contamination will usually come from the digestive system or other contaminates picked up through the path through the slaughterhouse . Properly searing the meat will remove significant levels of nasties . If the meat has been scored or minced , the contamination can spread to the entire piece of meat , thus needing proper cooking .", "Ahh this reminds me of when I went off to college and started cooking on my own .

Well, the stock market is like a really big game, and insider trading is like breaking one of the big rules. *exaggerated expression*\n\nSee, insider trading is when someone has secret information about a company, like a magical crystal ball that shows them the future of the company. They use that secret information to make money by buying or selling shares of the company's stock without telling anyone else about the secret! *excited nod*\n\nBut the problem is, everyone else is playing the game with information that is publicly available, like the weather or how many cupcakes are in the cookie jar. It's not fair when some people get to use secret information to win the game! *stomps foot*\n\nThink of it like a big team project in school.

Insider trading allows you to cheat your way to lots of money at the expense of others by having access to corporate secrets that the general public does not have access to ( e.g. because you work for the company you are investing in ) and using that knowledge to buy and sell shares precisely when it 's most advantageous . For example , if you are an employee at Microsoft and you know they are just about to announce some amazing new revolutionary product tomorrow but no one else outside the company knows this , then clearly that is an unfair advantage . Likewise , if you know Microsoft is just about to announce a surprise profit loss , you can sell your shares to unlucky buyers at a high price and bail out before the stock crashes . It 's a bit like working for a lottery company and knowing what the winning lottery numbers will be and then playing those numbers . You have access to secret information that nobody else does and if you abused that information , you would pretty much have a guaranteed win every single time at the expense of others .", "It 's not allowed because the stock market is a closed system . Meaning , for every winner there is a loser . And if the losers keep losing they are not going to want to play any more . So , lets say , you have insider information that your companies stock is going to tank tomorrow . You decide to use this information and sell your stock today . Now , what does \" sell \" actually mean , it means you are selling this stock to another individual . That individual is purchasing it because they do not know what you know ( this is called information asymmetry ) . Tomorrow that individual is going to lose a pile of money . Now , the stock market only works when normal people come to play . If normal people think the tables are fixed they are not going to be interested in playing the game . Without the \" dumb money \" as it 's called , the market can not function . Information asymmetry is poison to a smooth functioning market .

If you 're selling someone a car , and you know it 's had serious body damage such that it 's likely to fall apart at speeds over 45 mph , you 're generally obliged to tell them so that they know they 're buying an expensive pile of scrap metal . Point is , if you 're selling someone a property and you * know * that property is bad , but did n't tell them , that 's arguably fraud . It 's especially bad if the person performing the sale is an executive of the company who knows things are about to tank , so specifically arranges to sell high , right before investors discover the awful truth .

Let's dive into how Prohibition became a law in the United States! *excited squeals*\n\nSo, you know how there are things that are good for us, like food and drinks that make us feel happy and healthy? Well, some grown-ups a long time ago thought that drinking alcohol (like beer, wine, or liquor) was one of those things that wasn't so good for us. They said it made people act weird and hurt their bodies, so they wanted to stop it.\n\nThese grownups formed a movement called the \"Temperance Movement\" and they worked really hard to convince lawmakers that Prohibition was a good idea. They even had some famous friends like Leonardo DiCaprio (just kidding, he wasn't born yet!), but they did have some super-supportive people like Cesar Chavez and Susan B. Anthony. They spoke at rallies, handed out flyers, and even marched in protests! *makes protest sign*\n\nPretty soon, enough lawmakers listened to the Temperance Movement that they decided to make it illegal for anyone to make, sell, or drink alcohol.

that 's not often talked about is that Americans drank a lot of alcohol prior to prohibition . I mean , like , a really lot . About a pint per day for every man , woman and child . That 's because the government used to give out money to farmers if they would produce corn . Soon , American farmers were producing more corn than people in the country could eat , so we had to come up with ways to use corn without simply cooking it up an eating it . Later on , we 'd start using it to make corn syrup to sweeten things , and a version of plastic that was less bad for the earth , but before all of that the simplest way to get rid of our extra corn was to make liquor out of it . We had so much cheap corn that people made a lot of liquor , and when you have a lot of something , you ca n't charge too much for it , because people can always buy it somewhere else for cheaper . So before prohibition , the price for liquor made out of booze was really low . It was , in fact , the cheapest drink available in most places , so people drank it all the time . It was common for people to have it on their lunch break at work . Religious people were , for the most part , in favor of Prohibition , but politicians were for it in part because Americans really were drinking too much . [ citation ] ( URL_0 )", "Blackstar9000 and Stodavar have pointed out some solid reasons . But it also happened because [ Wayne B Wheeler ] ( URL_0 ) figured out how to organize pressure groups to lobby congress . Today , people who make laws get advice from people called lobbyists , who are really good at talking to congressmen . The lobbyists are often lawyers who help write the laws they want . The lobbyist 's boss will be the president of a non profit group , whose job is to get money from concerned citizens or corporations who want to get laws changed . The pressure group has lists of voters who agree with their cause , and they have their people write letters , call , or demonstrate in the streets to show their cangressman what they want . Today , there are organized pressure groups who ask congress for just about everything , and they sort of balance each other out . But when the first pressure group got started to fight alchohol , it was a brand new thing , and leaders thought that many Americans wanted alcohol banned . In fact , it was a small group who organized themselves to make a lot of noise .", "In the late 1800s and early 1900s , there were lots of people who thought alcohol was a very bad thing . They thought it made especially men spend all their money at bars and taverns and beat up their wives and children . In addition , though , lots of people who were high - up in society thought this problem was mostly with poor people and people who 'd just arrived in the United States . At this time in American history , lots of people who were middle and upper - class thought they needed to teach poor people and new immigrants how to behave themselves . So they passed laws against alcohol to try to get people to behave more respectably ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 244.33333333333334}

Maybe you put a few coins in there each week or month. That's like compound interest! 💰\n\nHere's the thing: every time you add money to your piggy bank, the money you already had in there starts to earn more money too. It's like a magic piggy bank that grows and grows on its own! 🧚‍♀️\n\nNow, imagine you had a really, really big piggy bank – like a whole bank account! Every time you put money in there, it earns even more money because of something called \"time.\" Time is like a magic machine that makes money grow faster and faster! 🚀\n\nThat's what compound interest is: money growing on top of money because of time. It's like a never-ending cycle of money magic! 🏰\n\nBut how do we calculate it? *adjusts glasses again* Well, that's where calculus", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

1.5+(0.5 * 1.5 ) = 2.25 So your interest for the year is : 1 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 1*(1.5)^2 Because each six month period , your money is multiplied by 1.5 ( adding 50 % ) . If you do it 1/10th of the year for 10 % , the equation becomes : 1*(1.1)^10=2.59 ... Every 1/100th of the year for 1 % 1*(1.01)^100=2.705 ...

But Really : e is the base rate of growth for all systems that grow over time ( like populations and interest ) . Like every circle can be be considered a scale version of the unit circle and every number can be considered a scale version of the number 1 , so too can every growing system be considered a scaled version of e. That 's how I 've always thought of e. Basically , it 's a base unit that all other growing systems can use ( that 's why it 's used in the \" natural log \" ) . It 's also why we use e to describe ALL systems that have a growth rate ( like spirals , snail shells , interest , radioactive decay , and populations ) . The spiral on a snail 's shell is has radial growth outward , interest compounds regularly . As long as it has a constant growth rate , you can describe it with e. Think of it like this : If you have a circle , any circle , it 'll always meet the same properties as a The Unit Circle ( angles will always be the same , the equations will be the same ) . It 's radius - to - diameter ratio will always equal pi . The same way in a growing system . It will always have certain properties and those properties will always be able to be described by scaling e ( just multiplying , dividing by e ) .

Well, the Bahá'í Faith is another one of those religions. It was started by a man named Bahá'u'lláh, who lived a long time ago in the country of Persia (which is now called Iran).\n\nBahá'u'lláh believed that there is one God, and that all people are like brothers and sisters. He thought that it didn't matter what religion you were born into, what was important was treating others with kindness and respect.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith has some special practices, like praying, reading sacred writings, and sharing meals with other Bahá'ís. They also have some special days that they celebrate, like a holy day called the Nineteen Days of Fasting, and a festival called the Feast.\n\nOne of the most important things about the Bahá'í Faith is that it teaches people to be tolerant and understanding of other religions. Bahá'u'lláh believed that even though different religions have their own beliefs and practices, they all come from the same God.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Of",

incomplete message , but one that would be understood by the people of that time . Krishna , the Buddha , Abraham , Jesus , and Muhammad were all revealing the True word of God , but God intentionally left the message incomplete . Sayyid Ali - Muhammad claimed that he knew the Mahdi was coming , and that he would be able to identify the Mahdi . The Mahdi is a messianic figure in twelve Shi'ite Islam who will bring a new age in which the world will be in union with the law of God . Mírzá Husayn ` Alí Núrí was the one who the Bab \" prophesied , \" he claimed to be the Mahdi . His teachings were written by his son , and Ali Nuri was proclaimed to be , all at once , the Mahdi ( messianic figure of Islam ) , the Matreiya ( messianic figure of Mahayana Buddhism ) , and the Messiah ( or Second coming of Christ ) . Basically , because all \" universal \" religions claimed that a Divinely Inspired figure would appear sometime in the future to bring forth a New Age , the Baha'u'llah ( Ali Nuri ) and the Bab asserted that this was proof that all religions were in part correct , and furthermore claimed that Ali Nuri possessed all of the qualities of this figure . According to Baha'i , the teachings recorded by Ali Nuri 's son encapsulate the complete teaching of the One True God . In other words , all of the other Holy Scriptures are incomplete revelations of the Word of God , while Ali Nuri 's teaching fill in the blanks and provide the full and complete Word of God .", "Interestingly most of the comments on this page are about the Baha'i attitude towards other religions , the Baha'i Faith has some interesting teachings in itself .

If you do n't want to read it here are some quotes i cherry picked : * * \" Any religious belief which is not conformable with scientific proof and investigation is superstition , for true science is reason and reality , and religion is essentially reality and pure reason ; therefore , the two must correspond . \" * * * * \" He has declared that in the estimation of God there is no distinction of sex . The one whose heart is most pure , whose deeds and service in the Cause of God are greater and nobler , is most acceptable before the divine threshold — whether male or female . In the vegetable and animal kingdoms sex exists in perfect equality and without distinction or invidious estimate . The animal , although inferior to man in intelligence and reason , recognizes sex equality . \" * * * * \" No individual should be denied or deprived of intellectual training , although each should receive according to capacity . None must be left in the grades of ignorance , for ignorance is a defect in the human world . \" * *", "I live about an hour from the Baha'i gardens .

Are you ready to learn about it? 😊\n\nYou know how sometimes you might feel a little grumpy after not having dessert for a while? Maybe you're a little cranky and just want to play with your toys instead of doing your homework? *chuckles* That's kind of like how some people feel when they're not drinking alcohol for a while. But, sometimes when people drink a lot of alcohol for a long time, their body can get very confused and have a hard time adjusting when they stop drinking. It's like their body is playing a game of \"Silly Putty\" and it can get all stretchy and confused! 🤯\n\nYou see, alcohol is a kind of special medicine that helps our bodies feel happy and relaxed. It's like a hug from a friendly dragon! *exaggerated dragon impression* But, just like how too much of a hug can be bad, too much alcohol can be bad too. Sometimes our bodies can get too much of a good thing, and when we stop drinking, it can be really hard for our bodies to figure out what to do.

When you suddenly stop drinking , it takes your body a while to realize it needs to make those chemicals again . The lag time between stopping alcohol and chemical production can be a decent amount of time . That 's \" withdrawal \" , basically . With alcohol and benzos , that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you . Edit ; as others have corrected me , I figured I 'd add this for clarity . My post is mostly right , but backwards . The brain does n't stop making chemicals . It makes way too much , and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much . So when you stop drinking , the brain is still making a ton of stuff , but it 's all working now instead of being blocked by the alcohol . Sorry for the mix up . My source is a class I took in college a few years ago , and I remembered the gist of it without the details . Thanks again for the corrections ! Also , as a word of warning , this shit is serious . When you read that you can die from alcohol or benzo withdrawal , that means YOU CAN DIE . If you or someone you know is trying to get clean off these , they really should check into a clinic or hospital to be safe . Or at least have someone with some knowledge really closely monitor symptoms , and be willing to call for an ambulance if need be . Edit2 . Benzos , not barbs . Fixed that in my original post . I 'm screwing up all over the details . Damnit .", "Because it 's legal , we forget that alcohol is really a pretty powerful drug . It affects countless systems and processes throughout the body and has many interactions with other drugs . Neurologically , alcohol acts as a ' depressant , ' meaning that it causes an overall reduction in brain activity . Overtime , you brain can get used to this effect and stop producing natural chemicals that work to depress brain activity . This is physical addiction . When someone strongly physically addicted to alcohol abruptly stops , nothing is there to counter the brain 's normal excitability , since it has stopped making depressants due to the chronic presence of alcohol . This excitability can continue uncontrolled and is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal , such as seizures , which ultimately may lead to the alcoholic 's death . You can avoid the serious withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering off the amount you drink .", "ELI5 answer : Alcohol is a depressant and affects the brain by decreasing brain activity . With extended alcohol use , the brain tries to balance this effect by increasing its own excitatory activity . When alcohol use is abruptly stopped , the brain can not adjust quickly enough and that leads to withdrawal due to hyperactivity of the brain . Physically , this typically starts with increased blood pressure , heart rate , and respiration later leading to confusion , delirium , and seizures , and can ultimately lead to death if not properly treated . People in withdrawal are treated by giving them alcohol or medications that act the same way ( benzodiazepines ) so that they can slowly be weaned off .

They use something called \"vinyl\" to make the music. When you put the record on your turntable, the needle (like a tiny finger) reads the music pressed into the record and sends it to your receiver and speakers. It's like the record is telling a story, and the receiver and speakers are like big ears that listen to the story and play it back to you! 🤝\n\nCDs, on the other hand, are like small cards that have music saved inside them.

The longer answer : CDs are digital , they are made up of pieces of information that are 0 or 1 . This means they are normally perfectly precise and consistent . That 0 will always be a 0 , the 1 , always a 1 . Records are analog , they 're information is effectively the same as CDs , only CDs are an approximation of the record . They do n't have * * exactly * * the same information , but the difference is so negligable that people ca n't tell the difference . The only difference comes from the changes of the record . A record , overtime could conceivably sound slightly different , CDs basically either work or they do n't . This imperfection might be what he considers \" better \" .", "it 's a matter of taste : imagine a cd is like the light in your room , you flick the switch , the light turns on and fills the room evenly now a record is more like a candle , you have to light it first , and the light flickers and fills the room unevenly and in a less predictable way many people argue that the light is more convenient and does a better job of illuminating the space , but anyone who 's ever had a candlelight dinner will tell you that candles are much more intimate and there 's a certain richness to their light true candle lovers will even tell you that the lighting of the candle itself is fun as well", "It 's similar to how a digital photo is different from an analog one if you look * very * closely . Because in digital all data is stored as numbers rather than something that exists in the real world , there is a limit on how big those numbers can be . If you look too closely ( or listen too closely , in the case of digital audio ) you can see / hear where one \" number \" describing a color or audio frequency \" jumps \" into the next number next to it . Like from 3 to 5 to 4 to 3 again and so on ... It looks like a \" staircase \" with little \" steps \" between each value instead of a smooth transition . With analog storage , we have a \" real \" , physical copy that might get more \" grainy \" if you look / listen too close , but it will always be \" smooth \" . If the digital quality ( how big and precise the numbers are to describe the picture / audio ) is good enough , however , the human ear ca n't tell the difference . And many would say that a CD actually is good enough nobody could tell the difference . Now some people say a traditional record sounds better because it sounds \" warmer \" , often even including the errors that come from scratches on the record as part of why it feels more \" real \" . That 's not the entire truth , though . There are certain sounds that are very hard to describe as digital numbers and you * can * hear the difference if you listen closely . With modern MP3 formats , this gets even more complicated because they \" leave out \" certain frequencies the human ear supposedly ca n't hear . Some people say that they * can * hear them , though , and miss them in MP3s ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 251.66666666666666}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nWhat 's the difference between Pubs and Bars ? And where do pubs get their names ? Just a thought that has crossed my mind a couple times - I also wondered why so many pubs have the same , or similar names ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Pubs and bars are kind of like siblings, but they're different in some ways. Pubs are short for \"public houses,\" which means they're places where people can go to drink and socialize with others in the community. Bars, on the other hand, are just places where you can go to drink. They don't have to be public or community-based, they can be privately owned and still serve drinks.\n\nNow, where do pubs get their names? *grins* Well, a long time ago, people didn't have fridges at home, so they'd go to the local pub to buy food and drinks! Pubs were also places where people could gather and chat with their neighbors, become friends, and even fall in love! *giggles* And that's why many pubs have similar names, like \"The Red Lion\" or \"The Green Dragon.\" These names are like a family history, you know? They're a way to remember important events or people from the past.\n\nThink of it like a big family reunion! Everyone's gathered at the pub, enjoying drinks and each other's company, and sharing stories about their ancestors.

The word pub comes from the name public house . It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found . Bars are more aimed at night time and weekend rushes and are a more commercial location", "I was always under the impression a \" bar \" is a feature ( usually a counter ) in an establishment that serves it 's specialty . For example ; oyster bars serve seafood , salad bars serve bunny - food , alcohol bars serve alcohol . Similar to a kitchen , which prepares food in a restaurant . So a pub could have a kitchen and bar inside meaning it serves food and alcohol .", "In the US , the term bar pretty generically apples to all drinking establishments while a pub refers to a place that tries to capture the style and atmosphere of a UK pub . A bar can be a dive bar , shorts bar , wine bar , dance club , night club , tavern , pub or any of a countless number of other types of drinking establishment . It can range from a tiny 3 seater at the back of a restaurant to a sprawling multi acre monstrosity ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 255.33333333333334}

They're found all over the world, and they're actually the most intelligent birds in the world! *impressed face*\n\nNow, you might be wondering, how do they know where to go? *peers curiously* Well, the thing is, ravens are very curious birds. They love exploring new places, and they have this amazing ability to map out their surroundings in their minds! *mind-blown*\n\nYou see, ravens use landmarks and their surroundings to create mental maps of their territory. They observe their surroundings, and they can even recognize different shapes and patterns. It's like they have their own little raven GPS system in their brains! 😮\n\nBut that's not all!

I have never really understood how pyramid schemes work and how they get so massive ? Explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Pyramid schemes are like a really big puzzle, and they can be tricky to understand. But don't worry, I'm here to explain it to you in a way that's easy peasy! 😊\n\nOkay, so imagine you have a toy box full of blocks. Each block has a letter on it, like A, B, or C. The blocks are stacked on top of each other, and they make a big pyramid! 🏛️ That's kind of like a pyramid scheme.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The person who started the scheme (let's call them the \"leader\") asks people to join by giving them some money and a block from the toy box. The leader promises that if you give them money and a block, they'll give you back more blocks and money in return! 🤑\n2. The next person the leader asks to join gives them money and a block, and the leader gives them back some money and a few blocks that they didn't have before. This is where the scheme gets bigger and bigger! 🚀\n3. The leader keeps taking money and blocks from more and more people, and they promise everyone that they'll give them back even more blocks and money", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob":

I believe I was after a G4 PowerBook and they were offering it for $ 100 . But , you had to wait a certain amount of time for others to contribute their $ 100 . So , if the PowerBook cost $ 1000 , after 11 people contributed $ 100 , the person organizing the scheme would buy a PowerBook and send it to the first person that contributed , and pocket $ 100 for themselves . Then , for the next person to get THEIR PowerBook , another 11 people need to contribute $ 100 for the organizer to buy another PowerBook ( and pocket another $ 100 ) and so on . The other contributors in the \" queue \" are encouraged to entice others to join in . So you see how each PowerBook purchase requires more and more people - if you picture each purchase as a level in a pyramid , you see how it expands downward . It actually starts out kind've well , especially if you 're the first contributor . The problem of course is that sooner or later , the pyramid will collapse on itself because so many people are waiting for their PowerBook . I was about 21 , desperate for a Mac laptop and broke . There was a few sites running these schemes and my stupid young brain actually thought it was a good idea . Before I actually put any money I 'm , I figured out the whole \" collapse on itself \" thing and did n't do it .", "A man , lets call him Rob tells everyone if they give him $ 5 in 2 weeks he will give them $ 10 . Lots of people are interested in Robs deal and the first 2 weeks he gets 10 people who give him $ 5 each . Rob has $ 50 . Rob uses some of his own money to pay everyone back . All of Robs investors are happy as they have doubled their money in 2 weeks . The next 2 weeks word spreads and Rob has 200 investors giving him $ 5 each . Word spreads and 1 week later Rob has 1000 investors giving him $ 5 each . So far Rob has paid in his own money $ 50 and he now has been given $ 5000 even though he has n't actually done anything . Rob then tells all his investors he lost their money and that the scheme was not a guarantee . Everyone is pissed off , except Rob ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 232.33333333333334}

The cost of living in places like New York City (NYC) and Los Angeles (LA) can be really expensive! 😱 But don't worry, I'm here to help you understand how people with minimum wage jobs can still get by in these big cities. 🏙️\n\nYou see, people with minimum wage jobs in NYC or LA still have to pay their bills, just like everyone else. They have to pay for things like food, housing, transportation, and other necessities. But the problem is, these expenses can be really expensive in these big cities. 🤯 For example, the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment in NYC is over $3,000 per month! 🏠😱 That's a lot of money that a person with a minimum wage job would have to pay every month.\n\nSo, how do they make ends meet? 🤔 Well, they have to be really smart about their money.

them , and often live with their parents or with several roommates .", "Hi ! I 'm from New York . You 've gotten some good answers , but maybe I can help go more in - depth . The very first thing to remember is that in more expensive cities , wages rise with cost inflation . Now , it 's not a perfect scale-- most of the cost inflation comes because many people are * very * rich , not necessarily because the poor are less poor . However , it 's still a factor-- there are fewer minimum wage jobs , and/or you 're more likely to get a job whose wages are above the federal minimum . In other words , chances are the same job netting you $ 7.25 in Nebraska will get you around $ 10 in NYC . Now that 's not 100 % true . There are still * some * minimum wage jobs here . How do people get by ? Well , about like anywhere else , I suppose . They do n't get to enjoy many aspects of the city where inflation has taken hold . They do n't get to go out to dinner at the nice restaurants or go drinking in NYC bars . They ca n't go to Whole Foods , they have to go to cheaper grocery stores . They have to curb themselves more , and * * they get government assistance * * like anywhere else . Remember , the farther you go from NYC the cheaper things get , so many times people will live far away from the city if they do n't make a lot . And if they 're living far away from the city , and working a minimum wage job ... they can just as easily find one near where they live . Hence , like I said , there being less minimum wage jobs in the city . It all ... * kinda * evens out . You 're not likely to live in NYC and have a minimum wage job as an adult . Matter of fact I ca n't think of a single minimum wage job I 've had , and I 've made the rounds as a student . Office worker , busboy , waiter , receptionist ... they all paid around $ 10 . And one last thing to remember : The cost of living does n't * have * to be high in this city . It 's totally doable on less money . The reason it seems higher is that it * can * be higher . And most people making very little tend to have a social circle where people make standard ( remember how I said there are n't many minimum wage jobs here ? It 's rare ) So what happens is most of your friends can go do things and spend money where you can't-- so it * seems * like everything has to be so expensive here . But it does n't , really . Like I said earlier , there are cheap places to live , there are cheap restaurants , cheap grocery stores . There are plenty of free activities for entertainment . This city actually caters very well to the poor , it 's just difficult if your social circle is n't as poor as you ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 236.0}

You start playing into expectations , using ' big words ' because A ) you can suss out their meaning from context clues faster than most people and B ) because people expect you to . Eventually you become the \" big words \" kid . You 're a nerd if you 're in regular public school .

You probably have anxiety or depression or something resembling ADD , just because your mind wanders more readily and over - processes everything . Personally I 'm convinced that being human requires a certain amount of psychic energy and having a high IQ generates a surplus which can be destructive if you 're not engaged all the time . Games are good ( board and video ) because the ruleset and journey towards mastery gives your brain a chewtoy . You generally pick up on games faster than most . You are probably generally smarter than the people you work for . This can lead to frustration when they make decisions you do n't agree with because whether you 're more correct or not you get the nagging sense that you probably are .

Well, sometimes when a lot of people are playing the same game at the same time, the computers that make the game work can get really overwhelmed. This is called a \"server issue.\" *nodding*\n\nThink of it like a really busy restaurant. Imagine you and your friends wanted to play a game of tag at the restaurant, but there were too many people already playing and it got really confusing. That's kind of like what happens with the servers in online games. They can get really busy and stop working properly. *eye-open wide*\n\nBut, you know what? Game companies like Blizzard are really good at making games, and they're always trying to make them even better. They have special people called \"engineers\" who are like superheroes because they can fix things like the server problems. They're always working on ways to make the games run smoothly, even when a lot of people are playing. It's like they have a secret plan to make the games work better and better. *wink*\n\nAnd here's the thing, little friend: just like how you might not be able to play a game with your friends when

Let 's say that , on any day after release , they can expect to have 1000 players online at a time . They buy servers that can support 1500 people at a time . This allows the system to function quite well 99 % of the time , and even allows a good buffer for weekends and update days . On day of release , though , 3000 people want online . This obviously does not jive well . The servers crash , and everyone is angry . Blizzard continues to get the servers running again for about 3 days , when the server load goes down to around the number they expect . Everyone is still mad , but not everyone is trying to play at once and the system is running smoothly . Most people forget about the whole thing and play the game as expected within a week . The cost of buying a lot of servers is not justified for the few day rush when a game comes out .", "As a whole it is not worth it to plan for a ' flawless day one release ' . Its very similar to building your own PC . If your only playing League of Legends and WoW , do you really NEED those two top of the line video cards linked together on an i7 motherboard with all of the fixings ? Or can you just get away with a 770Ti and chug along at 80 frames anyways ? Wasted processing power is wasted money . Blizzard on WoD release also had another issue that they wrote a small article about and they did do server upgrades to accommodate for it . Their subscriber base jumped nearly 3 million over a quarter of a fiscal year . Setting up new infrastructure for that to be the new baseline is a nightmare in and of itself considering that many of those accounts could be legacy accounts ( pre URL_0 standardization ) . In the days following the release blizzard fired up their free account times and tried to maintain open contact with irate customers . After the initial tidal wave of customers however , things have been pretty smooth across the board . Server transfers were opened and taken , and players are chugging through content . TLDR : do nt waste time with ' flawless for a minute ' use your time on what works in the long run .", "They could account for it , but they would need a massive number of servers , an order of magnitude more bandwidth , etc . The logistical and financial nightmare that they would have to undertake to have a flawless launch day simply is n't worth the cost and effort ; after a few days load comes back down within acceptable limits and they credit people lost time and fire up the PR machine . I design failover systems and the like for enterprise businesses . If you want something that can handle 2 million people around the world simultaneously trying to connect and use an application that is latency - sensitive , you need some serious hardware , bandwidth , support from competent data centers and service providers , and a solid anycast infrastructure with geographic diversity . Damn , I 'm with Blizzard on this . Let the servers buckle and crumble while data center links peg out at 100 % capacity for a few days . Dealing with the aftermath is easier than building a server farm that rivals Google ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 241.66666666666666}

The idea is that space , time , matter and energy existed in an ultra dense , ultra tiny point , and then just expanded until it was the size of the universe How or why any of that stuff actually got there is not answered by the big bang theory A much better ( in my opinion ) theory ( though it is still just a theory ) is inflation theory . Maybe a physicist can explain this properly , but what i got from reading brian green is basically this - At the beginning of the universe was an Inflaton field ( again , the theory can not explain how it got there ) . The inflaton field is beleived to be like a magnetic field , except it exists throughout the entire universe and has equal energy everyway ( maybe : s ) . Basically the Inflaton field existed in an ultra high energy state , and like boiling water , frothed around differant energy values . When a part of the field the size of a football ( apparently ) reached a certain value ( because it was bouncing around lots of values ) , that football sized chunk expanded a mind buggering distance at a ball flattening speed . This happened essentially because that s just the way the field is - when it hits that value it just does that Special relativity states that all mass is actually like a condensed lump of energy ( lots of energy ) , and this inflaton field had a really appalling amount of energy . As it expanded , it cooled down , and as it cooled down the various fundamental components of nature crystallised . Kind of like the boiling water freezing and forming ice crystals . The awesome part of all this is that the theory has offered testable predictions which have been confirmed ( like the pattern of microwave energy left behind across the universe ) and the theory implies that the universe 's actual size is so huge that the actual part we can see ( we can see quite a lot of stuff bty ) is to that whole universe as a grain of sand is to the earth . Also there maybe lots of universes - not parallel like in sci - fi movies , but floating around in bubbles and bumping into each other That 's the best i can do . Maybe a physicist can explain in more detail , but i have the feeling that you can only really see the truth of it if you understand a lot of very complicated mathematics PS - please do n't hurt me physics buffs - i m only an english student . Also please do nt hurt brian greene , he makes me feel like i get it :)", "There was nothing , then it exploded ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 238.66666666666666}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow do we know that no two snowflakes are alike ? This is what gets me : what if there ARE duplicates or types that we just have n't been able to collect and observe because ... you know ... blizzards and mountaintops ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Wow, that's a great question! *adjusts glasses* Well, you know how you have a unique face? Like, no one else has the same smile or eyebrows as you? *nodding* Snowflakes work the same way! 🌨\n\nEach snowflake is made up of tiny ice crystals in the sky. These crystals grow and move around in the air, making different shapes and patterns. It's kind of like how you might draw a picture with different shapes and colors. But, just like how your hand moves when you're drawing, the crystals in the snowflake keep growing and moving too, so each one is a little different! 🎨\n\nThat's why no two snowflakes are exactly alike. They might have some similarities, like a round shape or some pointy bits, but they're all unique. It's like they have their own little \"snowflake fingerprint\"! 😆 And, just like how you might find some duplicate toys in your toybox, sometimes scientists find duplicate snowflakes too. But they're super rare, like finding a duplicate smile! 😊\n\nSo, the next time you're building a snowman or having a snowball fight, just remember that", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob":

very very unusual to see two identical ones .

That said , there is no law that says there can not be two identical flakes ( and you 're right-- there very well could be and we 'd never even know it ) , but probability says it 's just very , very unlikely .", "At the earliest stages , when a flake is about 10 molecules big , they are in fact identical . However , the flakes we see contain roughly 1 quintillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ) molecules ! Imagine you and I both have a bookcase , and we have the same books : Fight Club , Pride and Prejudice , and The Hobbit . What are the odds that we 'll put our books in the same order ? There are six different possible orders ( F , P , H ; F , H , P ; P , F , H ; P , H , F ; H , P , F ; H , F , P ) , so the odds are 1 in 6 . If we got 6 people with the same 3 books , there 's a good chance two of us would have the same order , and if we added a 7th person we 'd be guaranteed that at least two people have the same order . If we each had 5 books , there 'd be 120 different possible orders . Odds that you and I picked the same order are low , and even with 6 or 7 people , there 's still little chance of there being any matches . With 8 books we 're up to over 40,000 possibilities , at 10 books we 're at 3.6 million , and with 15 books we 'd be over 1 trillion ! In fact , there 's 1.3 trillion ways to arrange a mere 15 books ! Now imagine you 've got 1 quintillion books ! My computer 's calculator ca n't even handle the math ! It breaks down somewhere between 3000 and 3500 . Long way off from a quintillion ! Of course we have to then wonder how many snowflakes there are . Every year about 1 septillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ) flakes fall . I do n't know how many different flake designs there are , but it 's a number a lot bigger than that ! * * Edit * * : To give a better idea for the scale of the number of arrangements there are , imagine we both have 1 million books . That 's waaay less than the quintillion molecules in a snowflake . We 're choosing which book to put in the first slot ( we 've got a huuuge bookcase ) . Odds that we pick the same book is 1 in 1,000,000 . Now we put in the second book . Odds that we 've picked the same first two books in the same order are 1 in 999,999,000,000 ( 1 in 1,000,000 x 999,999 ) . Odds we have the same first * three * books would be 1 in 999,997,000,002,000,000 ( 1,000,000 x 999,999 x 999,998 ) . You can see how these numbers get very big , very fast .

They believe that lower taxes and less government intervention will encourage people and businesses to make more money, and that will lead to economic growth and prosperity. They also want to make it easier for businesses to import and export goods, because they think that will create jobs and make the economy stronger.\n\n Democrats are like the player who wants to collect money fair and square, by building houses and hotels on their properties, and charging rent to other players. They believe that the government should play a bigger role in helping people and businesses that are struggling, by providing things like food stamps, healthcare, and education. They also want to make sure that everyone has a fair chance to play the game, by enforcing rules that protect workers' rights and the environment.\n\nInternationally, the differences between Republicans and Democrats can be a bit trickier to understand, but here's the simplified version:\n\nRepublicans are like a trading partner who wants to make a deal and exchange goods.

They believe that given the chance , most people will work . However there are a significant percentage of people who are not working because of issues surrounding education , child care , health or other aspects of being poor . Essentially they want to \" help people up , so they can get back to work \" Getting more people to work will improve their quality of life AND bring in additional tax money ( because working people pay more taxes ) . Basically they want to soften the landing so when people fall off the ladder they can get back on and keep climbing . Democrats feel that if you give extra money to rich people they are only going to spend it on rich people things and that wo n't benefit poor people at all . Republicans are the opposite . They think that if you give money to people who are not working , you create an incentive to be a lazy ass . They think that if you make it harsher to be poor , fewer people will want to be poor and therefore more people will work . They also feel that if you give tax breaks to the wealthy then those wealthy people will use that money to invest in businesses who will turn that investment into jobs . Generally republicans favor lower taxes in an effort to increase the tax basis . Democrats want to increase the tax basis by spending money to bring poor people up to a level where they can be productive workers .", "In an attempt to summarize this as simply as possible with minimal bias : Republicans ( in general ) believe the free market is the best way to run the economy . This means that they support minimal government regulation and taxation of businesses . The theory is that if everyone does business in the most effective way for them , then everyone will benefit from overall economic growth . Republicans tend to have an ideology of \" small government \" in this way . Democrats are less trusting of the free market . They tend to argue that just because a business makes money , it does not follow that everyone who contributes to that business will as well . They argue that since the rich have more money , they have more power in the free market and so the free market does n't necessarily help the people who need it . To deal with this , democrats tend to support taxing and regulating businesses more so the money can be spent on public programs , particularly those that help those with less money . Keep in mind , this is pretty simplified , and just my understanding of it as an American who does n't affiliate with any party , but still sits slightly left - of - center politically . I hope this helps a bit .", "To add to what /u / hot4you11 said , Republicans believe that by reducing taxes for the rich and allowing them to keep more of their money then they will buy more stuff and thereby help the economy move . Republicans also see high taxes on the rich as punishing success . They also believe that by lowering taxes and cutting spending they can actually increase gov't revenues . How ? With more money to spend , people will do more and thereby allow for more taxing opportunities . This is , of course , complete bullshit .

born without eyesight , and we call them blind ? They do n't see anything , you can imagine what it 's like to be blind by closing your eyes and never , ever opening them . And a deaf person was born without hearing , like if you stuck your fingers in your ears and never took them out ? A sociopath is a person who was born without a conscience . They are born to never know the difference between right and wrong . You know how you feel when you know you 've done something bad ? A sociopath does n't feel that feeling . They simply do n't have the ability to feel bad about things they do wrong , just like a blind person ca n't see .", "Funny enough , this is a good question for a five - year - old , since technically speaking , many five - year - olds fit the definition of sociopathy ! The difference is , they grow out of it . A sociopath , as I understand it , lacks the ability to empathize with anyone or anything else . Think about little kids trying to share toys : when one decides he wants what the other has , he just takes it , because that 's what he wants . He ca n't understand yet that the other child has wants too , and that those wants matter just as much as his own . If he hurts the other child , he does n't really understand the concept of \" sorry , \" because he 's not old enough yet to understand hurting other people . Kids who * are n't * sociopaths ( and who have at least vaguely decent parental input ) grow out of this : as their brains mature , they gain the ability to relate to other people , to understand that hurting other people is n't OK , and to feel empathy for people who are hurt or sad . A sociopath never gains that empathy , so he remains stuck in \" little kid \" mode : I want what I want now , and why would it matter to me what other people want or feel about it ? Just like a little kid , this can lead to lots of problems later : things like empathy help us control our impulses not to do things that hurt other people or break laws , while a sociopath wo n't have those tools . Genuine sociopaths are often not like the clever schemers you see on TV : without impulse control , they often act out so much that they 're caught quickly ( although some are not ! ) . My father tells the story of a patient that had attempted suicide by putting a gun to his temple and pulling the trigger , but had missed and simply blown out his frontal lobe instead . My dad met him when Dad was an intern , and the patient now showed signs of being much like a sociopath : he no longer felt empathy at all , and no longer understood \" rules \" except as he chose to make them . He would happily grab a cupcake off another patient 's tray simply because he wanted it , and could n't seem to understand at all what might be wrong with doing that .", "They do n't feel guilty about doing bad things , if they follow rules it is a completely logical decision ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 253.0}

First , plain old modernism was all about reducing things to their simplest , purest forms . Painting is n't about portraying scenes , it 's about paint on a canvas , a chair is n't decorative or symbolic , it 's should be a chair , as simply as possible , etc . Postmodernism began as a reaction to that , questioning everything . \" What even is a canvas ? What even is a chair ? \" It has typically involved a lot of deconstruction of things , parodying of things , reference to other work and pop culture and such . A good example is Andy Warhol 's famous Campbell 's Soup Cans . He took an everyday object , and by changing it 's context ( painted , in an art gallery ) , he encouraged people to think about it differently . He took it a step further by making many copies of the painting , making the \" art \" as mass produced as the supposedly \" artless \" can . If all of that sounds a bit like artsy double - speak ... well you would n't be alone in thinking that , but there are definitely some postmodernists who have done interesting things .", "it 's a term that originated in early 20th - century architectural criticism . sees human history / culture / values as a series of ' narratives ' usually in place to maintain some ' hegemony ' or status quo . Basically innate to it is an extreme relativism , coming after ' modernism ' which was the culmination of the Enlightenment , which a postmodernist would characterise as a misguided movement based on the notion that there was such thing as ' truth ' and progress . jargon includes ' narrative ' , ' hegemony ' , ' deconstruction ' , etc . I find * postmodernity * as a subject highly fascinating and postmodern art and architecture interesting , I find postmodernism as a philosophy to be pretty much bankrupt . I read a paper recently enough that said it pretty much relies on very mundane truths from which can be extrapolated exciting fictions ( ie . because something is a construct , it could have been constructed differently - > woo ! nothing means anything ! 2 + 2 = 5 ! ) . Foucalt equated truth with power , which sounds exciting and transgressive , but not everyone will notice that his definition of truth is * completely mundane * . There have been postmodernist academics who literally claimed the laws of physics are cultural conventions , they can only be rank and small - minded people .", "Okay , to understand * Post*modernism , you have to understand Modernism . Modernism was the philosophy of concrete \" there it is\"-ness . This was mainly a reaction to all the chaotic craziness of the early to mid 1800s . This prevailed up until the World Wars , which is when people started to question the concrete - itude of things . It 's all about questioning and not being literal about anything , as a reaction to the horrible failure of what was then viewed as absolute truth . Simply put , it 's a total rejection of what things are / seem to be , and showing that it all can be pulled apart somehow .

Like, you can't have 5 x 5 = 25 because 5 is not a prime number. It's kind of like a math mystery that nobody could solve for a really long time! *intrigued*\n\nSo, Fermat's Last Theorem is like a big challenge to other mathematician's to figure out a way to prove that there are no prime numbers like that.

A * solution * to an equation is a set of number that satisfy that equation . For example , we can look at the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 . If we pick x to be 3 , y to be 4 , and z to be 5 , then we have a solution since x^2 + y^2 = 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5 ^ 2 = z^2 . Notice that our solution — x = 3 , y = 4 , z = 5 — is made of counting numbers ? We can consider a generalization of the above equation , x^n + y^n = z^n , where n is any counting number itself , and ask whether * that * equation has a solution made up entirely of counting numbers . For example , we could look at the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 , or x^10 + y^10 = z^10 . So we 've established that if n is 2 , then there are solutions made up only of counting numbers ( we used 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Fermat 's Last Theorem says that if n is * bigger * than 2 then you ca n't find a solution made up only of counting numbers . If two of the numbers in your solution are counting numbers , then the third one wo n't be a counting number . The known proof of this theorem can not be explained like you 're five .

This is in contrast to the case where n=1 , which is pretty trivial , and the case n=2 , where there are examples like 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 One way to see that this is sort of crazy if true , is to consider it this way : if x^n + y^n = z^n then ( x / z)^n + ( y / z)^n = 1 . Then the theorem comes down to saying there are no pairs ( x , y ) of nonzero rational numbers on the plane curve defined by the equation x^n + y^n = 1 . For n=4 , this curve looks like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . By the FLT that curve slips \" in between \" all the rational number pairs , never hitting them except along the axes . The proof that this is true is one of the most complicated proofs in modern mathematics . It took 7 years for one of the world 's best mathematicians to finish . Any ELI5 description would be hopelessly inadequate . The proof involved taking two fields which were previously thought to be unrelated and showing they are actually the same . Once this was done ( or rather , a part of this , the full thing was done later ) , we can take the FLT and translate it to a problem in this other field , where there exist techniques to tackle it there ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 242.66666666666666}

Donnie has a best friend named Sam who lives next door, and they do lots of fun things together like playing video games and watching movies. But there's something special about Donnie... 😉\n\nYou see, Donnie has a giant teddy bear named Frank who talks to him. Yep, you heard that right! Frank is a really smart teddy bear who can talk, and he's got some pretty wild ideas. 🤪 Frank tells Donnie all sorts of weird and wacky things, like how the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds! 🕰️😱\n\nDonnie starts to think that Frank might be right, and things get really strange. Donnie starts to time travel, and he meets some pretty cool people along the way, like a giant rabbit who can play the piano and a little girl who can make rainbow sandcastles. 🌈🏠🎹\n\nBut things can

Parts of it are available to read online . Near the start of Donnie Darko the universe breaks . A jet engine appears in the sky without a cause , creating a parallel universe ( sort of like an alternate reality , much the same as the one we live in but with slightly different rules ) . Without a cause for the jet engine 's appearance both the universe and parallel universe will end in a month . There are slightly different rules for the parallel universe to our own , mostly involving what people can do . Since Donnie was ' supposed ' to be killed by the jet engine he is given powers , but is unaware of them . The powers give him mastery over water , metal and the creation of portals ( evidenced by him flooding the school , putting an axe in the mascot , and creating a portal at the end ) . Unless he fixes the universe , it will end . Others who are killed in the parallel universe ( Frank and Gretchin ) are aware of the dire situation , and have powers . They are n't able to fix the universe directly , however . For example , Frank uses his power to appear to Donnie . Gretchin does not overtly use powers , instead making Donnie invest emotionally in her so her death is meaningful . Everyone else also has a subconscious awareness of the parallel universe and it 's impending doom , which sometimes affects their actions ( e.g. the psychiatrist acts very out of character when Donnie sees Frank in her office , and one of Donnie 's friends saying \" someone should write [ Roberta Sparrow ] a letter \" ) . So given all this mechanism , we have a plot . Frank saves Donnie . Gretchin makes Donnie like her . Frank brings out Donnie 's power , making him flood the school ( so Donnie and Gretchin meet ) and burn down the paedophiles house ( meaning Miss Farmer ( the bitchy mum ) ca n't take the daughters away , so Donnie 's mum must do it ) . This means Donnie and his sister can have a party so that Frank ( the real one ) goes on a beer run . The supporting characters encourage Donnie to visit Roberta Sparrow ( after the teacher gives him her book ) , so he does . Gretchin dies , which pushes Donnie to send a jet engine back in time , thus giving a cause for the jet engine ( albeit a convoluted one ) . The ending ( him laughing ) leaves it open to interpretation . The characters still have some residual subconscious memory of the event , leading them to feel very emotional .", "Basically Donnie experiences a tangent / alternate universe if he had survived the night of the engine crash . Frank is killed by Donnie in the tangent universe so he becomes a zombie who is trying to unite Donnie with the engine on Halloween night . In the end Donnie goes back 28 days in the past and decided to stay in his room the night of the crash . Consequently Gretchen , Frank and the kiddie porn dude lead completely normal lives with some memories of the tangent universe ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 227.66666666666666}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nHow are paintings and artworks appraised and what makes some contemporary artworks more valuable than another ? Also , can an artist knowingly influence the value of his work ? EDIT : Thanks for your replies . I really learned a lot ! :) Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! Let's talk about how paintings and artworks are appraised. You know how some toys are worth more than others? Well, paintings and artworks are kind of like toys, but instead of being fun to play with, they're fun to look at and appreciate.\n\nAppraisers are like toy inspectors, but instead of looking for broken pieces or missing parts, they check how valuable a painting or artwork is. They look at things like how old it is, who made it, and how special it is. For example, a painting made by a famous artist can be more valuable than one made by someone who isn't so famous.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why some contemporary artworks are more valuable than others. That's like comparing toys from different stores. Some toys might be more rare or special than others, and the same thing goes for paintings and artworks. Some might be more rare or unique than others, and that can make them more valuable.\n\nArtists can definitely influence the value of their work! Think of it like baking a cake. If you put in more effort or use better ingredients, your cake might be more delicious and valuable. Similarly, if an artist puts a lot of time and effort into their work, or if they use special or unique materials, their artwork might be more valuable", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob":

Nothing more , nothing less . Someone who gives an appraisal need only do two things : 1 ) identify the artwork 2 ) have enough knowledge of the current art market to be able to estimate what such an artwork could be sold for . An artist can influence the value of his work by dying . Whilever the artist is alive , there is always the possibility he could make another work very similar to his others , diluting the market . It is very unlikely that a painting by a living artist could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars , because anyone prepared to spend that much could easily give the artist 50 million and he would surely paint another . Once the artist dies there fan be no more works , the supply is finite and so demand can drive up price .", "Much of an artwork 's value is arbitrary , but not always . Size , media , date , edition size , condition , provenance and subject matter are all taken into account when valuing a piece of art , along with the reputation of the artist of course . Past sales results are considered , along with current climate ( how similar artists are faring ) . An artist does not need to die to raise value of their art , and in some cases it can backfire - at least in the short term . Collectors often buy up work of elderly artists , anticipating their death ( a bit macabre , but it 's true ! ) , and then flood the market . Supply exceeds demand & value drops . Artist estates can also be guilty of flooding ( eg , family members sell off large numbers of works left behind in the studio , many of which are of inferior quality ; there 's a reason those paintings did n't sell in 50 years ! ) A sensible dealer or auction house will manage the supply to heighten demand , and build up prices slowly . But you do n't have to die ! Having a major exhibition at a respected institution helps raise value , as does winning awards and participating in group exhibitions . Increasing the profile of the artist increases the price . Growing artistically & reinvention is important , too . Different periods in an artist 's career are often valued differently , which a sense of demand when that artist no longer works in the same style or subject matter . When exhibiting , do n't exhibit too many works at once ; if there are 100 works available , collectors are less inclined to buy at the start of the exhibition , because they know lots will be left over at the end & they 'll be able to get a discount on the price . The more works left unsold , the higher discount a collector will demand & they 'll be more likely to get it . Source : valuing & selling art has been my job for the past decade ... It 's depressingly cynical .", "Living artists become worth more money based on their actual work , if they belong to an emerging movement , and where they 've exhibited . As someone else mentioned though , art value is an extremely fluid concept and is not concrete . It 's only worth what one person is willing to pay . That is why the price can fluctuate so much ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 253.33333333333334}

He makes sure that everyone has enough food to eat and a nice place to live. But, sometimes, the chef might make a mistake and give someone the wrong food. *makes a disappointed face*\n\nThat's what happened with some of the cops.

It's like when you're at a friend's house and you want to play a game, but your friend says no. *pouts*\n\nSo, some of the cops started to feel upset with the mayor and didn't want to work as hard for him.

It just says that racial profiling happens and he had to teach his biracial son that its very important to be careful around police officers and to treat them with respect . In response to that came [ the video of Patrick Lynch ] ( URL_0 ) , the head of the Patrolmen ’s Benevolent Association , a police union . I doubt most of the police who turned their backs on DeBlasio know the words they 're protesting . I bet all of them saw or heard about the \" Blood on his hands \" comment . It just so happens that the Mayor and the [ union are in contract renegotiations for the police force ] ( URL_3 ) - Bloomberg tried to renegotiate , but never settled , and the unions placed the problem on DeBlasio 's lap . The labor unions [ started on the right foot with DeBlasio ] ( URL_1 ) , and [ most of the unions have accepted the new contracts ] ( URL_2 ) , the Police union has not accepted their new contract , although it 's similar to the ones other labor unions have reviewed and accepted ( I ca n't find the link to this part ) ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 223.66666666666666}

That's when you need to get a new one! *nodding*\n\nReplacing your box spring with a new one helps your mattress last longer because it's like giving your mattress a brand new toy to play with.

In fact , you could just as easily use a cut of plywood and some cinder blocks to stabilize your mattress .", "The mattress will last longer because it will be supported properly . The important thing that some people are missing is that you should definitely replace an old box spring with a new one . If you 'd rather use a platform bed , put it directly on the ground , etc . that 's fine . But if you 're going to use a box , use the box designed for your mattress for these reasons : 1 . Boxes are designed to work with the mattress they 're sold with . It 's fairly simple technology , but there have been changes over the past 10 years or so that matter , so do n't use an old one with a new mattress . 2 . Because the box matters , your warranty will usually be voided if you use the wrong box . If your decision to save a little bit of money effects the longevity of the mattress , the manufacturer is n't going to subsidize that decision by honoring the warranty . 3 . Even if your old box is the correct kind and you do n't care about the warranty , the boxes wear down over time . The purpose of a box is to provide an even , supportive foundation for your mattress . It should flex slightly and help distribute pressures exerted on the sleep system . As this happens over time , it performs less well , causing the mattress to be less supported and to deal with more strain overall . 4 . Even if you do n't care that a worn out box might increase the rate at which your mattress wears , a worn out box could break prematurely . As the stresses are applied to the box it will slowly break down . Any day it could hit the critical point and a major component could break . At this point you 'd most likely want to buy a new one . You 'd go find the cheapest one possible . Then in a couple years you 'd replace the mattress again , but not the box , since you \" just \" replaced it . This cycle will continue forever and will cause you to have to make twice as many trips ( and potentially pay for twice as many deliveries ) as otherwise . 5 . The majority of the cost is on the mattress , not the box . If you 're going to pay for the mattress , it 's usually worth it to know that you do n't have to worry about anything for the next 10 years and pay for the box as well .", "That depends on the type of boxspring that you have . Modern mattresses are designed to be placed on a solid foundation . If your current boxspring is a sturdy foundation that does n't flex at all , you might be fine ( though an inspector might disagree if you make a warranty claim . ) If you have an older style boxspring that had actual springs in it , it needs to be replaced because that is n't a solid support . Alternatively you can place the mattress on the floor , a platform bed , or a power foundation .

Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *grin* Oh, you want to know why scientists haven't been able to make a device that lets people breathe underwater like fish do? 😊 Well, you know how fish have this special organ called a gills? They use it to take in oxygen from the water and let out carbon dioxide. It's pretty cool, right? 😍\n\nBut, you know what? Creating a device that can mimic the same thing for people is actually really hard! *exaggerated gasp* You see, scientists have tried lots of different things, but they just can't quite get it right yet. It's kind of like trying to build a machine that can turn invisible – it's just not possible, you know? 😳\n\nOne reason it's so hard is because fish gills are super specialized. They're made out of tiny little filaments that are really good at taking in oxygen from the water, but they're not good at taking in air from the air. It's like they're picky eaters! 🤣 So, scientists have to figure out a way to make a device that can mimic those tiny little filaments and let in the right stuff – like oxygen – but not let in the

It 's called a [ snorkeling mask ] ( URL_0 ) . ;) ( completely tongue in cheek , this does n't actually do what you want ) . The real reason is because the oxygen concentration ( partial pressure ) in the water is much lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in the air . Therefore , it 's very difficult to concentrate it to levels that humans can safely breathe ( we need a lot more oxygen than fish do , just because we 're air adapted not water adapted ) . Getting any solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration is difficult . It can be done with something that binds oxygen very tightly , but then how to release the oxygen so it can be breathed in ? Also , getting the total pressure of the air correct so that it can be breathed properly would be difficult . There is even less nitrogen in the water than oxygen . Therefore , even if you could get enough oxygen it would be less than one atmosphere , maybe even less than one fifth of one atmosphere , in pressure , so it would be very difficult to breathe .", "The gills essentially have oxygen flow right into the bloodstream . this would be incredibly difficult to reproduce technologically as it would require direct access to the bloodstream while underwater as well and the chance that if a single leak appeared , you could very quickly die . However , what is more plausible is a machine which takes oxygen out of the water and we then breathe that . Some people have tried this in the triton , however it has many downsides , the largest is that ( even if it does work as claimed , I have n't seen proper tests ) [ it is almost physically impossible to extract air quick enough for an active organism like a mammal ] ( URL_0 ) ( why do whales and dolphins not develop gills ? ) . It is an interesting idea and I am sure it will be solved someday but for now , there are no obvious solutions to such a complex process . As the others said , biological solutions are nowhere close and mechanical solutions still require years or decades of development .", "Fish and humans are very different . Rewiring a human in this manor is well outside the abilities of current science . We can barely put ourselves back together again after we get hurt . The first lung transplants were not that long ago and they came from another living human . We can not currently grow a set of human lungs ( from scratch ) and insert them into a living human . So we are quite far away from growing some human but still air breathing style lungs and inserting them into humans . Let alone modifying those lungs to a new design . You are effectively asking . Why are we not at step 1020 of medical science . The response is that we are currently at step 3 , so we have quite a way to go before we get to 1020 ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 254.33333333333334}

It's like a messenger between you and the websites and games you want to play! *awesome smile*\n\nYou see, when you want to play a game or visit a website, your computer needs to know how to find it on the internet. It does this by using special numbers called \"ports.\" *nod* Think of ports like a address on a map – they help your computer find the place you want to go!\n\nBut sometimes, the websites and games you want to play use different ports than what your computer is expecting. That's where port forwarding comes in! *cool smile* It's like a special trick that lets your computer use different ports to find the place you want to go.

Port forwarding forwards the mail from mailbox X to mailbox Y. Think of ports as mailboxes . Let 's say you wanted to hand deliver a letter to Joe at the Acme Brick company . You would go to the address of the Acme Brick Company . The company employs 5,000 people . So you would see a grid of boxes with people 's names on them . You find the one that belongs to Joe and you put the letter in there . This is kind of how computer 's talk to each other . The street address is the IP address of the computer ( say 192.168.1.1 ) and the grid of mailboxes is the port . If you want to talk to a computer via http , you would send your information and requests to port 80 . If you wanted to talk to them with a different protocol like RDP , you would talk to 3389 . If you wanted to talk to the SMTP service on that computer , you 'd talk to port 25 . You are going to that computer and putting your correspondence in a particular mailbox ( port ) . Now , let 's say that Joe is a secret agent who works for the Acme Brick Company . To you , he 's known as Joe . To everyone inside the company , he 's known as Bob . This identity may be so super - secret that Bob does n't even know what name you know him by . You just know him as Joe . You want to talk to Joe so you go to the Acme Brick Company , you find their grid of mailboxes and you put your letter in Joe 's mailbox . Some poor mail clerk on the other side ( your router ) know 's Joe 's secret identity . So he takes the mail from Joe 's box and put 's it in Bob 's mailbox . This way Bob can pick it up .

Now , if you have a router , if that other computer tries to connect to you , the IP address it reaches will be assigned to the router . Now that router will know all computers in the local home network ( eg your desktop , your laptop , your iPad etc ) , but which of those is the incoming request for ? That is what you tell it by enabling port forwarding .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question within 300 words:\n\nPro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five.[/INST]", "pred": " Hey there, little buddy! *adjusts glasses* Let's talk about why there's so much controversy in America about whether people should support or oppose unions.\n\nSo, you know how there are big companies and corporations that have a lot of power and money? They make decisions that affect a lot of people, like how much they get paid and what their work hours are. But, sometimes these big companies don't always do what's fair or best for their employees. That's where unions come in!\n\nA union is like a group of friends who stand up together and ask the big companies to be more fair. They make sure that the employees get treated right and have safe working conditions. They also help employees negotiate with the big companies for better wages and benefits. It's like they're saying, \"Hey, we're all in this together, and we deserve to be treated with respect!\"\n\nNow, some people might say that unions are bad because they make the big companies have to share their power and money with the employees. They might think that the employees shouldn't have to pay to be in a union, or that the unions are just a bunch of trouble. But, the thing is, without unions, a lot of workers wouldn't have the same rights and protections that they do today!\n\nFor example, in", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

We produce a larger quantity and higher quality product as well because we do n't have senseless union red tape that allows us to perform our jobs efficiently . For instance if my line is down because of an electric motor and there are 4 bolts that mount it to the floor . I can do whatever it takes to compete the task . In a union shop I would have to wait for an available mechanic to remove any bolts or fasteners so that I could remove the wires . If I were to do it myself to get it back running and make the company more profitable I would be fined or fired for taking work from another worker 's \" craft \" and violating the union contract .", "A union is essentially a representative that sits between you and your employer when it comes to matters such as hiring ( workplace agreements and wages ) , termination ( fair dismissal , severance ) , strikes and so on . For workers unions are usually a good thing , because the union represents a large number of people in an industry they 're in a good position to negotiate better wages and working conditions than any individual would be able to get . The union will also represent you in workplace disputes , and can sometimes provide legal representation . Unions do have some downsides . For example if there are non - unioned workers in an industry it effectively weakens the union 's position ( why would an employer agree to the union 's demands when they can just hire non - union people instead ) . Therefore in some industries there is a lot of pressure on workers to join unions . If you look around you 'll find stories of strong - arm tactics or even open hostility . Employers also find unions difficult to work with . An employer needs to consider the financial situation of their company when considering things like wages , the union does n't have the same concern and so could make demands greater than the employer can cover , if the employer does n't meet the demands or negotiate them down then they risk their staff going on strike . The pro - union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages , and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay , therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 230.0}

Last year, a man named Michael Brown was killed by a police officer. It was a very big deal, and a lot of people were upset about it.\n\nYou see, Michael Brown was a black man, and the police officer who shot him is white. That means that Michael Brown was a different color than the officer. Some people might think that this made a difference in how the police treated him. They might think that Michael Brown was treated unfairly because he was black.\n\nIt's important to understand that every person is special and should be treated with respect, no matter what color they are. Everyone deserves to be safe and happy, and it's not okay for people to be mean to each other just because they're different.\n\nThat's why a lot of people in the United States are talking about what happened to Michael Brown and why it's important to be fair and kind to everyone, no matter what color they are. It's a big issue because it affects how people feel and how they're treated, and it's important to make sure that everyone is treated equally and with respect.\n\nSo, Ferguson is an issue of race

Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to have different ideas about how things should be run.\n\nSo, in politics, just like how kids play different games, different groups of people might have different ideas about how the world should be run.

They believe that government should be limited as to not interfere with the rights of the citizens . Also , interfering with the economy will slow it down because of all the restrictions and taxes imposed on it . On the other hand , the left says that the role of government should be to help all of the people directly . To the very extreme , this would be a communist society , in which the government provides everything for everybody . They see it as the role of the government to help those in need and redistribute wealth so that everyone is happy .

An Arduino is a small device called a micro - controller that is like a very small computer that allows programs to talk to and control other devices that do things like move stuff or measure things . Examples of things it could control : Motors , Levers , Lights , Speakers . It can talk to other things too , like : sensors such as thermometers , light meters , cameras and so on . The programs that do the thinking for the Arduino are created on a personal computer , and then generally stored on memory attached to the Arduino . If you want to make a program physically move something or interact with something , chances are you want to use a micro - controller like the Arduino . You could use an Arduino to make a small robot like a car . Or you could use it to make a spy sensor for your bedroom door . Or if you really wanted to get crazy you could make a robotic nerf gun turret to shoot your sister when she gets into your stuff . EDIT : tchebb is correct , Arduinos have onboard memory , and do n't use memory cards .", "An Arduino is essentially an Atmel AtMega microcontroller , most commonly the AtMega328 , with all the components to make it work on a single board . The AtMega328 is like a little computer , it has RAM , ROM , a CPU . It also has pins , 28 of them , which you can connect to just about anything and either get information , or put out information . The pins are connected to little holes that you can stick wires in and connect to things . Because the holes are almost always in the same place on an Arduino , people make other boards to place on top that will allow the basic Arduino to do other things , like play music or connect to the internet . There are a lot of things that attract people to the Arduino , one being that it 's well - known and has many many tutorials created for it . Another being that it is very easy to program , there is no need for extra hardware to burn programs to the microcontroller - you simply plug it in with USB and use the Arduino development environment to send the program over . The Arduino IDE and programming language is another selling point for the Arduino . It comes with many example programs that you can view and modify to do just about anything . The programming language itself is called Wiring , which is very similar to URL_0 , which itself has similarities to Java . And finally the price point , you can easily build your own for as little as $ 5 , or you can buy one pre - made for about $ 25 . Arduino and arduino - like boards are a great entry to microcontroller projects .", "An Arduino is a simple cheap computer , that has a lot of space and support to hook up electronic inputs and outputs . This provides a standardized way to use this component as an electronic brain for the rest of your electronics projects . While there are other components that can do this , an Arduino has been designed specifically for this purpose , so it makes it easy to do these things ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 234.33333333333334}

Now sometimes that car changes lanes , speeds up , and then gets back in to the lane we 're driving in . In order to do that , that car needs to cover a larger amount of distance than us in the same amount of time . We call this \" acceleration \" . Usually the car that passes us on the freeway returns to the speed it was going before it changed lanes . But what if it did n't ? It would keep going faster and faster . It would also cover more distance than us in the same amount of time . That car has a limit on how fast it can go though , which means it has a limit on how much distance it can cover within a certain amount of time . But what if it did n't ? That car could keep getting faster and faster ! It could cover more and more distance within a certain amount of time ! That 's how the universe works , but in all directions .

They are like Wonder Woman, fighting cancer with their brains and their hearts! 💪\n\nNow, about your chances of survival. It's important to know that every person is different, and it depends on what kind of cancer they have and how bad it is. But the good news is that lots of people are surviving cancer! Some people even go on to live long and happy lives after they beat it. It's like they have their own superpowers! 😊\n\nBut, *adjusts glasses again*, we still haven't found a way to cure cancer yet.

This can occur anywhere . The main problem is that cancer does not consist of other ( so called ' foreign ' ) cells , like bacteria , but of your own . Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt ) . Easier to reach = better prognosis . Malignant means that some of the cancer cells have breached the little layer on top , or that the layer is not in place . These cells can then travel through the lymphatic system into your blood and spread elsewhere through your body . They can then form a new tumor there . This is called metastasis , and severely curbs the prognosis . The xkcd comic is about malignant forms of cancer , because , like Randall said , there is indeed no way to make sure that there are no cancer cells left in the body . Until 6 months later , when there is either a new ( small ) tumor or not . Benignent cancer , is not that bad . It can be treated , and after treatment the only problem can be that it returns- because you are more sensitive towards cancer if you have had it once . The 10 - year survival rate is actually 50 % , not 60 . It differs per form of cancer- colon cancer is one of the worst .", "Cancer is when extra cells grow in your body , and they are n't the right kind of cells . People often say \" cancer \" like its some big scary all - encompassing monster . The reality is that when someone tells you that they have \" cancer , \" they have a specific kind with a fancy medical name based on where it is on their body and what kind of extra cells are growing there . Different kinds of bad cells are worse than others , or are harder to treat because of where they are located . This is why some cancers , like pancreatic cancer , are considered death sentences , and others , like leukemia , are considered very treatable .", "How does it cause all the symptoms ( fatigue , non - healing sores , weight loss , etc . ) and how does it actually kill you ?

Well, some people in the US (not all, but some) might feel like their government is not doing a great job of taking care of them and their community. They might feel like they're working hard and paying taxes (like ants gathering food), but they're not getting enough in return. It's like their government is not sharing the wealth (food) equally among everyone.\n\nCanada is a bit like a different colony, you know? *winks* Their government has different rules and laws that help ensure people have access to things like healthcare, education, and other services. It's like they have a different \"ant hill\" with a different way of doing things! 🏠 And just like how ants have to work together to make their colony strong, some people in the US and Canada might feel like their governments need to work better together to make sure everyone has what they need.\n\nBut, you know what? *giggles* Even though some grown-ups might not agree on things, it's important

years ago ) from public school curricula were civics and critical thinking skills , leaving students inundated with cultural norms derived from profit - driven , entertainment - centered media -- and this all happened during a series of economic bubbles that inflated personal expectations of material reward far beyond reality . During that same period , unions were under direct attack from the corporate - funded political right . Many Americans under 40 seem to have almost no concept of common good , let alone how their own government is supposed to work . And all Americans , old and young , have been bombarded with corporate - sponsored anti - tax , anti - federal scapegoating that only seems to be spontaneous grassroots sentiment -- it 's all Astroturf , but few have been able to see that until now . The internet , esp . conversational media , are making some headway in fixing this , but changing the paradigm will be a long , hard slog . This is n't exactly LI5 , but it 's a huge question .", "Because they have slowly been conditioned over the past two hundred years to believe that whatever benefits corporations and the extremely rich will benefit themselves as well . This conditioning has been paid for by corporations and the extremely rich .", "I think part of it is a regional issue , part of it is a historical issue , and part of it is a ideological issue . When you look at the US today , the region with the strongest anti - tax , anti - government is generally considered the Deep South , whereas regions like the Northeast and Pacific Coast and generally fairly tolerant of both . I 've read that one reason this delineation exists goes back to the Civil War . After the Civil War ended , the USA was faced with tremendous debts from having waged it . What the USA did in order to pay for it ( as is a common practice ) is they made the losers of the war pay for it . This amounted to taxing the South into the ground . If you view from a certain perspective , the mindset makes a certain amount of sense . The USA government viewed an accepted practice of the South ( slavery ) as unacceptable and demanded they stop . When the South declined to do so , and chose to break away from the USA instead , the USA went to war with the South and kicked its collective ass . Then , after the USA defeated the South , the South was forced to pay for the ass - whooping it had received . Not hard to see why people could be bitter about that . As to why that mindset has lasted in that region to this day , I do n't have a spectacular answer short of parents bringing up their kids in that mindset . I view it as something akin to choosing a sports team . If you 're a boy and your dad is a Red Sox fan , odds are you 're going to root for the Red Sox , and similarly with the Yankees . And if you 're brought up with your parents pointing out every injustice the government acts against you , odds are good you 're going to start noticing them as well ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 251.33333333333334}

Let me tell you a cool secret about how we can make our files smaller without losing any important information! 😱\n\nYou know how some animals, like tortoises, can shrink their bodies down really small to fit into tiny spaces? Well, computer scientists have found a way to do something similar with data! 🐢\n\nWhen we compress data, like a big ol' file filled with pictures and videos, we're using special tools called \"compression algorithms.\" These algorithms take the data and shrink it down into something smaller, like a tiny little Zip file! 💪\n\nHere's the best part: when we compress data, we're not getting rid of any of the information inside the file! 🤯 It's like we're using a special kind of bookshelf that can fit all the books from a huge library onto a tiny little shelf. The books might be smaller, but they're still the same books! 📚\n\nSo, how do these algorithms do it? They use math tricks to figure out which parts of the data are the most important, and they only save those parts. The rest of the data, like the really tiny details, they throw away because they're not important for the file to be smaller! 🤔\n\nFor example,", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0},

There are two types of compression - lossless ( like ZIP files and RARs and so forth ) and lossy ( JPEG , MPEG , etc ) . Lossless compression uses tricks ( like run - length encoding , which people have mentioned ) to represent the same information with fewer bits . It boils down to the fact that information in an easy to use format is generally pretty verbose . Compression trades \" easy to use \" for \" easy to store . \" Smarter lossless compressors might take into account patterns in the data . For instance , a lossless compressor for English text files would probably want to take into account the frequency of various letters - we use a lot of \" e\"s and not that many \" z\"s . Lossy compression takes this a step further by incorporating the understanding of * how the data will be used * - it generally takes into account that the information will be used by humans . For instance , to compress a picture into a JPEG , you usually throw away a lot of the data corresponding to the color information in the photo . Our eyes are much better at picking up the differences between levels of gray than we are the different colors . Then we apply a variety of techniques to the data to represent it in a compact format . Similarly , audio compression favors frequencies in the source audio that our ears are better at hearing . One odd side effect of this is that other animals ( or aliens or whatever ) would probably look at a raw image and a JPEG and see significant differences , whereas we ca n't really perceive the difference as much .", "Let 's just do a very simple , not particularly great compression algorithm . I have a string of the letters ' A ' and ' B ' and for some reason , they tend to clump up an awful lot so I get a bunch of ' A 's in a row then a bunch of ' B 's in a row . In its raw form , I could just save the string . AAAABBBAABAAAAAAABBBAABBBBBBAAAAABBBAABBBAAAAA I , however , want to save a bit of space , so I will store it in a compressed format . In this compression , I will have a number from 1 - 8 followed by a letter and this represents how many times I need to repeat that letter . 4A3B2A1B7A3B2A6B5A3B2A3B5A This new string is much smaller , but I can follow my rules to reproduce the original one without any loss ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 239.66666666666666}

Let me tell you a magical story about how programming languages can control machines. Are you ready? 😃\n\nSo, you know how you can tell your toy robot to move around, or make it do different things? Well, a programming language is like a special set of instructions that tells a machine, like a computer or a robot, what to do. It's like giving your toy robot a set of instructions on how to play a game, or how to do a cool trick! 🤖\n\nHere's the magical part: when you write instructions in a programming language, like a game developer creating a video game, you're actually giving the machine a set of commands that it can understand. These commands are like a blueprint that the machine follows to do what you want it to do. It's like giving your toy robot a set of steps to follow, and it will do them for you! 🏋️‍♀️\n\nFor example, you could write instructions in a programming language that make your toy robot move forward, turn left, and pick up a toy. The machine will follow the instructions one by one, just like a robot doing a dance! 🕺\n\nBut how does the machine actually understand what you're telling it to do?

Let 's say you have someone who 's a really smart professor ( the processor ) and you want him to help you with a problem . The only thing is that this professor only speaks Russian ( binary or machine code ) . So you get someone who knows Russian but he can only translate that into Spanish ( assembly ) . Now let 's say you know some Spanish , but communicating with the translator that way is just annoying . So you finally get a friend to translate from Spanish to English ( programming languages like C or C++ ) . Basically when programming in a programming language they get translated to harder and harder to understand languages until it gets to just 1 's and 0 's . From there the CPU can then send 1 's or 0 's to other physical parts of the computer ( i.e. the professor can talk to his Russian speaking colleagues who know more about other subjects ) . Technically you could use a English to Russian dictionary to talk to the professor or even learn Russian , but it 's hard to do that and takes time . As a side note though , some people prefer going directly from English to Russian because using a string of translators blurs the lines , and things get mixed up ( i.e. if you code in assembly language , the first step above 1 's and 0 's , you have more direct control over what the computer does compared to C ) . As for data to physical action , a hard drive just might be programmed to see \" 001001010 \" to \" write this here \" .

You write programs , which tumble down to very , very basic information at a very , very specific part of a machine . That part of the machine then does something which causes a chain reaction which ultimately ends in a physical change you can notice . If someone writes some code in what we call a programming language ( e.g. Java , C , Perl , etc . ) , a special program called a compiler takes that code and eventually changes it into a series of 1 's and 0 's . This information is further split into smaller and smaller packets of data until it eventually arrives at a certain component that can read that string of 1s and 0s and generally perform a basic physical action ( e.g. change the voltage on a wire , or change the charge on a metal disk ) . This action again causes a chain reaction in the other direction , until it finally arrives at the physical change you can actually notice .", "In simple terms , that text command , and the code behind it that runs it is represented inside the computer by electrical signals . To convert those electrical signals into physical action , you simply need to amplify them and then use them to drive things like motors , solenoids , valves , linear actuators , and other devices that are operated electrically ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 249.33333333333334}

It's kind of like a big playground where everyone can play and have fun without anyone bossing them around! 😊\n\nPeople who like libertarianism, called libertarians, think that the government should only do things that are really important, like protecting us from bad people and keeping the peace. They don't want the government to tell them what to do or how to live their lives. They believe that individuals can make better choices than the government can, and they want to be able to make their own decisions and live their lives as they see fit. 🤔\n\nA libertarian society would be like a really cool neighborhood where everyone can be themselves and do what makes them happy, without worrying about the government getting in the way. It would be a place where people can be free to start their own businesses, create their own jobs, and live their lives as they see fit. It would be a very inclusive place where everyone can be a part of the community and contribute their own way! 🏡\n\nSo, in summary, libertarianism is a political idea that says individuals should be

Basically I have the power to swing my arms as much as I want , but my rights to do that stop at the edge of your nose . At that point it would be encroaching upon your rights .", "The volunteer at the bookstore either does n't really understand libertarianism or they are intentionally mischaracterizing it ( most likely the second because anarchists tend to dislike anything governmental ) . Now , first off , let me say that the idea of libertarianism has been co - opted by groups such as The Tea Party who are n't really interested in the ideals of libertarianism so much as they 're interested in how they can use some less - diligent followers of libertarianism for their own gain . For instance , The Tea Party tends to be accurately libertarian when it comes to fiscal - in - the - government issues , but absolutely not very libertarian at all when it comes to social - in - the - government issues . So they want to use the libertarian platform to push their own social agenda ( which tends toward conservatism ) . Actual libertarianism , as anon33249038 stated , is about recognizing people 's rights and the freedom for individuals to choose their actions as long as they 're not encroaching on anyone else 's rights . A good example of this might be drug use ... as long as the individual 's drug use does n't impact someone else 's rights , it is considered a \" victimless crime \" and should not be illegal . Once that drug use begins to encroach on someone else 's rights , there is now a victim , and that victim 's rights should be upheld .", "You might want to read through the answers that have been given the last dozen times someone asked this question . Essentially , libertarians take the position that the less government there is , and the less it does , the better . How much government that is , and how much it runs , varies from one school of thought to another . Anarcho - capitalism is sort of the far end of the spectrum , whose proponents believe the state can be done away with altogether and replaced by private businesses . There 's a lot of debate about how exactly a libertarian society would work . Non - libertarians would likely think it would n't work at all . Frequently , people who are into libertarianism * are * relatively well off and politically conservative . If you 're relying on welfare to make ends meet , or you 're a low - wage employee being screwed over by some big company , chances are that the idea of abolishing government and leaving everything to the market is n't going to appeal to you , whereas for people who are well off , the idea of getting rid of almost all taxes is pretty appealing and you get the vague notion that everything will run better without government as a bonus . With regards to ' socialism for rich people ' , there are a lot of different ways that could be interpreted - \" pie - in - the - sky idea that sounds great on paper but ultimately would n't work \" seems at least possible ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 247.0}

["The simplest answer I believe is how life can not be grown in a test tube . When something is cloned , it has its DNA put into a female of the same species . Because there are no T - Rexs walking around , there is no way to replicate one . OR : Scientists saw the movie and realized there would be dire consequences .", "There was a project at one time to bring back the Mammoth , Jurassic Park style , and there are still scientists working on the idea . I believe the theory was sound though , it went something like this : 1 . Find a frozen male mammoth in the permafrost near the north pole . This part is doable , lots of frozen specimens have already been found . 2 . Extract a viable sperm from this frozen sample . This bit is problematic , because DNA is quite fragile , even if it 's been frozen . 3 . Fertilise the egg of a modern asian elephant with this sperm , and implant the zygote ( fertilised egg ) into the female elephant . 4 . If all goes well , you have a half - mammoth , half - elephant hybrid . Hope for a girl . 5 . Now get another frozen mammoth sperm , and impregnate the hybrid as you did her mother . This should give you a creature which is 3 - quarters mammoth . 6 . Keep repeating this process until you have something which is as near to being a mammoth as makes no odds . Of course , the lack of viable frozen mammoth sperm makes this a lot harder than it sounds ( well , also all the really hard things . ) It might be possible to recover some intact DNA from the mammoth brain however , and then implant it into an elephant egg - in other words , cloning . This is the approach currently being pursued , by some Japanese scientists .", "Theoretically if we had a complete enough strand of their DNA ( not just one , we need multiple ) we could . There are many problems to overcome though , first , what do you put the DNA in ? When we clone something like a sheep , we take the cloned dna and implant it into a female sheep embryo . I believe in JP they used crocodiles and frogs for their embryos , this could theoretically work , but I do n't know enough about the specifics to comment much more on it . I would say the odds are highly against creating an organism which is healthy . IThe first cloned sheep Dolly was something like the 23rd attempt for that DNA . Genetics has improved since then but there is still * a lot * to learn . The problem is finding DNA which is intact . We have pieces but it is n't enough . DNA is subject to break down , this is why sunlight can give you cancer . The UV / gamma rays are literally striking the DNA strand and destroying a part of it . Skin , organs , really any kind of tissue has an incredibly hard time surviving 200 million years of geology . Even if our technology perfects cloning and genetics , we 'd still need copies of the dino dna and this will be incredibly difficult ."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 218.0}
