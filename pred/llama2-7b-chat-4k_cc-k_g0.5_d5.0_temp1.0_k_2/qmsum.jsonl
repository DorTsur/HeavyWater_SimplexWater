Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-h\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the design of the remote control and identified several issues with the current designs. They suggested that the new remote control should be designed with a more user-friendly interface, with larger buttons and a more intuitive layout. Additionally, they recommended including features such as voice control and the ability to control multiple devices with a single remote. The team also discussed the importance of considering the needs of users with disabilities and how to incorporate universal design principles into the new remote control.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "team", "logprob": -0.10398171097040176}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": -0.8347534537315369}, {"text": "identified", "logprob": -0.17593497037887573}, {"text": "several", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "issues", "logprob": -0.15121398866176605}, {"text": "with", "logprob": -0.22541262209415436}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.7877427935600281}, {"text": "current", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "designs", "logprob": -0.17470479011535645}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "They", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "suggested", "logprob": -0.19354236125946045}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "new", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "should", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "be", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "designed", "logprob": -1.224023699760437}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": -0.13070476055145264}, {"text": "more", "logprob": -1.857227087020874}, {"text": "user", "logprob": -0.5482564568519592}, {"text": "-", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "friend", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ly", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "interface", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "larger", "logprob": -0.6600814461708069}, {"text": "buttons", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "more", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "intuit", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ive", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "layout", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Additionally", "logprob": -0.29683318734169006}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "recommended", "logprob": -0.5069381594657898}, {"text": "including", "logprob": -0.28500229120254517}, {"text": "features", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "such", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "as", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "voice", "logprob": -0.23505128920078278}, {"text": "control", "logprob": -0.12794791162014008}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.1602240949869156}, {"text": "ability", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": -0.5567618012428284}, {"text": "multiple", "logprob": -0.20068444311618805}, {"text": "devices", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": -0.12406735122203827}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "single", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "The", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "team", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "also", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "importance", "logprob": -0.28272321820259094}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "considering", "logprob": -0.8030768036842346}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "needs", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "users", "logprob": -2.321978807449341}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "dis", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "abilities", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "how", "logprob": -2.000124216079712}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "incorpor", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ate", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "universal", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "principles", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "into", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "new", "logprob": -0.0930151715874672}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": -0.3577406704425812}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["The industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source, an interface which included some pressing buttons and keys, a processor, some infrared source which could send the information to the main device, and different encryption codes for different TVs.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have towe could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the possibility of using a touch screen on the remote control, but they were limited by the budget.

Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ?

Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is al: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the general discussion?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " The general discussion during the meeting centered around the issue of overlapping talk in speech recognition recordings and possible solutions, including the use of echo cancellation and spectroanalysis.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the Project Manager's perspective on the prototype.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the Project Manager seems to be neutral or indifferent towards the prototype presented by the Industrial Designer and User Interface.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor Cconsulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What demos would the

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and recordunpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did C think about setting up the recording equipment?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Professor C thought it was a good idea to set up the recording equipment for the meeting.

Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal ., I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about MSG?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, the professor did not explicitly mention or provide any thoughts on MSG.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the Marketing person expressed that they don't think there needs to be many buttons on the remote control, as most people only use a small portion of the features on their TV remote controls.

So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disf, I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about clustering?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the professor seemed to be neutral or non-committal about clustering.

What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for thatto play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ?

Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hvocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group discuss about speech recognition?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the possibility of implementing speech recognition technology in the remote control.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveimpact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What were the two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas are:\n\n1.

Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nInder . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ?

And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkergood sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for thatfilters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about echoes and reverberation?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, the professor did not mention anything about echoes and reverberation.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite u}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys .

She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers\nPhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?\nPhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: For IBM , yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .\nPhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM\nGrad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: No , no .\nPhD F: Oh no no .\nGrad A: We haven't done that process .\nPhD D: no ?\nPhD F: No .

But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .\nGrad A: Yep , sounds familiar .\nPhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .\nPhD D: It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .} were training {pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group think about Dave leaving?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it seems that the group did not have much to say about Dave leaving.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mmight like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group discuss about the trend of teacher recruiting and the reasons for it, and steps they had taken?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the trend of teacher recruitment and retention in Wales and the reasons for it, including a lack of financial incentives, a perception that teaching is not a prestigious profession, and the impact of employment-based routes to qualified teacher status.

To solve this problem, they had taken several steps including making sure their ITE provision was world class, embarking on the first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, etc. In this process, Llyr Gruffydd had a doubt that the level of ambition did not reflect the level of action that was needed actually.

And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .\nPostdoc B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?\nPhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing .\nPostdoc B: I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}\nGrad G: No .\nPostdoc B: I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?\nGrad G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nGrad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .\nProfessor E: And start by giving the transcript number .\nPhD A: Tran\nPhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .\nPhD A: Oh sorry , go ahead .\nProfessor E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .\nGrad H: OK .\nProfessor E: It 's just uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H: Umh .\nProfessor E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .\nGrad G: And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some\nGrad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: like some other noise .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel theythan we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: OK .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was said on speech overlap?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, there was a discussion about speech overlap, specifically in relation to the work that Grad G has been doing.

Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alwe could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits .

So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , here we have our prototype model .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you have some slides then ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes , and place some slides .\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Him .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .\nIndustrial Designer: Experience . Explanat\nUser Interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device .\nMarketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So you can touch it with your hands .\nMarketing: Can I ?\nUser Interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N\nMarketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing: I will uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} One day .\nMarketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .\nMarketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons .\nMarketing: It's in option . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Well , project evaluation .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Maybe a lack of leadership ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: M maybe not , huh ?\nMarketing: Team-work , very strong , I would say .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , our team-work is really strong .\nMarketing: Team-work , no problem . Means . Whiteboard , digital pens .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , we still {gap} , I guess .\nUser Interface: What was the {disfmarker} Oh yeah , what was good ? Everything . What was bad ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think white-board is useful . Digital pens , useful .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: New ideas found ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , you say , is there sheep ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Luck . {vocalsound} Okay . So luck , but good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Which imply good uh team performance .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: {gap} {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but uh then I I mus That's true . And there's uh one very important point .\nIndustrial Designer: Don't really .\nMarketing: We're on time .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And we also {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Meetings finish when they have to or even before .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . We made {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The {disfmarker} for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing .\nUser Interface: Of course . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Not to waste time , that's important .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah , we have other {vocalsound} uh remote controls to create . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We need time f\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .\nProject Manager: A lot of uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: New materials .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm , yeah . Hey ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And new tricks . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: just wondering if my uh {disfmarker} what about the the pink {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the pinkness of that uh\nProject Manager: Mm . Mm . They're working on um pink titanium . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} . They are working on a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah , very {gap} .\nMarketing: Okay , good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Budget .\nMarketing: I think we are great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: There's no no other words for that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We are probably the best .\nUser Interface: Alright .\nProject Manager: Mm yeah . Yeah ,\nMarketing: Real Reaction is uh\nProject Manager: we're really nice .\nMarketing: {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Finished ?\nProject Manager: I think it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ah , celebration . Are the costs within the budget ?\nProject Manager: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Of course they are . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} How {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Is the project evaluated ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: Yes , it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: We got two {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , we see , we can even forecast . {gap} they propose us like celebration , everything ,\nIndustrial Designer: Good score .\nUser Interface: we could forecast it , right ?\nMarketing: To whom ? To the whole our company ?\nProject Manager: I'm the one , {vocalsound} proposing the celebration .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Of course ,\nUser Interface: You ?

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for fustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about project finance.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the project's financial criteria and evaluated the costs to ensure they were within budget.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have toor a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Industrial Design agree with the Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Industrial Designer agreed with Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design because they both acknowledged that they would be presenting again, much like in the last meeting, and would need to come to some final decisions on what they were going to do for the prototype.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Indust", "logprob": -0.347802072763443}, {"text": "rial", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Design", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "er", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "agreed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mark", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "eting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "when", "logprob": -0.2871190309524536}, {"text": "discuss", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ing", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "their", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "present", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ations", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "appearance", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "because", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "both", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "acknowled", "logprob": -0.34828200936317444}, {"text": "ged", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": -0.1625528186559677}, {"text": "would", "logprob": -0.4341760277748108}, {"text": "be", "logprob": -0.7974338531494141}, {"text": "present", "logprob": -0.604872465133667}, {"text": "ing", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "again", "logprob": -0.8998088836669922}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.07291269302368164}, {"text": "much", "logprob": -0.1581316888332367}, {"text": "like", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "in", "logprob": -0.1579262912273407}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "last", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "would", "logprob": -0.17719081044197083}, {"text": "need", "logprob": -0.08377019315958023}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "come", "logprob": -0.13458658754825592}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "some", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "final", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "dec", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "isions", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "what", "logprob": -0.20502635836601257}, {"text": "they", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "were", "logprob": -0.3672420084476471}, {"text": "going", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "do", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "prototype", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["While discussing their presentations on the appearance design, both the Industrial Design and the Marketing put forward to use rubber as the material rather than other things like wood.

This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for fa fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Project Manager agree with Marketing when assessing the criteria of matching the operating behaviour of the user?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, Project Manager agreed with Marketing that the remote control design meets the operating behavior criteria of the user because the design includes a flip-open mechanism that allows for easy use and operation, which aligns with the user's needs and preferences.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Based", "logprob": -0.24386024475097656}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provided", "logprob": -1.351670503616333}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Project", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Manager", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "agreed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mark", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "eting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": -1.8565478324890137}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": -2.280069589614868}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meets", "logprob": -0.9767099618911743}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "operating", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "behavior", "logprob": -1.0853652954101562}, {"text": "criteria", "logprob": -1.550844430923462}, {"text": "of", "logprob": -0.2162599414587021}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "user", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "because", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.08129486441612244}, {"text": "design", "logprob": -0.6399543285369873}, {"text": "includes", "logprob": -0.8612462878227234}, {"text": "a", "logprob": -0.39191046357154846}, {"text": "f", "logprob": -0.2581184506416321}, {"text": "lip", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "-", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "open", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "mechanism", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": -0.568622887134552}, {"text": "allows", "logprob": -0.1625528186559677}, {"text": "for", "logprob": -1.0741660594940186}, {"text": "easy", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "use", "logprob": -0.7306286692619324}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "operation", "logprob": -3.3277904987335205}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.3613939881324768}, {"text": "which", "logprob": -1.3965787887573242}, {"text": "align", "logprob": -0.13857576251029968}, {"text": "s", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "user", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "'", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "s", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "needs", "logprob": -0.06685788929462433}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "prefer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ences", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": -0.10322872549295425}], "answers": ["Industrial Designer mentioned that they were considering that the remote was more for right-handed people than for left-handed people.

Very interesting .\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Large .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Bye bye .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Marketing talk about market trend findings?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Marketing discussed market trend findings, specifically that younger people prefer soft mat materials and primary colors, like totally yellow, totally red, and the cheapest way to achieve this is through the use of rubber around the hand shape and hard plastic for the shape, and around it, hard rubber, and the hand shape is also rubber.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": -1.3539689779281616}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mark", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "eting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": -0.09163712710142136}, {"text": "market", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "tr", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "end", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "find", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ings", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.27569717168807983}, {"text": "specifically", "logprob": -0.14402827620506287}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "younger", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "people", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "prefer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "soft", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "mat", "logprob": -0.6533128023147583}, {"text": "materials", "logprob": -0.45663726329803467}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "primary", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "colors", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "like", "logprob": -1.4146367311477661}, {"text": "totally", "logprob": -0.18371586501598358}, {"text": "yellow", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -1.508049488067627}, {"text": "totally", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "red", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.4179159998893738}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.35317695140838623}, {"text": "che", "logprob": -0.11341798305511475}, {"text": "apest", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "way", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "achieve", "logprob": -0.16640736162662506}, {"text": "this", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "is", "logprob": -0.6448940634727478}, {"text": "through", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "use", "logprob": -0.16030748188495636}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "rub", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ber", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "around", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "hand", "logprob": -2.153221607208252}, {"text": "shape", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "hard", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "pl", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "astic", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "shape", "logprob": -0.049333903938531876}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": -0.13458658754825592}, {"text": "around", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "it", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "hard", "logprob": -0.42555269598960876}, {"text": "rub", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ber", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.27358102798461914}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "hand", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "shape", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "is", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "also", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "rub", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ber", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["There were two groups, the young and trendy, and the old and rich.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: what things to talk about .\nGrad F: I 'm {disfmarker} What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive !\nGrad A: OK , we 're recording .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad B: Check check {pause} check check .\nGrad D: Uh , yeah .\nGrad F: Hello ? Which am I ?\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: Alright . Good .\nGrad F: Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is {disfmarker} on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .\nGrad D: Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} wait .\nGrad F: And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .\nGrad E: This is just one sheet , right ?\nGrad D: Ah ! Just one sheet .\nGrad F: It 's just one sheet .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad F: It 's just a {disfmarker} Nothing else .\nGrad D: Front , back .\nGrad F: Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's very similar to {disfmarker} There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .\nProfessor C: What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad F: So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction\nProfessor C: Oh , I see .\nGrad F: and they have some name .\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct\nGrad F: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: OK , that 's fine .\nGrad F: OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , thenneed everything that {disfmarker} that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the {disfmarker} the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you {disfmarker} we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the {disfmarker} the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be {disfmarker} can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the initial notes . But it 's {disfmarker} in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , {vocalsound} that 'd be kind of funky .\nProfessor C: Um , it sounds to me like you want P R\nGrad A: P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Beca - because it {disfmarker} b because {disfmarker} No , no , you can't . See the {disfmarker} the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can {disfmarker} then you can unfold it .\nGrad A: Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , no , but it matters a lot because you {disfmarker} what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case .\nGrad A: And then {disfmarker} then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} the only way it works .\nProfessor C: Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: \nProfessor C: Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have to see .\nGrad A: But , uh ,\nProfessor C: Uh {disfmarker} Yes . This is {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Except there 's no {disfmarker} no theorem prover involved .\nGrad F: Best explanation .\nProfessor C: No , there isn't a theorem prover but there {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but the , um , The cove the {disfmarker} the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're {disfmarker} you 're coupling a bunch of them together .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm , yeah .\nProfessor C: And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . Uh {disfmarker} Tricky . But you {disfmarker} yeah , it 's a good {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal .\nGrad A: What 's it ?\nProfessor C: So are you gonna write something for us before you go ?\nGrad A: Yes . Um .\nProfessor C: Oh , you have something .\nGrad A: In the process thereof , or whatever .\nProfessor C: OK . So , what 's {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} when are we gonna meet again ?\nGrad F: When are you leaving ?\nGrad A: Fri - uh ,\nGrad F: Thursday , Friday ?\nGrad A: Thursday 's my last day here .\nGrad D: Fri\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: So {disfmarker} I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?\nProfessor C: N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . We {disfmarker} obviously we can {disfmarker} we can do this . But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? Or {disfmarker}\nGrad A: We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah .\nGrad E: Fine with me . Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A: Sure .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad A: Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh {disfmarker} the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And we can make some last minute changes on that .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .\nProfessor C: That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . Yeah , that {disfmarker} Alright .\nGrad F: Can we do {disfmarker} can we do one - thirty ?\nGrad A: No .\nGrad F: Oh , you already told me no .\nGrad A: But we can do four .\nGrad F: One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine . It 's fine .\nGrad A: One or four . I don't care .\nGrad E: To me this is equal . I don't care .\nGrad A: If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ?\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's fine .\nGrad A: Four ?\nGrad F: Fine . Yeah {disfmarker} no , no , no , uh , I don't care . It 's fine .\nGrad A: It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four .\nGrad B: The pressure 's on you Nancy .\nGrad A: Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know {disfmarker} the discussions short .\nGrad F: OK . OK , four .\nGrad E: Well , if you insist , then .\nGrad F: OK ? OK .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad A: OK , we 're on .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?\nPhD F: Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .\nPhD C: Is that English ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago\nPhD D: That 's our system .\nGrad A: Ugh !\nPhD F: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .\nGrad A: C can I have a pen ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers\nPhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?\nPhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: For IBM , yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .\nPhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM\nGrad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: No , no .\nPhD F: Oh no no .\nGrad A: We haven't done that process .\nPhD D: no ?\nPhD F: No . We 're not waiting on them .\nGrad A: So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .\nPhD D: Oh . Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .\nPhD F: We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD D: and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .\nGrad A: Yep , sounds familiar .\nPhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .\nPhD D: It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .{disfmarker} were training {pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the meeting\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the transcription status, with Grad A mentioning that Jane is not present but has assigned five or six meetings for transcriptions.

Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about technical function design.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the technical function design of the new remote control. They identified the user needs and preferences, such as ease of use, aesthetics, and the ability to control the TV and other devices with just a clap. The team also discussed the current limitations of remote controls, such as their ugliness, lack of easy-to-use functionality, and the frustration users experience with losing them. They suggested incorporating features like speech recognition and the ability to phone the remote control to make it more convenient and user-friendly. The team also considered the issue of people without hands and decided to prioritize features that are universal and accessible to everyone.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0},

You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel theyhere right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: OK .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What were the main discussion points of the meeting?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " The main discussion points of the meeting were:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveand that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about hourly rates of the service.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, discussed the early implementer local authority areas for the childcare offer, and the mixed bag of responses received. The bureaucracy around the current approach was highlighted, with parents providing wage slips and birth certificates, and the burden of administration falling to each pilot area. The administrative burden was considered a challenge, and the preferred option for the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model was supported by local authority providers. The expansion of the offer across Gwynedd, Anglesey, and Caerphilly, and the anticipation of doing so in Flintshire and Rhondda Cynon Taf were discussed. The demand for services was not spread evenly across Wales, and the impact of the scheme on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age was considered. The early assessment of the income levels of families who found the offer most attractive was also discussed, with the majority of parents below the average income of £26,000 in Wales. Finally, the consideration of integrating the Welsh Government offer with the UK Government's offer of tax-free childcare was addressed.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was Kirsty Williams' opinion of the decision of not accrediting the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Kirsty Williams expressed her disappointment at the decision not to accredit the University of South Wales to deliver teacher training, stating that it was \"not the whole answer\" to the issues facing teacher recruitment and retention in Wales.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those aresure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Vaughan Gething think of the mental health recovery plan when talking about the ways of continuing mental health service during the lockdown?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Vaughan Gething AM stated that he is still learning about the impact of the virus on children and young people's mental health, and the developing knowledge base on the topic.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveof target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have tocould do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the User Interface think about their previous suggestions when discussing the user interface?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the User Interface seemed to have some reservations about their previous suggestions.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takesto you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , see you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did the group think of the locator when presenting the functional requirements?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the group thought of the locator when presenting the functional requirements because they were discussing how to locate the remote control if it were to be lost or misplaced.

Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug .

So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is al{disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits .

And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkersell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveage is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Huw Irranca-Davies think about the affordability of lowest-income working families when talking about hourly rates of the service?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Huw Irranca-Davies AM mentioned that the majority of parents in Wales are below the average income of £26,000, and that very few families are those who are on higher incomes.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ?

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of awhich was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How would the allocation contribute to educational research?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to Dr. David Blaney, the allocation of money from the Diamond reforms will help universities in Wales to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, including the costs of servicing their borrowings.

So first to {disfmarker} we have to make a small painting . What have {disfmarker} do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use {vocalsound} the pen and the eraser . So {disfmarker} Now . We all have to use this one .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You have to make your own favourite animal .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So I'll make an example .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: First don't touch that things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You can use the pen . And then you can make {vocalsound} um something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um you can change some things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um format , line , and change it . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can change the colour .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: An elephant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So that's it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} So and after it you have to save it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Now we can make a new one .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: You have to paint now . {vocalsound} So you're next .\nMarketing: Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well we will try . Where it going ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That's uh strange . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nProject Manager: What is going on ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} pop-ups .\nProject Manager: What are you {disfmarker} What ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What is this , Pictionary .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh a bird .\nProject Manager: Is a {disfmarker} It is a {disfmarker} It is a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Bird .\nProject Manager: A duck .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Now save ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: Now uh blank ?\nProject Manager: Blank , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay next one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Let's try this . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Whoo .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um . Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh not . Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Shit happens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: A parrot . Ish .\nMarketing: Wow . Oh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: He did it before .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No , no . Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nUser Interface: Uh blank .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . {gap} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So {vocalsound} now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I will start .\nProject Manager: F first {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh g big buttons , {vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: Big buttons , positive .\nProject Manager: Positive .\nIndustrial Designer: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .\nProject Manager: Okay . What are your experiences ?\nUser Interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So and do they always have that ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} No no no . But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .\nProject Manager: It's easy to you .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing: That's not really ea easy .\nIndustrial Designer: Help also . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v {vocalsound} not easy to use . So we n barely used it .\nProject Manager: Okay so they have too much . So next .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The weight . Not not too heavy .\nProject Manager: Not too heavy . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Not much buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Like a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Next .\nProject Manager: that's {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .\nProject Manager: Okay . This is {disfmarker} It has to be compatible with other things .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: I have one more idea . Just popped up .\nProject Manager: Yes ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .\nProject Manager: No battery use . So more ideas ?\nUser Interface: Mm no .\nProject Manager: No okay . It's only the first ideas . So {vocalsound} uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your {gap} . And {disfmarker} Next instructions you'll get in your email . So {disfmarker} This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .

Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Uh no .\nUser Interface: I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Dash .\nMarketing: And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you can\nProject Manager: yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mdays on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did Eluned Morgan respond to whether wishing to see people have greater pay equality between schoolteachers and FE when discussing the pay dispute situation?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Eluned Morgan responded that the Welsh Government is aware of ColegauCymru's position regarding the pay dispute and the need for an additional 3.5% or £10.1 million to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nHmm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takeser to you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , see you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group think of disposable income when discussing general requirements?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it seems that the group did not specifically discuss disposable income during the meeting.

What the {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Yeah well , ja well let's just start .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .\nMarketing: Right let's see it .\nProject Manager: So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . Well {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh {vocalsound} I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in ,\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: and uh hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh sorry . {vocalsound} And {gap} an uh a nice agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So {vocalsound} this the opening we'll uh {disfmarker} We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's {vocalsound} also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh {disfmarker} Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Other uh {disfmarker} There happen to be uh three stages . {gap} functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . {gap} you have a {disfmarker} these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . {vocalsound} This is just a {gap} . I want to uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah .

So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write .

So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: not my idea . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright , your favourite animal ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Grizzly bear . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: w I dunno what I'm going to design .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh um {vocalsound} doesn't {disfmarker} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:ound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And have {disfmarker} well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . {vocalsound} The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But are {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: but that's pretty obvious , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?\nProject Manager: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .\nMarketing: I think {vocalsound} we should make it universal\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it {vocalsound} just plain\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nMarketing: but you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} To make it more trendy .\nProject Manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yes . Yes .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well you can make profit with them , and it's {vocalsound} a way to make them trendy .\nProject Manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself {vocalsound} so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nUser Interface: Yeah alright {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah normal .\nIndustrial Designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\nUser Interface: No a colour everyone accepts .\nProject Manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Pink television sets {vocalsound} pink remote , {gap} .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {gap} standard .\nMarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black .\nUser Interface: Well young people s li\nMarketing: Yeah but then you can use {vocalsound} a a front .\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well if if you {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it .

I will investigate .\nProject Manager: Yes . {vocalsound} Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh {gap} I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .\nProject Manager: Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too .\nProject Manager: Euro ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y you went to the company website {gap} .\nMarketing: It's {disfmarker} Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: if you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the the the start uh starting page uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Finish meeting now .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-h}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I have, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about the early implementer areas.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " In the early implementer areas, the Welsh Government's childcare offer has faced some challenges, including a burden on local authorities with regards to administration, and a lack of awareness about the UK tax-free childcare offer.

We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you.

Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those areshare my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Julie Morgan elaborate on the online survey when talking about the evaluations on the legitimacy of the children's rights, protection and demands?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Julie Morgan elaborated on the online survey by stating that the Welsh Government had carried out an evaluation of the legitimacy of children's rights, protection, and demands, and the findings of the survey showed that there was a need for improvement in the area of children's rights and protection.

Well {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh {vocalsound} I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in ,\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: and uh hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh sorry . {vocalsound} And {gap} an uh a nice agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So {vocalsound} this the opening we'll uh {disfmarker} We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's {vocalsound} also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh {disfmarker} Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Other uh {disfmarker} There happen to be uh three stages . {gap} functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw .

You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting .

Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those are.\nSian Gwenllian AM: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward.

Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Uh no .\nUser Interface: I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Dash .\nMarketing: And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you can\nProject Manager: yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .\nUser Interface: I once had it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: History . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think we have full of idea .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .

I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of awas developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the solution to risk appetite?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the solution to managing risk appetite is not explicitly mentioned. However, Dr David Blaney did mention that the decisions made by the governing body of Trinity Saint David were \"perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time.\" This suggests that the institution made decisions based on the information available to them at the time, rather than taking unnecessary risks. Additionally, HEFCW is consulting on providing £15 million in innovation funding in 2020-21, which may help universities manage risk and improve their ability to access funding from UKRI.",

And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkersell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys .

I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-h}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the final decision of the discussion about automatic power control?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it seems that the final decision regarding automatic power control was not made during the meeting.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takesyeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ?

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mcoming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the committee discussed the recruitment and retention of teachers in Wales, particularly in secondary schools.

Then they had a discussion on the decision made by the education workforce council not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training. After this, there were some questions and answers related to the reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector, equality of opportunity and university mergers. In addition, the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education and funding allocation were also discussed. Then they talked about the regional skills partnerships and the pay dispute situation. At last, they shared some opinions on 'legalised cheating'."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 16516}

Who starts ?\nProject Manager: Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting .\nMarketing: Alright , great . Alright .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Uh oh . {vocalsound} This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so {disfmarker} Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh {disfmarker} Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh {disfmarker} I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements ,\nMarketing: No . You're the only one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'll have a look if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ?\nProject Manager: Uh yeah , I think so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well uh {gap} the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} now I'll look at {gap} show {gap} this board . Um {disfmarker} Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . {vocalsound} It's uh one of our ideas .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so it's not quite uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But well I have to do it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm , now it's right .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from {gap} , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . It should be uh recognisable at all times .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Well fronts were to be {gap} just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um {disfmarker} And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .\nIndustrial Designer: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker} the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .\nMarketing: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , alright .\nUser Interface: Oh , that's a shame .\nProject Manager: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .\nMarketing: Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: so we uh have to go on .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um {disfmarker} Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we are a {vocalsound} real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I didn't know what company we were ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndInterface: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ?\nProject Manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well if you {vocalsound} you take those th If you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Why go to video ?\nProject Manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: The the video channel uh ?\nUser Interface: That's just zero . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote .\nIndustrial Designer: No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .\nProject Manager: Yes . I don't .\nUser Interface: Yes , I think th\nProject Manager: I go to ninety-nine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No , then you press ninety nine .\nMarketing: Ah uh well whatever , {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th that's the button uh {disfmarker} No .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's easy to go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .\nProject Manager: No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .\nProject Manager: I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've saidgiven incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Minister of Seniors say about pandemic assistance for seniors?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the Minister of Seniors did not say anything about pandemic assistance for seniors.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": -0.8525612950325012}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Minister", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Sen", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "iors", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "did", "logprob": -0.6816142201423645}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "say", "logprob": -2.0458984375}, {"text": "anything", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "about", "logprob": -0.5556862950325012}, {"text": "pan", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "demic", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "assistance", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "sen", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "iors", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": -0.14476674795150757}], "answers": ["The Minister of Seniors clarified that his office recognizes that seniors are in great need.

Okay , cool .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , I think mine's fallen off .\nUser Interface: It fell {disfmarker} That's why .\nMarketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh okay .\nUser Interface: Ah .\nProject Manager: Okay ? {vocalsound} Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer: Wow .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Very official .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll go from there .\nProject Manager: Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing: Prove it\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing: yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nMarketing: Works for me .\nProject Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: getting into it um\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible andre gonna have to be careful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In in\nMarketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager: Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing: Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager: I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} something ,\nMarketing: Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface: I like .\nIndustrial Designer: patent it .\nUser Interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing: Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface: Th\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface: That's cool .\nMarketing: Probably .\nUser Interface: I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager: Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Curves .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing: Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S true .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager: Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing: Euros .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Mm-mm .\nProject Manager: They serve um {disfmarker} right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .\nMarketing: With half an hour ?\nProject Manager: Um . Yes .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Perfect .\nProject Manager: Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nUser Interface: Thank you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Project Manager think of the profit when discussing the financial issue and why?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the Project Manager seemed to be concerned about the profitability of the remote control product. During the discussion on financial issues, the Project Manager mentioned that selling a forty-pound remote would be expensive and that they might need to trade off some features for a lower price. The Project Manager also mentioned that they were targeting a price of twenty-five Euros, which is slightly different from the dollar amount. This suggests that the Project Manager was thinking about the profit margin of the product and was considering how to balance the features and price to make it financially viable.",

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hInterface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing technical function design?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the user interface designer recommended that the team focus on the component concept and design, specifically on the user interface aspect, during the individual work session.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Based", "logprob": -1.1389622688293457}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "user", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "interface", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "designer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "recommended", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": -0.33794695138931274}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "team", "logprob": -0.1579262912273407}, {"text": "focus", "logprob": -2.4893898963928223}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.2101299911737442}, {"text": "component", "logprob": -0.3008694648742676}, {"text": "concept", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": -0.12692804634571075}, {"text": "design", "logprob": -0.44681933522224426}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.6172647476196289}, {"text": "specifically", "logprob": -0.23440459370613098}, {"text": "on", "logprob": -0.5475583076477051}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "user", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "interface", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "aspect", "logprob": -0.26349955797195435}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.6396087408065796}, {"text": "during", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "individual", "logprob": -0.10477202385663986}, {"text": "work", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "session", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["The user interface designer recommended to have a screen with a backlight which could change colours and to put all the options into this screen so that few buttons were needed and users would find it easy to use.

Okay , cool .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , I think mine's fallen off .\nUser Interface: It fell {disfmarker} That's why .\nMarketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh okay .\nUser Interface: Ah .\nProject Manager: Okay ? {vocalsound} Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer: Wow .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Very official .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll go from there .\nProject Manager: Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing: Prove it\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing: yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nMarketing: Works for me .\nProject Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: getting into it um\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible and: Mm .\nMarketing: so we're gonna have to be careful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In in\nMarketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager: Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing: Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager: I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} something ,\nMarketing: Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface: I like .\nIndustrial Designer: patent it .\nUser Interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing: Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface: Th\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface: That's cool .\nMarketing: Probably .\nUser Interface: I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager: Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Curves .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing: Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S true .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager: Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing: Euros .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar .

This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for fI guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What's the conclusion of the discussion about intuitive when presenting on evaluation criteria?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it appears that the conclusion of the discussion about intuitive when presenting on evaluation criteria is that the team agrees that the design of the remote control is quite novel and new, and they are considering patenting the idea.

I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mGovernment for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did Kirsty Williams respond to university mergers?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, did not mention university mergers during the meeting.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've saidwe were given incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Prime Minister say about fraud in distribution of funds?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the Prime Minister stated that the government has measures in place to detect fraud and that anyone who received money fraudulently will have to repay it.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveand work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Barry Hughes think about the registration of grandparents when talking about childcare offer?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Barry Hughes expressed no particular opinion on the registration of grandparents when talking about childcare offer during the meeting transcript provided.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Barry", "logprob": -0.29683318734169006}, {"text": "Hugh", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "es", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "expressed", "logprob": -1.2137730121612549}, {"text": "no", "logprob": -1.3888118267059326}, {"text": "particular", "logprob": -1.7629032135009766}, {"text": "opinion", "logprob": -0.5105117559432983}, {"text": "on", "logprob": -0.7311989068984985}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "registration", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "grand", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "par", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ents", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "when", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "talking", "logprob": -1.663254976272583}, {"text": "about", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "child", "logprob": -2.177525758743286}, {"text": "care", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "offer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "during", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": -0.6699843406677246}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provided", "logprob": -0.30908337235450745}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": -0.5125571489334106}], "answers": ["Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized that the focus was on registered licensed providers, for the childcare offer wanted to have a higher quality and provided wider aspects than single childcare.

Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those arecan share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Vaughan Gething think of the perinatal mental health service when discussing the long-term special care for the pregnant women?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Vaughan Gething AM did not provide any specific comments or answers regarding the perinatal mental health service during the meeting discussed in the transcript.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "V", "logprob": -0.061035625636577606}, {"text": "aug", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "han", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "G", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ething", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "AM", "logprob": -0.27552124857902527}, {"text": "did", "logprob": -0.30573782324790955}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provide", "logprob": -0.3689931035041809}, {"text": "any", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "specific", "logprob": -1.9260472059249878}, {"text": "comments", "logprob": -0.18760892748832703}, {"text": "or", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "answers", "logprob": -0.47828638553619385}, {"text": "regarding", "logprob": -0.467671275138855}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -1.7137008905410767}, {"text": "per", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "in", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "atal", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "mental", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "health", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "service", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "during", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": -1.9118670225143433}, {"text": "in", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": -0.11450104415416718}], "answers": ["Besides the crisis care, Vaughan Gething also claimed that they did not stop the perinatal mental health service either.

Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer: Wow .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Very official .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll go from there .\nProject Manager: Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing: Prove it\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing: yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nMarketing: Works for me .\nProject Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: getting into it um\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible andcareful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In in\nMarketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager: Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing: Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager: I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} something ,\nMarketing: Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface: I like .\nIndustrial Designer: patent it .\nUser Interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing: Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface: Th\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface: That's cool .\nMarketing: Probably .\nUser Interface: I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager: Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Curves .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing: Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S true .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager: Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing: Euros .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Mm-mm .\nProject Manager: They serve um {disfmarker} right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .\nMarketing: With half an hour ?\nProject Manager: Um . Yes .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Perfect .\nProject Manager: Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nUser Interface: Thank you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Industrial Designer put forward that the appearance design should be paid due attention when discussing the user interface?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, Industrial Designer proposed that the appearance design should be given attention because they want to ensure that the remote control they are designing is aesthetically pleasing, not just functional.

Oops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , pinball .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nUser Interface: Mine . Oh , great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Large .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .fmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And charging their remote ,\nMarketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing: Yay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved andh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer: Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing: Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager: Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing: Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager: I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager: On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager: In the centre ,\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah , sure .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager: Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface: we need to {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did the Marketing think they should have LCD when presenting the market trends?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the Marketing Expert believed that incorporating LCD screens into the remote control design would be a good idea for marketing reasons, as it would make the product look more advanced and cutting-edge.

Doesn't look like it crashed . That 's great .\nGrad G: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .\nPostdoc B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?\nPhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing .\nPostdoc B: I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}\nGrad G: No .\nPostdoc B: I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?\nGrad G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nGrad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .\nProfessor E: And start by giving the transcript number .\nPhD A: Tran\nPhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .\nPhD A: Oh sorry , go ahead .\nProfessor E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .\nGrad H: OK .\nProfessor E: It 's just uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H: Umh .\nProfessor E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .\nGrad G: And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some\nGrad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: like some other noise .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel theywe have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: OK .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the future of data collection?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it seems that the future of data collection for the project is uncertain.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those arecan share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Julie Morgan elaborate on their work with the foster organizations when talking about the adequate social support for those children who were in foster?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Julie Morgan elaborated on the Welsh Government's work with foster organizations to ensure that children in foster care have adequate social support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record. Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did D think about the experimental setup of the computer navigation system?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " D thought that the experimental setup of the computer navigation system was problematic because car navigation systems don't really care about taking users to the actual entrance of a building, but instead take them to the mailbox or some other location far from the entrance.

Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the discussion about the government's policy to improve long-term care facilities and protect the seniors?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, no discussion was held about the government's policy to improve long-term care facilities and protect seniors.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those areand the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Albert Heaney think of the coronavirus Act when discussing the evaluations on the legitimacy of the children's rights, protection and demands?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Albert Heaney, the deputy director general of the health and social services group, did not provide any specific comments or opinions on the COVID-19 Act during the meeting.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "According", "logprob": -0.10477202385663986}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": -1.4061501026153564}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Albert", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "He", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "an", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ey", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.17071041464805603}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.6931471824645996}, {"text": "deput", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "y", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "director", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "general", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "health", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "social", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "services", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "group", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "did", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provide", "logprob": -0.687970757484436}, {"text": "any", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "specific", "logprob": -2.0555291175842285}, {"text": "comments", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "or", "logprob": -0.15121398866176605}, {"text": "opinions", "logprob": -0.5503450036048889}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "COVID", "logprob": -1.8294217586517334}, {"text": "-", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "1", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "9", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Act", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "during", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": -0.3217625319957733}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["When it comes to the evaluations on the legitimacy of the children's rights, protection and demands, Nicola Edwards mentioned that they had been working on the coronavirus Act to see if they could ease some of the statutory requirements, further helping the childcare and education affairs in the future.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those are, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Vaughan Gething elaborate on the crisis care when talking about the evaluations on the increasing suicide crimes during the COVID-19 and the long-term special carefor the pregnant women?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Vaughan Gething elaborated on the crisis care for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that while the current plan for surge capacity in paediatric care is in place, the challenge is in understanding how to safely reopen schools and manage the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children and the wider community.

So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about user interface concept.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the user interface concept for the remote control.

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hearWhat d d d um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'llon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the questioning about the reports on long-term care facilities?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Mrs. Tamara Jansen asked the Hon. Anita Anand about the drop in N95 mask orders, and Anand explained that the government has multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing the border weekly over the next month.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mUK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize their discussions on university mergers.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the committee discussed the issue of teacher training and recruitment, particularly in light of the fact that only 65% of the target number of trainees are being filled. The panel talked about different strategies, including financial incentives and marketing campaigns, as well as their desire to encourage more individuals to become teachers and to serve their country by training to teach in Wales. They also talked about how this issue is not unique to Wales and is a problem all over the world.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the debate about a particular fundraising campaign?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, there was no debate about a particular fundraising campaign.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those areI'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the problem of the priority for the vulnerable children and adequate social support for those who were in foster.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Siân Gwenllian AM asked about the support package for key workers and the provision for vulnerable children, including those in foster care.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about the functional design of the remote control.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the functional design of the remote control. They agreed that they want the design to be original, user-friendly, and have a high battery life. They also mentioned that they want to avoid having too many buttons on the remote control, as most people only use a few buttons on their existing remote controls.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those arethat's very much live at the moment.\nSian Gwenllian AM: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the committee discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and social services in Wales, particularly in relation to children and young people.

Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ?

OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mmight like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize their discussion on the decision of not accrediting the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, mentioned that the University of South Wales had applied to be an ITE provider, but their application had been declined due to concerns about the quality of their training.

Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .Then it's {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Bye bye .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Okay, based on the provided meeting transcript, the summary of the meeting can be stated as follows:\n\nThe meeting was focused on the design of the new remote control for the company's upcoming product launch.

What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for thatto play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Grad F think about intermediate categories?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Grad F was planning to write a proposal and give it to people ahead of time, with a short presentation followed by questions from the audience.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those areand the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward.

I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nInd\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkerit's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about industrial components.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the conceptual design of a remote control for a project.

Okay , cool .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , I think mine's fallen off .\nUser Interface: It fell {disfmarker} That's why .\nMarketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh okay .\nUser Interface: Ah .\nProject Manager: Okay ? {vocalsound} Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer: Wow .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Very official .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll go from there .\nProject Manager: Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing: Prove it\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing: yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nMarketing: Works for me .\nProject Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: getting into it um\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible andhave to be careful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In in\nMarketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager: Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing: Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager: I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} something ,\nMarketing: Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface: I like .\nIndustrial Designer: patent it .\nUser Interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing: Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface: Th\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface: That's cool .\nMarketing: Probably .\nUser Interface: I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager: Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Curves .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing: Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S true .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager: Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing: Euros .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Mm-mm .\nProject Manager: They serve um {disfmarker} right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .\nMarketing: With half an hour ?\nProject Manager: Um . Yes .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Perfect .\nProject Manager: Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nUser Interface: Thank you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Industrial Designer recommend to do when discussing the naming of remote control and why?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the Industrial Designer recommended patenting the name of the remote control.

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hearfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good idea .\nProject Manager: Thanks for coming .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the team think about the new idea of Industrial Designer concerning the cover of the device?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, it seems that the team was not fully convinced of the new idea proposed by the Industrial Designer regarding the cover of the device.

Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .\nMarketing: Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: so we uh have to go on .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .

Yeah . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .\nProject Manager: I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ .

Chief ?\nProject Manager: Yes see .\nIndustrial Designer: Th the menu menu button is also important .\nProject Manager: Yes I have put it in .\nIndustrial Designer: Then you can uh {disfmarker} Where ? {vocalsound} I don't see it .\nProject Manager: Here .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh Menu , alright .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu .\nUser Interface: Or the volume or something like that .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Or the volume , yeah .\nProject Manager: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Your pen .\nMarketing: Ah . Great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes chief .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well see you uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ?\nProject Manager: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is this is your thing .\nUser Interface: Yeah , lunch break .\nMarketing: Ah . Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: I am hungry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Lunch .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Get into my belly . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See you later mate . {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did User Interface think they should use more buttons than the current one when discussing the technical function design?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, User Interface suggested using more buttons than the current one during the meeting to accommodate the new project requirements from the bosses, specifically the inclusion of a button for the D_V_D_ function.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takesto you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , see you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the presentations on working design, technical functions, functional requirements.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the attendees discussed the working design of the remote control, technical functions, and functional requirements.

Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those arelian AM: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize their evaluations on the legitimacy of the children's rights, protection and demands.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the committee discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and young people in Wales, and the role of the Welsh Government in addressing their needs. The Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething AM, acknowledged that children are less likely to be affected by COVID-19 than older people but may still become unwell. He also mentioned that the Welsh Government has a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care and is continuing to test itself to see if it is enough. However, he cautioned that coming out of lockdown may be more difficult than going into it and that the current capacity may not be enough if the number of critical cases increases. The committee expressed concern about the provision of support for childcare providers who are struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic, and the need for a bespoke scheme to help them. Overall, the discussion highlighted the importance of prioritizing the rights and protection of children during the pandemic and beyond.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers\nPhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?\nPhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: For IBM , yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .\nPhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM\nGrad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: No , no .\nPhD F: Oh no no .\nGrad A: We haven't done that process .\nPhD D: no ?\nPhD F: No . We 're not waiting on them .\nGrad A: So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .\nPhD D: Oh . Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .\nPhD F: We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD D: and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .\nGrad A: Yep , sounds familiar .\nPhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .\nPhD D: It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .{pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion on storage disks and computer connections\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the storage disks and computer connections.

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you heardisfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good idea .\nProject Manager: Thanks for coming .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Industrial Designer say about the structure of the device?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, Industrial Designer said that the device should have a simple and easy-to-use structure, with only a few buttons, and the buttons should be placed in a way that makes sense for the user.

Mike - one ?\nPhD B: Ah .\nProfessor D: We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal ., I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Professor think about the results?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the Professor seemed to be satisfied with the results of the experiments conducted by the PhD students.

About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfYeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the meeting\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the attendees discussed the results of their latest experiments with LDA tuning, specifically the downsampling problem and the length of the filters.

This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for fmm\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mmight like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Did Kirsty Williams feel there had been any disadvantages to Cardiff Met because that merger did not go ahead?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Kirsty Williams did not mention any disadvantages to Cardiff Met due to the merger not going ahead.

Um {disfmarker} Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . {vocalsound} It's uh one of our ideas .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so it's not quite uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But well I have to do it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm , now it's right .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from {gap} , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . It should be uh recognisable at all times .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Well fronts were to be {gap} just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um {disfmarker} And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .\nIndustrial Designer: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker} the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .\nMarketing: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , alright .\nUser Interface: Oh , that's a shame .\nProject Manager: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .\nMarketing: Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: so we uh have to go on .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um {disfmarker} Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we are a {vocalsound} real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I didn't know what company we were ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ?\nProject Manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well if you {vocalsound} you take those th If you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Why go to video ?\nProject Manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: The the video channel uh ?\nUser Interface: That's just zero . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote .\nIndustrial Designer: No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .\nProject Manager: Yes . I don't .\nUser Interface: Yes , I think th\nProject Manager: I go to ninety-nine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No , then you press ninety nine .\nMarketing: Ah uh well whatever , {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th that's the button uh {disfmarker} No .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's easy to go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .\nProject Manager: No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .\nProject Manager: I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels .\nProject Manager: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , I do . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah well y you must have .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah y you you you you have screen width .\nUser Interface: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from {vocalsound} s set frequency o or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . That's the only one we put uh in there .\nProject Manager: So we still {gap} have one uh four ?\nMarketing: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .\nProject Manager: Ch ch\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Programme , right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Oh the Okay button ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .\nUser Interface: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Menu button .\nIndustrial Designer: You should {disfmarker} Yeah . I think that's important .\nProject Manager: Channel , setting , menu .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap} And and the settings to change the brightness {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} We have to go . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Channel , yeah .\nProject Manager: So um Save .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Chief ? Chief ?\nProject Manager: Yes see .\nIndustrial Designer: Th the menu menu button is also important .\nProject Manager: Yes I have put it in .\nIndustrial Designer: Then you can uh {disfmarker} Where ? {vocalsound} I don't see it .\nProject Manager: Here .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh Menu , alright .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu .\nUser Interface: Or the volume or something like that .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Or the volume , yeah .\nProject Manager: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Your pen .\nMarketing: Ah . Great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes chief .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well see you uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ?\nProject Manager: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is this is your thing .\nUser Interface: Yeah , lunch break .\nMarketing: Ah . Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: I am hungry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Lunch .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Get into my belly . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkerI think it's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

After that, the group talked about LCD display and locating methods. The second topic was user interface concept, which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons. The group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs. To make a smart controller, they mentioned speech recognition and user identification. When it came to trend watching, the marketing put forward three noteworthy aspects - being fancy, technologically innovative and useful.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor Cwith a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What were the problems encountered with SmartKom system?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the problems encountered with the SmartKom system were:\n\n1.

So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible\nUser Interface: And chocolate ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . {vocalsound} And that's all . Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , here we have our prototype model .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you have some slides then ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes , and place some slides .\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Him .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .\nIndustrial Designer: Experience . Explanat\nUser Interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device .\nMarketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So you can touch it with your hands .\nMarketing: Can I ?\nUser Interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N\nMarketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing: I will uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} One day .\nMarketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .\nMarketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This this is really flexible .

So function , mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nInd{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Well , project evaluation .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Maybe a lack of leadership ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: M maybe not , huh ?\nMarketing: Team-work , very strong , I would say .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , our team-work is really strong .\nMarketing: Team-work , no problem .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And charging their remote ,\nMarketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing: Yay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved anduh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer: Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing: Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager: Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing: Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager: I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager: On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager: In the centre ,\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah , sure .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager: Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface: we need to {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Industrial Designer think of the scroll wheel when presenting the user interface?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Industrial Designer seemed to be open to the idea of incorporating a spinning wheel into the remote control design during the meeting.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor Cto do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What would happen after the demo?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " After the demo, Professor C suggested that Ami would give a talk at either EML or another relevant institution in Geneva, and Grad B would send an email to let him know.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've said. Chair, earlier today we were given incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Prime Minister say about students?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the Prime Minister did not mention anything about students.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "According", "logprob": -0.25192904472351074}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Prime", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Minister", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "did", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "mention", "logprob": -0.7481971383094788}, {"text": "anything", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "about", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "students", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["The Prime Minister clarified that while young people are in need of funds, especially due to loss of income over the summer, they are also in need of work experience.

And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .s {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Bye bye .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about interface concept design.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the interface concept design for the remote control.

Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes , and place some slides .\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Him .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .\nIndustrial Designer: Experience .

Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N\nMarketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing: I will uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} One day .\nMarketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .\nMarketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons .\nMarketing: It's in option . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Well , project evaluation .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Maybe a lack of leadership ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: M maybe not , huh ?\nMarketing: Team-work , very strong , I would say .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , our team-work is really strong .\nMarketing: Team-work , no problem .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of aid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the meeting discuss about universities that had secured funding for investing in their estates?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the discussion centered around the issue of university reserves and their ability to generate surplus cash to meet costs, particularly in light of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds and the impact of the Augar review in England.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the debate over the situation of long-term care?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, no debate or discussion was held on the situation of long-term care.

So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfas you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the professor seemed to be open to the idea of improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task, but also recognized that there are limitations to how much better it can be made, especially in terms of the amount of computation that can be used.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and recordunpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK .

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hearfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .

Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal .I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did PhD A think about the results?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, PhD A seemed to be satisfied with the results of the experiments, as they were \"not completely filled\" and there was still a \"gap\" between the different training sets.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , pinball .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nUser Interface: Mine . Oh , great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Large .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .{disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting .

Uh door is closed . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up .\nMarketing: I'm listening .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Great .\nProject Manager: Yo . So . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This one I think .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um {disfmarker} Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} this time we exactly know what to decide about .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright , great .\nProject Manager: And then we'll close again .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker} Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll {vocalsound} first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Walter will uh start again this time ?\nMarketing: Yeah , great .\nProject Manager: Yo .\nMarketing: Alright , Trendwatch .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Uh the trends . {vocalsound} It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but {vocalsound} it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nMarketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important ,\nProject Manager: Less . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and uh same for this one . {vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .\nProject Manager: Well , yeah .\nMarketing: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .\nMarketing: Right . {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .\nIndustrial Designer: Easy to use ?\nProject Manager: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's your ta\nUser Interface: {gap}\nProject Manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .\nMarketing: Yeah , I know .\nProject Manager: Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think we have to go for the first one .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: It's the most important one . So {gap} we have to uh take that one .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy .\nUser Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: We'll see . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device .\nMarketing: Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow , that's real great uh great concept .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it must be very bright , very colourful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People like this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So i set your mind to it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh you think ?\nMarketing: I am told . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Bananas .\nMarketing: Uh furthermore uvocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What are you doing chief ?\nProject Manager: So , you can uh draw a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I think we have to wait ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nProject Manager: Well I'll get a {disfmarker} I'll get the message .\nIndustrial Designer: until the until the beep goes .\nMarketing: No {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But I don't uh {disfmarker} Do we have to stay here ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , I think uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: or I think we have to return first .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well you'll {disfmarker} Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . {gap}\nUser Interface: Maybe .\nProject Manager: Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates .\nIndustrial Designer: The high powers from above {vocalsound} will have to tell us , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I always have a mouse next to my laptop .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Dream on . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I hate these {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I I don't have a laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , touch-pads , yeah .\nProject Manager: Ugh .\nIndustrial Designer: We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No just kidding . Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too ,\nMarketing: You just have to push harder .\nIndustrial Designer: because it becomes too too too too stressy .\nProject Manager: And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Aha . This has no function . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Half\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: But they do want some gadgets . So that's wha what we're doing .\nMarketing: It's all about cool things .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it will sell .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We will be rich .\nIndustrial Designer: Bless you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well we won't .

We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Its the best remote ever .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Pinball .\nProject Manager: Oh {gap} . Oh he's totally off again . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No man .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you have to push harder . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But when I start here , it's here .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So is it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and I don't think that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Nope .\nMarketing: Recalibrate it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We can better uh draw a design on this . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but we can't .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh {vocalsound} goes off again .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Let's go .\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Finish meeting now .\nProject Manager: Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so\nUser Interface: We'll stay here ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . Oh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Message ?\nUser Interface: Or we'll get the email .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ?\nProject Manager: No , get away . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ? Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Guess so .\nProject Manager: Um I I'm not sure . Maybe you {disfmarker} Yeah . Well you'll have to work on this one .\nUser Interface: Well we'll wait a few seconds\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface: and then we'll get an email .\nMarketing: Alright . Have fun lads .\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A happy hol happy holidays . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Good luck . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} but you can scratch it off or something .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\n\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and {vocalsound} okay let's begin . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . {gap} and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . Um , so {vocalsound} let's try the whiteboard {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so any of you who want to go .\nUser Interface: Yeah , for favourite animals .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And it's gonna be {disfmarker} you'll try to guess .\nMarketing: Wow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Complex .\nProject Manager: Wow . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Huh ?

Let's talk about money .\nUser Interface: Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} According to the drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , you're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Not me . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So .\nMarketing: Socan uh only make one working .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .\nUser Interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Three buttons you mean ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} like three mental states ,\nProject Manager: Three option .\nUser Interface: yeah you know what I mean ,\nMarketing: Ah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we can just make it uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um .\nUser Interface: controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: that ask you three {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .\nUser Interface: Sh sure , sure .\nMarketing: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Uh no .\nUser Interface: I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Dash .\nMarketing: And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you can\nProject Manager: yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .\nUser Interface: I once had it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: History . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think we have full of idea .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . {vocalsound} So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .\nMarketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?\nUser Interface: Market Expert .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Marketing {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: Uh that's me .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , of course {vocalsound} yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I'll think of that .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . So .\nMarketing: So ?\nProject Manager: I think that's all .\nMarketing: Meeting's over ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Great .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Thank you .\nProject Manager: See you in thirty minutes .\nUser Interface: Thank you everybody .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What's the decision of buttons size and scale design when discussing the design of the remote control?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the size and scale design of the buttons for the remote control. It was decided that they want to have more than three buttons, with each button representing a different mental state or action. The team also discussed the possibility of having a universal remote control with more than three buttons, but they acknowledged that it may need more than three options to be fully functional. However, they did not come to a final decision on the size and scale design of the buttons.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": -0.8048297166824341}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "team", "logprob": -2.6594412326812744}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "size", "logprob": -0.2434573620557785}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "scale", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": -0.2131100296974182}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "buttons", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": -0.4187747836112976}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "It", "logprob": -1.0241643190383911}, {"text": "was", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "decided", "logprob": -0.12419044226408005}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": -0.5691284537315369}, {"text": "want", "logprob": -0.7575989961624146}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "have", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "more", "logprob": -0.355744868516922}, {"text": "than", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "three", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "buttons", "logprob": -0.1556587964296341}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": -0.6399543285369873}, {"text": "each", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "button", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "representing", "logprob": -0.11450104415416718}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "different", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "mental", "logprob": -0.2554299533367157}, {"text": "state", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "or", "logprob": -0.7491868138313293}, {"text": "action", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "The", "logprob": -0.6829144954681396}, {"text": "team", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "also", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "discussed", "logprob": -0.05744180828332901}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "possibility", "logprob": -0.18233202397823334}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "having", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "universal", "logprob": -1.986899971961975}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "more", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "than", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "three", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "buttons", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "but", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": -0.11116685718297958}, {"text": "acknowled", "logprob": -1.4505162239074707}, {"text": "ged", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "it", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "may", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "need", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "more", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "than", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "three", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "options", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": -0.5105117559432983}, {"text": "be", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "fully", "logprob": -2.5192949771881104}, {"text": "functional", "logprob": -0.14476674795150757}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "However", "logprob": -0.2484705001115799}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "they", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "did", "logprob": -0.08129486441612244}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "come", "logprob": -0.22541262209415436}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "final", "logprob": -0.3196917772293091}, {"text": "decision", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "size", "logprob": -0.6437807083129883}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "scale", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "design", "logprob": -0.4566369652748108}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "buttons", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["It may require more than three millimetres with three buttons, and since there are not as many buttons, each button should be fully functional so that the basic requirements of the user can be met and the operation can be simple, or at least not too complicated, while they enjoy the function."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 4310}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys . Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Project Manager elaborate on the members when discussing the materials of the television remote?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, the Project Manager elaborated on the following materials for the television remote:\n\n* The remote should be made primarily of plastic construction, with some components, such as the chip, made of silicon.\n* The user interface (buttons and casing) should be made of high-grade recycled plastic to reduce environmental impact and potential lawsuits.\n* The sender (infrared signal transmitter) and receiver (electronic devices, mainly TVs) should be made of plastic or metal, depending on the design and

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've saidgiven incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Bains say about the arts, culture, and tourism industry?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Bains said that the government has taken significant steps to support the arts, culture, and tourism industry, including providing $50 million in funding for the Canada Arts Council and $75 million for the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund.

Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have toeting: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the conceptual design of a new remote control for a television. They discussed various components such as the case, buttons, and energy source, and debated whether to use a traditional infrared remote or a more innovative approach with visible light. The team also discussed the design of the circuit board and the need to look into other manufacturers if their current options are limited. Additionally, they talked about the unique features they want to include in the remote, such as voice command and a touch screen.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've said, earlier today we were given incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Morneau say about the debt?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was asked by Pierre Poilievre about the total debt of the Government of Canada. Morneau responded that the government's approach is to continue to make investments on behalf of Canadians, which is possible because of the government's strong fiscal position. He also stated that the negative net worth of the Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, but he did not provide a direct answer to Poilievre's question about the current size of the national debt.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": -1.267958164215088}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": -0.18495334684848785}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Fin", "logprob": -2.578889846801758}, {"text": "ance", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Minister", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Bill", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mor", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ne", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "au", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "was", "logprob": -0.29935985803604126}, {"text": "asked", "logprob": -0.1602240949869156}, {"text": "by", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Pierre", "logprob": -0.2302851378917694}, {"text": "Po", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "il", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "iev", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "re", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "about", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "total", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "deb", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "t", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Government", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Canada", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mor", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ne", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "au", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "respond", "logprob": -2.142551898956299}, {"text": "ed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -0.4121544063091278}, {"text": "government", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "'", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "s", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "approach", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "is", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "continue", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "make", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "invest", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ments", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "beh", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "alf", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Canad", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ians", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "which", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "is", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "possible", "logprob": -0.18645784258842468}, {"text": "because", "logprob": -1.1905906200408936}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "government", "logprob": -0.14267508685588837}, {"text": "'", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "s", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "strong", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "fis", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cal", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "position", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "He", "logprob": -0.691859781742096}, {"text": "also", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "stated", "logprob": -1.7190626859664917}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "negative", "logprob": -0.8936716914176941}, {"text": "net", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "worth", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Government", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Canada", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "will", "logprob": -0.6194696426391602}, {"text": "be", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "as", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "much", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "as", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "$", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "1", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "tr", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ill", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ion", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "by", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "end", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "fis", "logprob": -1.126285433769226}, {"text": "cal", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "year", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "but", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "he", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "did", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provide", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "direct", "logprob": -0.125060573220253}, {"text": "answer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Po", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "il", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "iev", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "re", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "'", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "s", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "question", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "about", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "current", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "size", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "national", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "deb", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "t", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["Morneau explained that the government was committed to supporting Canadians.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'mUK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize their discussions on pay dispute situations.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the committee discussed the issue of teacher training and recruitment, particularly in light of the ongoing pay dispute in the education sector. The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, provided an update on the situation, stating that the Welsh Government is aware of the position taken by ColegauCymru regarding the pay award, and that they are waiting to see if the situation arises where additional funding is needed to meet a commensurate pay award. No definitive action was taken during the meeting to address the pay dispute, but officials will continue to engage with the UK Government to explore a UK-wide approach to the issue.",

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndmy beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

Mike - one ?\nPhD B: Ah .\nProfessor D: We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal .the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the meeting\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the attendees discussed their experiments on noise robustness and shared their results.

Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of amonths, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What were the three main causes for the financial challenges facing the universities?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to Dr. David Blaney, the three main causes of the financial challenges facing universities in Wales are: (1) a decline in the number of 18-year-olds in the population, resulting in a decrease in the number of students entering higher education;

Let's go .\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Finish meeting now .\nProject Manager: Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so\nUser Interface: We'll stay here ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . Oh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Message ?\nUser Interface: Or we'll get the email .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ?\nProject Manager: No , get away . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ? Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Guess so .\nProject Manager: Um I I'm not sure . Maybe you {disfmarker} Yeah . Well you'll have to work on this one .\nUser Interface: Well we'll wait a few seconds\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface: and then we'll get an email .\nMarketing: Alright . Have fun lads .\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A happy hol happy holidays . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Good luck . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} but you can scratch it off or something .

What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for thatlittle more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the meeting\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the participants discussed various topics related to speech recognition, including TORRENT chips, status reports, and subspace models.

So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And charging their remote ,\nMarketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing: Yay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved andfor rubber , we think uh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer: Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing: Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager: Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing: Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager: I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager: On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager: In the centre ,\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah , sure .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager: Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface: we need to {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the decision discussion about key remote control concepts.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it appears that the team has discussed and narrowed down the key remote control concepts to include a simple battery, advanced chip, curved case with a folded design, push-buttons, and an LCD display with a spinning wheel for navigating through menus.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProfessor E: So . OK . Doesn't look like it crashed . That 's great .\nGrad G: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .\nPostdoc B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?\nPhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing .\nPostdoc B: I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}\nGrad G: No .\nPostdoc B: I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?\nGrad G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nGrad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .\nProfessor E: And start by giving the transcript number .\nPhD A: Tran\nPhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .\nPhD A: Oh sorry , go ahead .\nProfessor E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .\nGrad H: OK .\nProfessor E: It 's just uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H: Umh .\nProfessor E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .\nGrad G: And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some\nGrad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: like some other noise .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel theyhere right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'llau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the debate about government giving money to companies which did not put the amount into proper use?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the Hon. Anita Anand, Minister of Public Service and Procurement, faced questions from Ms. Jansen regarding the government's procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE). Ms. Jansen expressed concern that the government had ordered 200 million N95 masks, but the number had steadily decreased to 100 million, according to a federal source. Hon. Anand explained that the government had been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets and was exploring ways to assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs. However, Ms. Jansen pressed the minister to answer whether any of the government's orders had been cancelled due to the nationalization of mask manufacturers in China. Hon. Anand assured the committee that despite the global competitive environment, the government's supply chains were operating and that over 40 flights had brought masks and other supplies into Canada.",

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takesyou but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , see you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Project Manager think of the advanced technology design when presenting the technical functions?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Project Manager believed the design should incorporate color and the company's standard slogan due to the new technology's outdated nature, making it more complex.

And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Grad E contribute to the discussion on storage disks?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Grad E did not contribute to the discussion on storage disks in the meeting transcript provided.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Are you sure I got it all {disfmarker} head's kinda small .\nUser Interface: How're we placed in terms of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . {gap}\nUser Interface: alright .\nMarketing: We're okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Like that ? Okay , cool .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , I think mine's fallen off .\nUser Interface: It fell {disfmarker} That's why .\nMarketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh okay .\nUser Interface: Ah .\nProject Manager: Okay ? {vocalsound} Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer: Wow .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Very official .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll go from there .\nProject Manager: Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing: Prove it\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing: yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nMarketing: Works for me .\nProject Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: getting into it um\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible andeting: so we're gonna have to be careful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In in\nMarketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager: Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing: Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager: I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} something ,\nMarketing: Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface: I like .\nIndustrial Designer: patent it .\nUser Interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing: Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface: Th\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface: That's cool .\nMarketing: Probably .\nUser Interface: I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager: Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Curves .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing: Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S true .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager: Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing: Euros .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Mm-mm .\nProject Manager: They serve um {disfmarker} right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .\nMarketing: With half an hour ?\nProject Manager: Um . Yes .\nMarketing: 'Kay .

Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important ,\nProject Manager: Less . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and uh same for this one . {vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .\nProject Manager: Well , yeah .\nMarketing: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .\nMarketing: Right . {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .\nIndustrial Designer: Easy to use ?\nProject Manager: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's your ta\nUser Interface: {gap}\nProject Manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .\nMarketing: Yeah , I know .\nProject Manager: Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think we have to go for the first one .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: It's the most important one . So {gap} we have to uh take that one .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy .\nUser Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: We'll see . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device .\nMarketing: Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow , that's real great uh great concept .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it must be very bright , very colourful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People like this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So i set your mind to it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh you think ?\nMarketing: I am told . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Bananas .\nMarketing: Uh furthermore ueting: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What are you doing chief ?\nProject Manager: So , you can uh draw a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I think we have to wait ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nProject Manager: Well I'll get a {disfmarker} I'll get the message .\nIndustrial Designer: until the until the beep goes .\nMarketing: No {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But I don't uh {disfmarker} Do we have to stay here ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , I think uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: or I think we have to return first .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well you'll {disfmarker} Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . {gap}\nUser Interface: Maybe .\nProject Manager: Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates .\nIndustrial Designer: The high powers from above {vocalsound} will have to tell us , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I always have a mouse next to my laptop .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Dream on . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I hate these {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I I don't have a laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , touch-pads , yeah .\nProject Manager: Ugh .\nIndustrial Designer: We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No just kidding . Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too ,\nMarketing: You just have to push harder .\nIndustrial Designer: because it becomes too too too too stressy .\nProject Manager: And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Aha . This has no function . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Half\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: But they do want some gadgets . So that's wha what we're doing .\nMarketing: It's all about cool things .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it will sell .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We will be rich .\nIndustrial Designer: Bless you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well we won't . Our bosses will be rich .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We've done too much in the previous meetings .\nIndustrial Designer: Too much ?\nUser Interface: Yes , we've got nothing to do now . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's not bad , is it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well they uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's good . We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Its the best remote ever .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Pinball .\nProject Manager: Oh {gap} . Oh he's totally off again . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No man .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you have to push harder . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But when I start here , it's here .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So is it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and I don't think that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Nope .\nMarketing: Recalibrate it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We can better uh draw a design on this . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but we can't .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh {vocalsound} goes off again .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Let's go .\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Finish meeting now .\nProject Manager: Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so\nUser Interface: We'll stay here ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . Oh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Message ?\nUser Interface: Or we'll get the email .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ?\nProject Manager: No , get away . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ? Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Guess so .\nProject Manager: Um I I'm not sure . Maybe you {disfmarker} Yeah . Well you'll have to work on this one .\nUser Interface: Well we'll wait a few seconds\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface: and then we'll get an email .\nMarketing: Alright . Have fun lads .\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A happy hol happy holidays . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Good luck . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} but you can scratch it off or something .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ?

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite u\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys .

Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmuch as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did PhD B approach the back-end of the Aurora recognizer?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, PhD B approached the back-end of the Aurora recognizer by working on the LDA tuning, trying to find filters with shorter delays, and working on the on-line normalization.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'llspeak.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the discussion about imports and supply chains?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the discussion centered around the importation and supply chains of personal protective equipment (PPE), specifically N95 masks. The Acting Chair mentioned that the government has been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE for front-line healthcare workers. However, the member for Cloverdale-Langley City, Mrs. Tamara Jansen, questioned why the number of N95 masks ordered on the department's website has steadily decreased, suggesting that contracts may have been cancelled due to the nationalization of mask manufacturers in China. The Minister of Public Services and Procurement, Hon. Anita Anand, assured the House that the government has multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, and that despite the global competitive environment, supply chains are operating to ensure the delivery of supplies to Canada.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "During", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the",

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear. What d d d um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good idea .\nProject Manager: Thanks for coming .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Okay, based on the provided meeting transcript, the summary of the meeting is as follows:\n\nThe meeting was called to discuss the design of a new remote control for a television. The team discussed various product requirements, such as teletext, power button, separate channels, volume, and menu. They also discussed the design of the remote control, including the number of buttons and the layout. The team agreed to have a LCD screen on the remote control for easy navigation and to prioritize usability and a nice-looking design. Finally, the team decided to have a lunch break and continue the meeting afterward to work on the conceptual design of the remote control.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0},

Mike - one ?\nPhD B: Ah .\nProfessor D: We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal ., I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the team think about their progress?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the team seems to be satisfied with their progress in the project.

The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up .

What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrialwait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?

So welcome back .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But where ?\nProject Manager: What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager: Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: One more .\nProject Manager: Up .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I had one .\nProject Manager: Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager: Save as {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Desktop .\nProject Manager: Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Project .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager: Save .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: A little later but here it is .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you heard um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager: We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing: Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface: Well a power button ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface: Uh volume .\nProject Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh mine .\nProject Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface: Technical .\nProject Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager: Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface: Mm yes .\nProject Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface: Mute .\nProject Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'llspeak.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the discussion about the seniors care crisis?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, no discussion was held about the seniors care crisis.

So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um {disfmarker} Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we are a {vocalsound} real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I didn't know what company we were ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndbe small or round like buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ?\nProject Manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well if you {vocalsound} you take those th If you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Why go to video ?\nProject Manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: The the video channel uh ?\nUser Interface: That's just zero . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote .\nIndustrial Designer: No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .\nProject Manager: Yes . I don't .\nUser Interface: Yes , I think th\nProject Manager: I go to ninety-nine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No , then you press ninety nine .\nMarketing: Ah uh well whatever , {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th that's the button uh {disfmarker} No .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's easy to go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .\nProject Manager: No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .\nProject Manager: I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels .\nProject Manager: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , I do . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah well y you must have .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah y you you you you have screen width .\nUser Interface: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from {vocalsound} s set frequency o or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . That's the only one we put uh in there .\nProject Manager: So we still {gap} have one uh four ?\nMarketing: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .\nProject Manager: Ch ch\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Programme , right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Oh the Okay button ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .\nUser Interface: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Menu button .\nIndustrial Designer: You should {disfmarker} Yeah . I think that's important .\nProject Manager: Channel , setting , menu .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap} And and the settings to change the brightness {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} We have to go . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Channel , yeah .\nProject Manager: So um Save .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Chief ? Chief ?\nProject Manager: Yes see .\nIndustrial Designer: Th the menu menu button is also important .\nProject Manager: Yes I have put it in .\nIndustrial Designer: Then you can uh {disfmarker} Where ? {vocalsound} I don't see it .\nProject Manager: Here .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh Menu , alright .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu .\nUser Interface: Or the volume or something like that .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Or the volume , yeah .\nProject Manager: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Your pen .\nMarketing: Ah . Great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes chief .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well see you uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ?\nProject Manager: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is this is your thing .\nUser Interface: Yeah , lunch break .\nMarketing: Ah . Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: I am hungry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Lunch .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Get into my belly . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See you later mate . {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group conclude on LCD screens and the speech recognition suggested by Marketing?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the group did not come to a definite conclusion on LCD screens and the speech recognition suggested by Marketing.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkerit's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?

Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um .\nUser Interface: controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: that ask you three {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .\nUser Interface: Sh sure , sure .\nMarketing: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Uh no .\nUser Interface: I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Dash .\nMarketing: And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you can\nProject Manager: yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .\nUser Interface: I once had it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: History . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think we have full of idea .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . {vocalsound} So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .\nMarketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?\nUser Interface: Market Expert .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Marketing {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: Uh that's me .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , of course {vocalsound} yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I'll think of that .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . So .\nMarketing: So ?\nProject Manager: I think that's all .\nMarketing: Meeting's over ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Great .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Thank you .\nProject Manager: See you in thirty minutes .\nUser Interface: Thank you everybody .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the project manager and the team discussed the design of a new remote control for a new project. They brainstormed ideas and narrowed them down to three options: a user-friendly remote control with three buttons, a universal remote control with more than three buttons, and a remote control with a brain that can be controlled by software. The team also discussed the importance of having a history feature, a go back button, and the ability to undo previous actions. Additionally, they talked about the potential for recording sequences of actions and using that information to improve the design of the remote control. The meeting ended with the team agreeing to meet again in 30 minutes to work on these ideas and create a detailed plan for the project.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text":

So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrialwait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the team discuss about the product cost?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the team discussed the cost of the product, specifically the price of the prototype.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: what things to talk about .\nGrad F: I 'm {disfmarker} What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive !\nGrad A: OK , we 're recording .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad B: Check check {pause} check check .\nGrad D: Uh , yeah .\nGrad F: Hello ? Which am I ?\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: Alright . Good .\nGrad F: Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is {disfmarker} on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .\nGrad D: Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} wait .\nGrad F: And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .\nGrad E: This is just one sheet , right ?\nGrad D: Ah ! Just one sheet .\nGrad F: It 's just one sheet .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad F: It 's just a {disfmarker} Nothing else .\nGrad D: Front , back .\nGrad F: Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's very similar to {disfmarker} There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .\nProfessor C: What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad F: So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction\nProfessor C: Oh , I see .\nGrad F: and they have some name .\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct\nGrad F: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: OK , that 's fine .\nGrad F: OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , thentherefore we need everything that {disfmarker} that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the {disfmarker} the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you {disfmarker} we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the {disfmarker} the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be {disfmarker} can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the initial notes . But it 's {disfmarker} in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , {vocalsound} that 'd be kind of funky .\nProfessor C: Um , it sounds to me like you want P R\nGrad A: P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Beca - because it {disfmarker} b because {disfmarker} No , no , you can't . See the {disfmarker} the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can {disfmarker} then you can unfold it .\nGrad A: Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , no , but it matters a lot because you {disfmarker} what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case .\nGrad A: And then {disfmarker} then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} the only way it works .\nProfessor C: Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: \nProfessor C: Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have to see .\nGrad A: But , uh ,\nProfessor C: Uh {disfmarker} Yes . This is {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Except there 's no {disfmarker} no theorem prover involved .\nGrad F: Best explanation .\nProfessor C: No , there isn't a theorem prover but there {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but the , um , The cove the {disfmarker} the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're {disfmarker} you 're coupling a bunch of them together .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm , yeah .\nProfessor C: And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . Uh {disfmarker} Tricky . But you {disfmarker} yeah , it 's a good {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal .\nGrad A: What 's it ?\nProfessor C: So are you gonna write something for us before you go ?\nGrad A: Yes . Um .\nProfessor C: Oh , you have something .\nGrad A: In the process thereof , or whatever .\nProfessor C: OK . So , what 's {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} when are we gonna meet again ?\nGrad F: When are you leaving ?\nGrad A: Fri - uh ,\nGrad F: Thursday , Friday ?\nGrad A: Thursday 's my last day here .\nGrad D: Fri\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: So {disfmarker} I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?\nProfessor C: N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . We {disfmarker} obviously we can {disfmarker} we can do this . But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? Or {disfmarker}\nGrad A: We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah .\nGrad E: Fine with me . Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A: Sure .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad A: Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh {disfmarker} the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And we can make some last minute changes on that .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .\nProfessor C: That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . Yeah , that {disfmarker} Alright .\nGrad F: Can we do {disfmarker} can we do one - thirty ?\nGrad A: No .\nGrad F: Oh , you already told me no .\nGrad A: But we can do four .\nGrad F: One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine . It 's fine .\nGrad A: One or four . I don't care .\nGrad E: To me this is equal . I don't care .\nGrad A: If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ?\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's fine .\nGrad A: Four ?\nGrad F: Fine . Yeah {disfmarker} no , no , no , uh , I don't care . It 's fine .\nGrad A: It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four .\nGrad B: The pressure 's on you Nancy .\nGrad A: Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know {disfmarker} the discussions short .\nGrad F: OK . OK , four .\nGrad E: Well , if you insist , then .\nGrad F: OK ? OK .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?ance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ?

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\n\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

Uh door is closed . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up .\nMarketing: I'm listening .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Great .\nProject Manager: Yo . So . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This one I think .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um {disfmarker} Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} this time we exactly know what to decide about .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright , great .\nProject Manager: And then we'll close again .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker} Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll {vocalsound} first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Walter will uh start again this time ?\nMarketing: Yeah , great .\nProject Manager: Yo .\nMarketing: Alright , Trendwatch .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Uh the trends . {vocalsound} It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but {vocalsound} it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nMarketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important ,\nProject Manager: Less . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and uh same for this one . {vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .\nProject Manager: Well , yeah .\nMarketing: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .\nMarketing: Right . {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .\nIndustrial Designer: Easy to use ?\nProject Manager: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's your ta\nUser Interface: {gap}\nProject Manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .\nMarketing: Yeah , I know .\nProject Manager: Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think we have to go for the first one .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: It's the most important one . So {gap} we have to uh take that one .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy .\nUser Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: We'll see . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device .\nMarketing: Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow , that's real great uh great concept .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it must be very bright , very colourful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People like this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So i set your mind to it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Findings ?

Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too ,\nMarketing: You just have to push harder .\nIndustrial Designer: because it becomes too too too too stressy .\nProject Manager: And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Aha . This has no function . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Half\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: But they do want some gadgets .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And charging their remote ,\nMarketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing: Yay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved anduh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer: Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing: Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager: Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing: Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager: I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager: On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager: In the centre ,\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah , sure .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager: Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface: we need to {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group think of the wood case when discussing the key remote control concepts?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the idea of using a curved on one side case that can be folded in on itself, made out of rubber.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I havehours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why the intensity of demands for the services in the early implementer areas would not be spread across Wales?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the intensity of demand for the services in the early implementer areas is not spread evenly across Wales due to economic and cultural issues. Some areas have a tradition of providing childcare within families, which reduces the need for external childcare services, while other areas have a higher proportion of families who are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales, and therefore are more likely to take advantage of the 48-week childcare offer.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "According", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": -0.10792457312345505}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "intensity", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "demand", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "services", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "in", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "early", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "implement", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "er", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "areas", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "is", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "not", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "spread", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "even", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ly", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "across", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Wales", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "due", "logprob": -0.468206524848938}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "economic", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cultural", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "issues", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Some", "logprob": -1.5589048862457275}, {"text": "areas", "logprob": -0.116970494389534}, {"text": "have", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "tradition", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "providing", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "child", "logprob": -0.16972702741622925}, {"text": "care", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "within", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "families", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "which", "logprob": -0.11113090813159943}, {"text": "reduces", "logprob": -0.22858573496341705}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "need", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "external", "logprob": -0.20428192615509033}, {"text": "child", "logprob": -0.08793807029724121}, {"text": "care", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "services", "logprob": -0.17467015981674194}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "while", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "other", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "areas", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "have", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "higher", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "proportion", "logprob": -0.44262731075286865}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "families", "logprob": -1.1284171342849731}, {"text": "who", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "are", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "below", "logprob": -0.11116685718297958}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "average", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "income", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "£", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "2", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "6", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "0", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "0", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "0", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "in", "logprob": -0.3720705509185791}, {"text": "Wales", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": -0.7195546627044678}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "therefore", "logprob": -0.14688695967197418}, {"text": "are", "logprob": -0.16219405829906464}, {"text": "more", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "likely", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "to", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "take", "logprob": -2.2803430557250977}, {"text": "advantage", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "of", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "", "logprob": -0.6325989961624146}, {"text": "4", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "8", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "-", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "week", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "child", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "care", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "offer", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": 0.0}], "answers": ["Huw Irranca-Davies mentioned there were some economic issues and cultural issues to deal with, rather than the capacity problems."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 14654}
{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProfessor A:  Am I on ? I guess so . Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmuch as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion on improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the participants discussed ways to improve the back recognizer for the Aurora task.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group think of battery design when discussing the functional design of the remote control?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group discussed the issue of battery life and its potential impact on the design of the remote control.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of areport closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill.

This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for fit was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Marketing agree with group mates when discussing the spin wheel with LCD display?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, Marketing agreed with the group mates that the spin wheel with LCD display was \"fairly new\" and \"pretty novel solution for a remote control.\"", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Based", "logprob": -1.200858473777771}, {"text": "on", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "meeting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "trans", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "cript", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "provided", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ",", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "Mark", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "eting", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "agreed", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": -1.0844812393188477}, {"text": "group", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "m", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "ates", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "that", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "the", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "spin", "logprob": -0.4717092514038086}, {"text": "wheel", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "with", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "L", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "CD", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "display", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "was", "logprob": -0.28115010261535645}, {"text": "\"", "logprob": -0.24167856574058533}, {"text": "f", "logprob": -1.9637140035629272}, {"text": "air", "logprob": -0.2951369881629944}, {"text": "ly", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "new", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "\"", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "and", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "\"", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "pre", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "tty", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "novel", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "solution", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "for", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "a", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "remote", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "control", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": ".\"", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "</s>", "logprob": -0.15121398866176605}], "answers": ["User Interface asked whether they could put an additional mute button on the top of the scroll spinning when discussing the scroll wheel push button.

Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up .

What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ?

We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrialwait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding—we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those—. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have—and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with—. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I haveage is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right—sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you—diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did Huw Irranca-Davies ensure the high qualification and quality of the workforce while the rates remained at £4.50?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, Huw Irranca-Davies, the Minister for Children and Social Care in Wales, did not mention any specific measures to ensure the high qualification and quality of the workforce while the rates remained at £4.50.

Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nInd: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about product quotation.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed the product quotation, specifically the design of the product and the costs involved.

OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal .h , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion on future directions\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the participants discussed future directions for the project, including continuing to work on the large training set using French, Spanish, and English, starting feature combination experiments, and combining two feature streams using each MPL.

Ow .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice user interface .\nProject Manager: Yeah . What the {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Yeah well , ja well let's just start .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .\nMarketing: Right let's see it .\nProject Manager: So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . Well {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh {vocalsound} I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in ,\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: and uh hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh sorry . {vocalsound} And {gap} an uh a nice agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So {vocalsound} this the opening we'll uh {disfmarker} We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's {vocalsound} also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh {disfmarker} Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Other uh {disfmarker} There happen to be uh three stages . {gap} functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . {gap} you have a {disfmarker} these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . {vocalsound} This is just a {gap} . I want to uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Of course w {vocalsound} doesn't work any more . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes I will {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Does it ? Yeah . It works .\nProject Manager: eraser {gap} so .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wonderful .\nProject Manager: It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well it's just like a normal uh paint .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it's gone .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright , yep .\nProject Manager: Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: not my idea . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright , your favourite animal ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes our your favourite .

You can use it {vocalsound} just plain\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nMarketing: but you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} To make it more trendy .\nProject Manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yes . Yes .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well you can make profit with them , and it's {vocalsound} a way to make them trendy .\nProject Manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself {vocalsound} so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nUser Interface: Yeah alright {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah normal .\nIndustrial Designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\nUser Interface: No a colour everyone accepts .\nProject Manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Pink television sets {vocalsound} pink remote , {gap} .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {gap} standard .\nMarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black .\nUser Interface: Well young people s li\nMarketing: Yeah but then you can use {vocalsound} a a front .\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well if if you {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .\nProject Manager: Yes . {vocalsound} Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh {gap} I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .\nProject Manager: Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too .\nProject Manager: Euro ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y you went to the company website {gap} .\nMarketing: It's {disfmarker} Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: if you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the the the start uh starting page uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Finish meeting now . Oh alright . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well that's great .\nUser Interface: Next meeting is in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be {disfmarker} you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here .\nUser Interface: Thirty minutes .\nMarketing: Thirty minutes .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright it's it's handy to know {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Very handy to know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's totally broken . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because uh {vocalsound} it's it's the half of the normal size . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right see you in half an hour then .\nProject Manager: Oh right , oh .\nUser Interface: Oh . {vocalsound} Goodbye . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Ma {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: W\nMarketing: Oh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S\nProject Manager: W {vocalsound} that was a nice meeting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , see you . {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group members think of the buttons of the remote control when discussing the desired features of remote control?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the group members discussed the desired features of the remote control, including the buttons.

Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .\nProfessor C: What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad F: So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction\nProfessor C: Oh , I see .\nGrad F: and they have some name .\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct\nGrad F: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: OK , that 's fine .\nGrad F: OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , thenneed everything that {disfmarker} that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the {disfmarker} the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you {disfmarker} we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the {disfmarker} the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be {disfmarker} can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the initial notes . But it 's {disfmarker} in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , {vocalsound} that 'd be kind of funky .\nProfessor C: Um , it sounds to me like you want P R\nGrad A: P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Beca - because it {disfmarker} b because {disfmarker} No , no , you can't . See the {disfmarker} the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can {disfmarker} then you can unfold it .\nGrad A: Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , no , but it matters a lot because you {disfmarker} what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case .\nGrad A: And then {disfmarker} then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} the only way it works .\nProfessor C: Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: \nProfessor C: Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have to see .\nGrad A: But , uh ,\nProfessor C: Uh {disfmarker} Yes . This is {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Except there 's no {disfmarker} no theorem prover involved .\nGrad F: Best explanation .\nProfessor C: No , there isn't a theorem prover but there {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but the , um , The cove the {disfmarker} the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're {disfmarker} you 're coupling a bunch of them together .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm , yeah .\nProfessor C: And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . Uh {disfmarker} Tricky . But you {disfmarker} yeah , it 's a good {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal .\nGrad A: What 's it ?\nProfessor C: So are you gonna write something for us before you go ?\nGrad A: Yes . Um .\nProfessor C: Oh , you have something .\nGrad A: In the process thereof , or whatever .\nProfessor C: OK . So , what 's {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} when are we gonna meet again ?\nGrad F: When are you leaving ?\nGrad A: Fri - uh ,\nGrad F: Thursday , Friday ?\nGrad A: Thursday 's my last day here .\nGrad D: Fri\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: So {disfmarker} I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?\nProfessor C: N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . We {disfmarker} obviously we can {disfmarker} we can do this . But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? Or {disfmarker}\nGrad A: We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah .\nGrad E: Fine with me . Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A: Sure .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad A: Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh {disfmarker} the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And we can make some last minute changes on that .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .\nProfessor C: That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . Yeah , that {disfmarker} Alright .\nGrad F: Can we do {disfmarker} can we do one - thirty ?\nGrad A: No .\nGrad F: Oh , you already told me no .\nGrad A: But we can do four .\nGrad F: One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine . It 's fine .\nGrad A: One or four . I don't care .\nGrad E: To me this is equal . I don't care .\nGrad A: If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ?\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's fine .\nGrad A: Four ?\nGrad F: Fine . Yeah {disfmarker} no , no , no , uh , I don't care . It 's fine .\nGrad A: It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four .\nGrad B: The pressure 's on you Nancy .\nGrad A: Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know {disfmarker} the discussions short .\nGrad F: OK . OK , four .\nGrad E: Well , if you insist , then .\nGrad F: OK ? OK . I am .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How would the mental spaces operate?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, it appears that the mental spaces would operate as follows:\n\n1. Constructional Specification: Grad F has created a sheet with two sides, one containing a revised semantic specification and the other with a revised construction formalism. The sheet is intended to provide a way to specify constructions in a more formal and systematic manner, allowing for more consistent and reliable usage of mental spaces.\n2. Type System: Grad F suggests that each construction could have a type, which would be specified before the construction. This type system would help to ensure that constructions are used correctly and consistently, and would allow for more flexible and expressive usage of mental spaces.\n3. Meaning and Form: Grad F also suggests that there could be a distinction between \"meaning\" and \"form\" in the context of mental spaces. This would allow for more precise and flexible specification of the meanings and forms of constructions, and would help to ensure that mental spaces are used consistently and accurately.\n4. Situation-Dependent Modules: Grad A suggests that the mental spaces could be situation-dependent, meaning that the modules and rules for constructing sentences would vary depending on the context in which they are used. This would allow for more flexible and adaptive usage of mental spaces, and would help to ensure that they are used effectively and efficiently.\n\nOverall, the mental spaces would operate by providing a systematic and formal way of specifying constructions, and by allowing for more flexible and adaptive usage of these constructions depending on the context in which they are used.",

Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hvocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the marketing learn about the functions that users often used when discussing user requirements?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the meeting transcript, the marketing expert learned that users often use the \"Zap\" function in remote controls frequently, and they would like to see a more user-friendly design for this feature.

Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ?

That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\n\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record. Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did B think about the experimental setup of the computer navigation system?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, B expressed some concerns about the experimental setup of the computer navigation system.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: what things to talk about .\nGrad F: I 'm {disfmarker} What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive !\nGrad A: OK , we 're recording .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad B: Check check {pause} check check .\nGrad D: Uh , yeah .\nGrad F: Hello ? Which am I ?\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: Alright . Good .\nGrad F: Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is {disfmarker} on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .\nGrad D: Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} wait .\nGrad F: And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .\nGrad E: This is just one sheet , right ?\nGrad D: Ah ! Just one sheet .\nGrad F: It 's just one sheet .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad F: It 's just a {disfmarker} Nothing else .\nGrad D: Front , back .\nGrad F: Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's very similar to {disfmarker} There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .\nProfessor C: What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad F: So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction\nProfessor C: Oh , I see .\nGrad F: and they have some name .\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct\nGrad F: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: OK , that 's fine .\nGrad F: OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , thenfmarker} that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the {disfmarker} the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you {disfmarker} we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the {disfmarker} the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be {disfmarker} can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the initial notes . But it 's {disfmarker} in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , {vocalsound} that 'd be kind of funky .\nProfessor C: Um , it sounds to me like you want P R\nGrad A: P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Beca - because it {disfmarker} b because {disfmarker} No , no , you can't . See the {disfmarker} the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can {disfmarker} then you can unfold it .\nGrad A: Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , no , but it matters a lot because you {disfmarker} what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case .\nGrad A: And then {disfmarker} then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} the only way it works .\nProfessor C: Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: \nProfessor C: Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have to see .\nGrad A: But , uh ,\nProfessor C: Uh {disfmarker} Yes . This is {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Except there 's no {disfmarker} no theorem prover involved .\nGrad F: Best explanation .\nProfessor C: No , there isn't a theorem prover but there {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but the , um , The cove the {disfmarker} the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're {disfmarker} you 're coupling a bunch of them together .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm , yeah .\nProfessor C: And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . Uh {disfmarker} Tricky . But you {disfmarker} yeah , it 's a good {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal .\nGrad A: What 's it ?\nProfessor C: So are you gonna write something for us before you go ?\nGrad A: Yes . Um .\nProfessor C: Oh , you have something .\nGrad A: In the process thereof , or whatever .\nProfessor C: OK . So , what 's {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} when are we gonna meet again ?\nGrad F: When are you leaving ?\nGrad A: Fri - uh ,\nGrad F: Thursday , Friday ?\nGrad A: Thursday 's my last day here .\nGrad D: Fri\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: So {disfmarker} I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?\nProfessor C: N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . We {disfmarker} obviously we can {disfmarker} we can do this . But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? Or {disfmarker}\nGrad A: We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah .\nGrad E: Fine with me . Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A: Sure .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad A: Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh {disfmarker} the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And we can make some last minute changes on that .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .\nProfessor C: That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . Yeah , that {disfmarker} Alright .\nGrad F: Can we do {disfmarker} can we do one - thirty ?\nGrad A: No .\nGrad F: Oh , you already told me no .\nGrad A: But we can do four .\nGrad F: One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine . It 's fine .\nGrad A: One or four . I don't care .\nGrad E: To me this is equal . I don't care .\nGrad A: If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ?\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's fine .\nGrad A: Four ?\nGrad F: Fine . Yeah {disfmarker} no , no , no , uh , I don't care . It 's fine .\nGrad A: It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four .\nGrad B: The pressure 's on you Nancy .\nGrad A: Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know {disfmarker} the discussions short .\nGrad F: OK . OK , four .\nGrad E: Well , if you insist , then .\nGrad F: OK ? OK . I am .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What is the description of the domains in the mental spaces?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " In the meeting transcript provided, the Grad F member is recording the discussion and sharing their thoughts and justifications for comments on the sheet they have provided.

So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial, wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Okay, based on the provided meeting transcript, the summary of the whole meeting is as follows:\n\nThe project manager, marketer, and industrial designer gathered to discuss the prototype of a new remote control.

And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarkersell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What policy the government was going to roll out to ease the deficit?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, the government was not going to roll out any policies to ease the deficit.

You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . {gap} you have a {disfmarker} these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . {vocalsound} This is just a {gap} . I want to uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Of course w {vocalsound} doesn't work any more . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes I will {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Does it ? Yeah . It works .\nProject Manager: eraser {gap} so .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wonderful .\nProject Manager: It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well it's just like a normal uh paint .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it's gone .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright , yep .\nProject Manager: Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: not my idea . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright , your favourite animal ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Grizzly bear . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: w I dunno what I'm going to design .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh um {vocalsound} doesn't {disfmarker} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Project Manager: China rules . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And have {disfmarker} well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . {vocalsound} The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But are {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: but that's pretty obvious , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?\nProject Manager: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .\nMarketing: I think {vocalsound} we should make it universal\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it {vocalsound} just plain\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nMarketing: but you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} To make it more trendy .\nProject Manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yes . Yes .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well you can make profit with them , and it's {vocalsound} a way to make them trendy .\nProject Manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself {vocalsound} so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nUser Interface: Yeah alright {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah normal .\nIndustrial Designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\nUser Interface: No a colour everyone accepts .\nProject Manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Pink television sets {vocalsound} pink remote , {gap} .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {gap} standard .\nMarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black .\nUser Interface: Well young people s li\nMarketing: Yeah but then you can use {vocalsound} a a front .\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well if if you {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .\nProject Manager: Yes . {vocalsound} Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh {gap} I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .\nProject Manager: Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too .\nProject Manager: Euro ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y you went to the company website {gap} .\nMarketing: It's {disfmarker} Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: if you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the the the start uh starting page uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Finish meeting now . Oh alright . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well that's great .\nUser Interface: Next meeting is in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be {disfmarker} you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here .\nUser Interface: Thirty minutes .\nMarketing: Thirty minutes .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright it's it's handy to know {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Very handy to know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's totally broken . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because uh {vocalsound} it's it's the half of the normal size . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right see you in half an hour then .\nProject Manager: Oh right , oh .\nUser Interface: Oh . {vocalsound} Goodbye . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Ma {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: W\nMarketing: Oh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S\nProject Manager: W {vocalsound} that was a nice meeting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , see you . {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the group's plan of their marketing strategy.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript, the group plans to design a new television remote control with a modern and trendy design, making it universal and easy to use.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , pinball .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nUser Interface: Mine . Oh , great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Large .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .apest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting .

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen: That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney: Thank you.\nBethan Owen: Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was Bethan Owen's comment towards the high-risk category?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Bethan Owen mentioned that the Reid recommendations are important because they provide a vision for how to respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds.

Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-halsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about how to select channels.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the team discussed how to select channels for the new remote control project.

Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and recordunpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did A think about setting up the recording equipment?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " According to the transcript, A thought it was a good idea to set up the recording equipment and was willing to do it.

Ow .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice user interface .\nProject Manager: Yeah . What the {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Yeah well , ja well let's just start .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .\nMarketing: Right let's see it .\nProject Manager: So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . Well {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh {vocalsound} I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in ,\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: and uh hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh sorry . {vocalsound} And {gap} an uh a nice agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So {vocalsound} this the opening we'll uh {disfmarker} We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's {vocalsound} also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh {disfmarker} Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Other uh {disfmarker} There happen to be uh three stages . {gap} functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . {gap} you have a {disfmarker} these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . {vocalsound} This is just a {gap} . I want to uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Of course w {vocalsound} doesn't work any more . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes I will {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Does it ? Yeah . It works .\nProject Manager: eraser {gap} so .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wonderful .\nProject Manager: It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well it's just like a normal uh paint .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it's gone .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright , yep .\nProject Manager: Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: not my idea . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright , your favourite animal ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Grizzly bear . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: w I dunno what I'm going to design .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh um {vocalsound} doesn't {disfmarker} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager: China rules . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And have {disfmarker} well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . {vocalsound} The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But are {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: but that's pretty obvious , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?\nProject Manager: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .\nMarketing: I think {vocalsound} we should make it universal\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it {vocalsound} just plain\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nMarketing: but you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} To make it more trendy .\nProject Manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: Yes . Yes .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well you can make profit with them , and it's {vocalsound} a way to make them trendy .\nProject Manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself {vocalsound} so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nUser Interface: Yeah alright {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Yeah right .\nUser Interface: Yeah normal .\nIndustrial Designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\nUser Interface: No a colour everyone accepts .\nProject Manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Pink television sets {vocalsound} pink remote , {gap} .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {gap} standard .\nMarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black .\nUser Interface: Well young people s li\nMarketing: Yeah but then you can use {vocalsound} a a front .\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well if if you {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .\nProject Manager: Yes . {vocalsound} Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh {gap} I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .\nProject Manager: Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too .\nProject Manager: Euro ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y you went to the company website {gap} .\nMarketing: It's {disfmarker} Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: if you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the the the start uh starting page uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Finish meeting now . Oh alright . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well that's great .\nUser Interface: Next meeting is in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be {disfmarker} you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here .\nUser Interface: Thirty minutes .\nMarketing: Thirty minutes .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright it's it's handy to know {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Very handy to know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's totally broken . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because uh {vocalsound} it's it's the half of the normal size . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right see you in half an hour then .\nProject Manager: Oh right , oh .\nUser Interface: Oh . {vocalsound} Goodbye . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Ma {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: W\nMarketing: Oh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S\nProject Manager: W {vocalsound} that was a nice meeting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , see you . {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " During the meeting, the project manager and the team discussed the design of a new television remote control.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me—what the research does show—that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that—there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity—. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put—. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.] My understanding is—\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee—. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions—\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites say to you, 'Unless you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself—\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just—final question—with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private. Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Kirsty Williams say about the trend of teacher recruiting, the reasons for it, and the steps they had taken?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that while the trend of teacher recruiting in Wales was concerning, it was not unique to Wales and was a common issue globally. She explained that financial incentives were not the only factor influencing the decision to become a teacher, and that the issue required a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind it. To address the issue, the Welsh government had established an advisory group to understand the problem and had introduced various measures, including an increase in employment-based routes to qualified teacher status, a part-time PGCE route, and a unique approach to teacher training.", "completions_tokens": [{"text": "", "logprob": 0.0}, {"text": "K", "logprob": -0.11620324850082397},

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise.

Oops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , pinball .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nMarketing: Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nUser Interface: Mine . Oh , great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Large .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Like this .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager: No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S okay .\nUser Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: That was that .\nProject Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing: {gap} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red .cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Bye bye .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the team discuss about the use of advanced chips and LCD display?\nAnswer:[/INST]", "pred": " Based on the meeting transcript provided, the team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD displays for their remote control design.
