Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nTrusty system (prison)\nThe \"trusty system\" (sometimes incorrectly called \"trustee system\") was a penitentiary system of discipline and security enforced in parts of the United States until the 1980s, in which designated inmates were given various privileges, abilities, and responsibilities not available to all inmates.It was made compulsory under Mississippi state law but was used in other states as well, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, New York and Texas. The method of controlling and working inmates at Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman was designed in 1901 to replace convict leasing. The case Gates v. Collier ended the flagrant abuse of inmates under the trusty system and other prison abuses that had continued essentially unchanged since the building of the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Other states using the trusty system were also forced to give it up under the ruling.\n\nHistory\nPrisons had trusties as far back as the 1800s.\n\nParchman Farm\nThe prison had approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2) of farmland and grew such cash crops as cotton as well as engaged in livestock production. Although the population of the prison was around 1,900 inmates (two thirds of whom were black and in racially-segregated units), the law allowed only a maximum of 150 staff members to be hired to minimize operating costs. Thus, the farm labor was done by inmates.The bulk of guarding and disciplining of the inmates was performed by inmate trusties. They also performed most of the administrative work, supervised by a few employees. Therefore, the inmate trusties essentially controlled inmate care and custody, basically running the prison system.Highest in the prison inmate hierarchy were the inmates armed with rifles, called the \"trusty shooters\". Their job was to act as prison guards and control other inmates on a day-to-day basis in the residential camps or out on the field work crews. Next came the unarmed trusties who performed janitorial, clerical, and other menial tasks for the prison's staff. Simple tasks, such as distributing medication, were carried out by other categories of inmates such as \"hallboys\". Inmate trusties enforced discipline within the prison inmate living quarters (16 different residential camps) and in the work camps and prison farms. In addition to punishment administered on site, inmate trusties could recommend further punishment in the special punishment area for disobedient or disruptive inmates.According to attorney Roy Haber, who handled the series of litigation cases brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the trusty system, inmates were whipped with leather straps for failing to pick their daily quota of cotton. The farm's camps of black inmates were supervised by one white sergeant, and under him the black inmate \"trusty shooters\", who were serving sentences for murder, carried rifles and enforced discipline.\n\nAbolition\nGates v. Collier (Gates v. Collier Prison Reform Case, 1970–1971) ended the flagrant abuse of inmates under the trusty system and other prison abuses that had continued essentially unchanged since the building of the prison in 1903. On October 20, 1972, Federal Judge William Keady ordered the end of racial segregation in prison residential quarters. He also required replacement of trusty shooters with civilian prison guards.Any system in which inmates were allowed to be in a position of authority and control other inmates or to use physical abuse or intimidation of other inmates was abolished. It also found some types of corporal punishment were a violation of an inmate's Eighth Amendment rights, including \"handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for, long periods of time,... and forcing inmates to stand, sit or lie on crates, stumps, or otherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods.\"Its structure and abuses were detailed in Hope v. Pelzer in which a former inmate sued the prison superintendent for personal injury suffered under the trusty system.Other states using the trusty system, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas were also forced to abolish it under the Gates v. Collier rulings. However, some states, such as Texas, still continued their use of trusty systems (known as \"building tenders\") until the 1980s, when Federal Judge William Wayne Justice, in Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265 (S.D. Tex. 1980), compelled the replacement of the trusty system with the strictly-regulated Support Service Inmate (SSI) system.\n\nSee also\n\"Parchman Farm\" (song)\nLouisiana State Penitentiary\nKapo\nPassage 2:\nBrockmeyer v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet\nBrockmeyer v. Dun & Bradstreet 113 Wis. 2d 561, 335 N.W.2d 834 (Wis. 1983), was a case in which the Wisconsin Supreme Court first identified that Wisconsin has some judicial exceptions to the employment at will doctrine.\n\nFacts\nCharles J. Brockmeyer was employed at investment firm Dun & Bradstreet as a district manager of credit services, though he lacked a formal employment contract. After the employer settled a sex discrimination suit filed by the employee's former secretary, with whom he allegedly had an affair, the employer fired the employee. The court held that it was appropriate to create a public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine, as the termination had clearly violated a well-defined public policy, as evidenced by existing law. While the employer's actions may have constituted bad faith, they did not contravene the policies of any statute or constitutional provision. As the employee failed to prove that his discharge violated fundamental public policy, the decision for the employer was appropriate.\n\nHolding\nThe court affirmed the decision of the lower court in favor of the employer.\n\nCitations\nThe case is cited in Bammert v. Don's Super Valu, Inc.\nPassage 3:\nMiller v. California\nMiller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court modifying its definition of obscenity from that of \"utterly without socially redeeming value\" to that which lacks \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\". It is now referred to as the three-prong standard or the Miller test.\n\nBackground\nIn 1971, Marvin Miller, an owner/operator of a California mail-order business specializing in pornographic films and books, sent out a brochure advertising books and a film that graphically depicted sexual activity between men and women. The brochure used in the mailing contained graphic images from the books and the film. Five of the brochures were mailed to a restaurant in Newport Beach, California. The owner and his mother opened the envelope and seeing the brochures, called the police.Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and by 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1994. The complaint stated that African American inmates had been segregated and discriminated against based on their race, which is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint aimed for injunctive relief to remedy the alleged misconduct of the defendants and a declaratory judgment that the continuation of certain practices and conditions at the penitentiary is unconstitutional\".According to a section of the Preliminary Statement, \"On August 23, 1971, the United States was allowed to intervene as plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2.[2] The complaint in intervention alleges that the defendants have, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, maintained a system of prison facilities segregated by race; and, additionally, the defendants have failed to provide the inmates with adequate housing, medical care, and protection from assault from other prisoners; that the conditions of the sewerage disposal and water systems create an immediate health hazard, and that prison officials have permitted the custodial staff, including inadequately trained armed trusties, to inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon inmates in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The United States seeks injunctive relief to remedy the alleged misconduct of defendants\".In October 1972, Judge William Keady found for the plaintiffs, calling Parchman Farm an \"affront to modern standards of decency\" and its living quarters \"unfit for human habitation.\" He ordered an end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices.\n\nFifth Circuit decision\nThe state of Mississippi appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, though the Fifth Circuit ended up agreeing with the lower court's earlier decision. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished as well as the trusty system.Subsequently, other states utilizing the trusty system, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas were also forced to abolish it under the Gates v. Collier rulings.\n\nSee also\nLouisiana State Penitentiary\nCummins Unit - Arkansas and Texas\nPervear v. Massachusetts\nHolt v. Sarver\nRuiz v. Estelle - Texas\nHope v.

The Court ruled that judges may imply terms into a contract based on the past dealings of the parties rather than void the agreement.\nLord Wright stated in this case that people who give good consideration can bind themselves to a duty to negotiate in good faith, but this view was controversially rejected in a later House of Lords case, Walford v Miles (1992).Hillas & Company were merchants purchasing timber from Arcos. Hillas and Arcos reached an agreement to purchase 22,000 standards of timber, under the specific condition that they should also have the option of entering into a contract with Arcos to purchase 100,000 standards the following year with a 5% reduction on price. Arcos refused to sell them the 100,000 standards the following year. Hillas was successful at trial, which Arcos appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal.\n\nSee also\nG Scammell & Nephew Ltd v Ouston [1941] 1 AC 251\nSmith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597\nHartog v Colin & Shields [1939] 3 All ER 566\nFrederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William H Pim Junior & Co Ltd [1953] 2 QB 450\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nFull text of decision from Bailii.org\nPassage 10:\nFletcher v. Peck\nFletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in which the Supreme Court first ruled a state law unconstitutional. The decision created a growing precedent for the sanctity of legal contracts and hinted that Native Americans did not hold complete title to their own lands (an idea fully realized in Johnson v. McIntosh).\n\nYazoo lands sales\nFollowing the Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolution, Georgia claimed possession of the Yazoo lands, a 54,000 sq mi (140,000 km2) region of the Indian Reserve, west of its own territory. The land later became the northern part of the states of Alabama and Mississippi.\nIn 1795, the Georgia legislature divided the area into four tracts. The state then sold the tracts to four separate land development companies for $500,000, about $0.014 per acre, a bargain even at 1790 prices. The Georgia legislature overwhelmingly approved this land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. However, it was later revealed that the Yazoo Land Act had been approved in return for bribes in a scandal known as the Yazoo Land Scandal. The voters rejected most of the incumbents in the next election; the new legislature, reacting to the public outcry, repealed the law and voided the transactions made under it.\nRobert Fletcher and especially John Peck were speculators in the Yazoo lands. Fletcher bought a tract of land from Peck after the 1795 act was repealed. Fletcher, in 1803, brought a suit against Peck, claiming that Peck had not had clear title to the land when he sold it.\nThere was collusion between the two. Both would have their land secured if the Supreme Court decided that Native Americans did not hold original title. Fletcher set out to win the case.\n\nCourt ruling\nThe Supreme Court unanimously (with a separate concurring opinion written by William Johnson) ruled that the legislature's repeal of the law was unconstitutional. John Marshall wrote that the sale was a binding contract, which under Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated even if it is illegally secured.\nThe ruling lent further protection to property rights against popular pressure and is the earliest case of the Court asserting its right to invalidate state laws which are in conflict with or are otherwise contrary to the Constitution. A later Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist, wrote that Fletcher v. Peck \"represented an attempt by Chief Justice Marshall to extend the protection of the contract clause to infant business\".\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 10\nYazoo land scandal\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThe Real Glory\nThe Real Glory is a 1939 Samuel Goldwyn Productions adventure film starring Gary Cooper, David Niven, Andrea Leeds and Broderick Crawford released by United Artists in the weeks immediately following Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. Based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford and directed by Henry Hathaway, the film is set against the backdrop of the Moro Rebellion during the American occupation of the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century. According to The World news broadcast on Aug 18, 2017, the US War Department withdrew the film in 1942. The Moros were US allies in World War II, and the film had inflammatory scenes including threatening a Muslim prisoner with burial wrapped in a pig skin.\n\nPlot\nIn 1906, Alipang (Tetsu Komai) and his Muslim Moro guerrillas are terrorizing the people of the Philippine island of Mindanao, raiding villages, killing the men, and carrying off the women and children for slaves. Instead of maintaining garrisons indefinitely to protect the Filipinos, the U.S. army tests out a new tactic at Fort Mysang. The army detachment is replaced by a handful of officers – Colonel Hatch (Roy Gordon), Captains Manning (Russell Hicks) and Hartley (Reginald Owen), and Lieutenants McCool (David Niven) and Larsen (Broderick Crawford) – who are to train the native Philippine Constabulary to take over the burden. Army doctor Lieutenant Canavan (Gary Cooper) is sent along to keep them healthy. They are welcomed by a skeptical Padre Rafael (Charles Waldron).\nAlipang starts sending fanatical juramentados to assassinate the officers and goad them into attacking before the natives are fully trained. Hatch is the first victim, leaving Manning to take command. Manning's wife (Kay Johnson) and Hartley's daughter Linda (Andrea Leeds) arrive for a visit at the worst possible time; a horrified Mrs. Manning witnesses her husband's murder. Hartley takes charge, but Canavan disagrees with his by-the-book, overcautious approach. Disobeying orders, Canavan sets out for Alipang's camp guided by Miguel (Benny Inocencio), a young Moro boy he has befriended. \"Mike\" (as Canavan calls him) infiltrates the camp and learns that Alipang has sent another assassin, this time for Hartley. Canavan and Mike intercept the man and take him back a prisoner.\nLinda and Canavan fall in love, much to the disappointment of McCool and Larsen. When Hartley insists she leave Mysang with Mrs. Manning, she refuses and helps out at the hospital.\nAlipang then dams the river on which the villagers depend. Hartley refuses to send a detachment into the jungle to blow it up (he is concealing the fact that he is slowly going blind from an old head wound). The people have to rely on an old well, but the contaminated water causes a cholera epidemic. Finally, Hartley has no choice but to send Larsen and some men to destroy the dam. They do not return.\nThe Datu (Vladimir Sokoloff), a supposedly friendly Moro leader, offers to guide Hartley and his men to the dam, but he is actually leading them into an ambush. Canavan learns of the Datu's treachery from Mike, the sole survivor of Larsen's detachment, and races to warn Hartley. Canavan forces the Datu to take him to the dam. The Datu is killed in a booby trap, but Canavan manages to dynamite the dam anyway. Then, he and the men raft back to the village, which is under attack by Alipang's men.\nMcCool is killed leading the defense, but Canavan and the rest return in time to turn the tide. Alipang is killed by Filipino Lieutenant Yabo (Rudy Robles). Their mission accomplished, the Hartleys and Canavan depart, leaving the village in Yabo's care.\n\nCast\nGary Cooper as Dr. Bill Canavan\nDavid Niven as Lieutenant Terence McCool\nAndrea Leeds as Linda Hartley\nReginald Owen as Captain Steve Hartley\nBroderick Crawford as Lieutenant Larsen.

It was unsure who the star would be – possibilities included Joel McCrea and Gary Cooper, who both had deals with Goldwyn – but Walter Brennan was announced as the second lead. Goldwyn sought a meeting with Philippines President Quezon to get his government's co operation to make the film. Goldwyn wanted to make the film in color.In June 1938 Goldwyn signed a contract with Paramount to borrow director Henry Hathaway for three films, the first of which was to be The Real Glory. Goldwyn assigned Gary Cooper to star as he and Hathaway had successfully made Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935) together. The film was also known as The Last Frontier. Cooper was placed under exclusive contract to Goldwyn.Filming took place in April 1939. There were considerable troubles finding and managing the Filipino extras. Reginald Owen replaced Donald Crisp.\nThe Philippine government reportedly requested changes to the film, due to the depiction of Philippine soldiers as cowards, which were denied. However the government later said they made no such suggestions.\n\nBurial in a pig skin\nIn one scene Padre Rafael tells Dr. Canavan that the Moros are afraid of burial in a pig skin. In a later scene Dr. Canavan threatens Moro prisoner with this, and a pig skin is laid on the ground in front of the prisoner. This episode echoes a report in General Pershing's memoir My Life Before the World War that a Muslim fighter had been \"publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig\". There is a related, but widely discredited, claim that Pershing had threatened to execute Muslim Moro prisoners with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. The historian Brian M. Linn wrote that it was unlikely that Pershing was involved in or had ordered others to commit religiously insulting acts, and that the episode in The Real Glory had probably fuelled the myth. This claim concerning bullets dipped in pigs' blood was referred to by Donald Trump in a presidential campaign speech in February 2016 and in a tweet following the terrorist attacks in Barcelona on August 17, 2017. On the other hand, evidence from Rear Admiral Danial P. Maddox,2011–2012, the Banque Populaire V skippered by Loïck Peyron covered 811.70 nautical miles in 24 hours on 3 December 2011 at 11:45 UT, posting 28 days over 600 miles, including 9 days over 700 miles and 1 day over 800 miles.During her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2009–2010, the trimaran Groupama 3 skippered by Franck Cammas covered 798 nautical miles in 24 hours on 13 February 2010 at 5 p.m. UT, showing 17 days over 600 miles, including 10 days over 700 miles.\nDuring her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2016–2017, the trimaran Idec sport skippered by Francis Joyon covered 894 nautical miles in 24 hours, and 10 consecutive days at 809 miles / 24 h. Francis Joyon rounds Cape Horn, 16 days after riding off of South America, and after a course of nearly 12,000 miles above an average of 30 knots (730.16 miles / 24 h over 16 days). He then signs a performance increase of between 30 and 40% compared to the record to be broken by Loïck Peyron 5 years earlier. Leaving the southern seas with a lead of 4 j 06 h 35 min over Loïck Peyron's previous record, Francis Joyon and his crew regained the equivalent of 2,800 miles on the record during this episode.\nDuring the aborted attempt of 2019, Yann Guichard sets a new record crossing the equator in 4 days 19 h 57 min and, thanks to favorable weather conditions, lines up 4,812.1 miles from the 11th to 16th day, or 802 miles / day for 6 consecutive days.\nDuring his record around the world Singlehanded in 2017, 24 hour distance record for François Gabart on Macif: 850,68 miles in 24h.During his attempt for the Jules Verne Trophy on December 5, 2020, Thomas Coville on fr:Sodebo Ultim 3 covered 889.9 miles in 24 hours (37.1 knots average, top speed 48.9 knots).\n\nPassage records\nIntermediate records\nFailed record attempts\nThe trophy\nThe \"Trophy Jules Verne\" was the subject of a public order of the visual arts delegation with the American artist Tom Shannon and is patroned by the French Ministry of Culture.The work is a floating hull on a magnetic field, much as an anchorage for a ship. All dimensions have rigorous symbolic meaning. The midship beam of the hull corresponds to the diameter of the Earth, the ray of each end is proportional to that of the moon and the radius of the curvature of the frames is that of the sun. The competitors of the Trophy Jules Verne race around the Earth against time, with only the sun and the moon as companions and time keepers.\nThe sculpture is placed on a cast aluminium base, on which the names of the sailors having won the Trophy are engraved. The Musée national de la Marine in Paris hosts and maintains the Trophy. Each winner receives a miniature of the Trophy, magnetized like the original one.\nWhen a record is broken, an official ceremony is held for the previous record holders to hand over the trophy to the new record holders, who are given the hull and must place it in its magnetic field mooring.\n\nSee also\nCircumnavigation\nList of circumnavigations\nList of youth solo sailing circumnavigations\nAround the world in 80 daysCompetitions and prizes\nGlobal Challenge\nJules Verne Trophy\nThe race\nOryx Quest\nVendée GlobeOther speed sailing records\nSpeed sailing record\nWorld Sailing Speed Record Council\nTransatlantic sailing record\nAround the world sailing record\nPassage 7:\nAround the World in 80 Days (2009 TV series)\nAround the World in 80 Days is a British travel documentary series made to support the annual BBC Children in Need charity appeal in 2009. It sees twelve celebrities attempt to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days without using air transport, recreating the journey of Phileas Fogg and Michael Palin. Like Fogg and Palin, the journey begins and ends at the Reform Club in London. It was first shown on BBC One and BBC HD in October and November 2009.\n\nProduction\nThe challenge for the celebrities was to travel around the globe in eighty days, starting and ending at the Reform Club in London, re-enacting the challenge made to Phileas Fogg in the 1873 Jules Verne novel, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin. In each episode, a pair of celebrities travels a single leg of the round-the-world journey, trying to meet the next pair at a handover point in sufficient time, in relay race fashion. The journey could be completed by any means except by flight. At the handover, they pass to the succeeding team a carpet bag containing, amongst other items, a journal and a phone. Each of the celebrity pairs contributed to the journal as their leg of the journey progressed, and ahead of the trip Palin wrote an entry containing advice for the travellers.Throughout the journey, the celebrities collected various items on their leg of the journey. These were then auctioned to raise money for Children in Need, as was the journal completed by the travellers at the end of the trip.\n\nEpisodes\nAuction items\nUK to Turkey\n\nUkulele played by Frank Skinner\nPudsey bear signed by Frank Skinner\nPudsey bear signed by Lee MackTurkey to Kazakhstan\n\nPudsey bear signed by Nick Hewer\nPudsey bear signed by Saira KhanKazakhstan to Mongolia\n\nPudsey bear signed by Julia Bradbury\nPudsey bear signed by Matt BakerMongolia to USA\n\nSelection of paintings by Louise Minchin\nPudsey bear signed by Bill Turnbull\nPudsey bear signed by Louise MinchinUSA (California) to USA (Memphis)\n\nPink tutu\nPair of Around the World in 80 Days Boots\nPudsey bear signed by John Barrowman\nPudsey bear signed by Myleene KlassUSA to UK\n\nShane Ritchie's Outfit from 'Cargo'\nJosie Lawrence's Outfit from 'Cargo'\nPudsey bear signed by Shane Ritchie\nPudsey bear signed by Josie Lawrence\nSilver HarmonicaOther\n\nAround the World in 80 Days Journal\nAround the World in 80 Days Carpet Bag\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJohn Macklin\nJohn Farrell \"Big John\" Macklin (October 17, 1883 – October 10, 1949) was an American football player, coach of football, basketball, baseball and track and field, and a college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Michigan Agricultural College, now Michigan State University from 1911 to 1915. With a five-year record of 29–5, he has the highest winning percentage of any football coach in Michigan State history. Macklin coached the Michigan State Spartans football team to its first ever victories over Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Penn State. He was also the athletic director at Michigan Agricultural and coached the school's basketball, baseball, and track and field teams. Macklin tallied marks of 48–38 as head basketball coach (1910–1916) and 52–27 as head baseball coach (1911–1915).\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMacklin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts and attended Worcester High School. He played high school football for four years and was also the captain of Worcester's crew. After graduating from Worcester High School, Macklin attended Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire and then St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, playing football at each school.\n\nPenn\nAfter completing his preparatory education, Macklin enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Macklin grew to be a giant of a man for his time. He was 6 feet, 7 inches tall and weighed 275 pounds. When Macklin arrived at Penn, one account indicates there were no uniforms large enough to fit him: \"When the big husky appeared on the gridiron the first thing the coaches did was to send for the athletic outfitter, for there was not a suit on the campus that would encompass his frame.\" Macklin played two years at the tackle position for Penn's football team. The Chicago Daily Tribune later wrote: \"For a big man he was remarkably agile and his tackling on the wings and his quickness in getting through to break up plays was the delight of the coaches.\"\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1910, Macklin coached football at a boys' school at Pawling, New York. Macklin's success at Pawling brought him to the attention of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), which was in need of a new athletic director and coach. He was hired in January 1911 upon the recommendation of the renowned Penn athletic trainer Mike Murphy. Macklin was the head coach at Michigan State 1911 to 1915 and compiled a record of 29–5. His winning percentage of .853 is the highest in the history of the Michigan State Spartans football program. Macklin's 1913 Michigan State team finished with an undefeated, untied record of 7–0 and outscored opponents by a combined score of 180 to 28. Macklin was the first Michigan State coach to lead the Spartans to football victories over Ohio State (35–20 in 1912), Michigan (12–7 in 1913), Wisconsin (12–7 in 1913), and Penn State (6–3 in 1914). Macklin's 1913 team was also the first racially integrated team in the school's history, as Gideon Smith became the first African-American player for the Spartans.Macklin was also the athletic director and coach of the baseball, men's basketball, and track and field teams. He coached the basketball team from 1910 to 1916 and compiled a 48–38 (.558) record, including a 12–3 record for 1911–12 season. He coached the baseball team from 1911 to 1915, compiling a record of 52–27 (.658).Macklin retired from coaching in March 1916 to enter the coal mining business in Pennsylvania.\n\nLater years and honors\nThe Associated Press in 1949 called Macklin \"the founding father of the big time at Michigan State College.\" When he was hired in 1911, the school was putting on games for $200. When he left, the school received guarantees of $10,000 for games. As athletic director, he also led the effort to build new athletic buildings and a modern gymnasium. In 1935, Michigan State renamed its football stadium Macklin Field in his honor. At the time, Macklin was a coal mine operator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name was changed to Macklin Stadium in 1948, and in 1957, Macklin's name was dropped and replaced by the current name, Spartan Stadium.Macklin died at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia at age 65.\n\nHead coaching record\nFootball\nPassage 2:\nDon Coleman (offensive tackle)\nDon Edwin Coleman (May 4, 1928 – January 30, 2017) was an American football player.  Coleman played high school football at Flint Central High School and college football at Michigan State University.  He was a unanimous All-American in 1951, the first African-American All-American football player at Michigan State.  He was also the first Michigan State player to have his jersey number retired by the school.  In 1968, he also became the first African-American to serve on the coaching staff at Michigan State.  Coleman was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nEarly years\nColeman was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma in 1928 and moved with his family to Flint, Michigan before his freshman year in high school.  His father shined shoes at Flint's Durant Hotel, worked as a hotel porter, and worked in the automobile factories.Coleman did not play football until his senior year  at Flint Central High School.  Two of Coleman's older brothers had died in their youth, one from drowning and the other from pneumonia.  Coleman's mother did not want her youngest son to be injured playing football.  Accordingly, Coleman played No.1 trumpet in the high school band and competed in swimming for three years.  When Flint Central had a swim meet with Royal Oak High School, the Royal Oak coach \"made it known Coleman would not be allowed to swim because a black swimmer had never been in their pool.\"  Flint Central swim coach, Bob Richardson, stood behind Coleman and told the Royal Oak coach that, \"if Don Coleman couldn't swim, then the rest of the Flint Central team would not swim.\"   Coleman became the first black swimmer to enter Royal Oak's pool.As a senior in 1947, Coleman's mother finally agreed to allow her son to play football.  In his first year of football, he was selected as an all-state guard and led Flint Central to the state championship.\n\nMichigan State football player\nAfter graduating from Flint Central, Coleman enrolled at Michigan State University, then known as Michigan State College.  He played principally at thes second interception on consecutive plays from scrimmage by Michigan State put Notre Dame in a position to take the lead, but Azzaro's 41-yard field goal attempt with 4:38 left on the clock missed by inches to the right.\nAfter a Michigan State punt Notre Dame had the ball on its own 30-yard line with 1:24 left. They needed about 40 yards for a game-winning field goal. But coach Ara Parseghian, not wanting to risk a turnover that could hand the game to the Spartans, chose to run the ball four times—including on fourth down, which Notre Dame converted from its own 39-yard line. Michigan State called three time outs in an unsuccessful attempt to perhaps get the ball back and start a potential game-winning drive of their own.\nAfter making a first down with ten seconds left, O'Brien dropped back to pass, but was sacked by Bubba Smith. On the last play of the game, O'Brien gained five yards on a quarterback sneak. The game ended in a 10–10 tie.\n\nNotre Dame play-calling controversy\nAra Parseghian's decision to run the ball on five of six plays in the last one-and-a-half minutes drew criticism from some fans and sportswriters, who argued he should have played more aggressively to either win the game or risk losing it, and left some fans feeling disappointed at the game not having a more definitive resolution. Echoing one of the great idioms of Notre Dame lore, college football expert Dan Jenkins led off his article on the game for Sports Illustrated by sarcastically saying that Parseghian chose to \"Tie one for the Gipper\". Jenkins concluded that Parseghian \"felt arrogantly sure that Notre Dame could win the polls with a tie, not just over Michigan State but also over an undefeated and untied Alabama\".Until his death in 2017, however, Parseghian defended his end-of-the-game strategy. According to the same article, Parseghian cited his team's field position and the dynamics of the game as reasons why he hadn't played more aggressively: \"We'd fought hard to come back and tie it up. After all that, I didn't want to risk giving it to them cheap. They get reckless and it could cost them the game. I wasn't going to do a jackass thing like that at this point. [...] My starting quarterback, starting center, starting left tackle and all my top guys were over on the bench with me. We hadn't completed a pass in the last seven or eight attempts.\"\n\nAftermath\nThe most famous president of each school, Notre Dame’s Father Theodore Hesburgh and MSU’s John Hannah, together went into each locker room to console and congratulate the players. The two visionary leaders served for several years on the Civil Rights Commission beginning in the late 1950s and sat together during the MSU-Notre Dame battles.The tie resulted in 9–0–1 seasons for both Michigan State and Notre Dame. The final AP and Coaches' polls put the Irish and Spartans at No. 1 and No. 2, ranking both teams above the undefeated, and two time defending national champion 11–0–0 Alabama. Both schools shared the MacArthur Bowl.\nNotre Dame beat USC 51–0 the next week, completing an undefeated (but tied) regular season and solidifying its No. 1 claim. The Irish did not accept bowl bids between 1926 and 1969 (see below), and Michigan State was the victim of two Big Ten rules that would be rescinded a few years later: The same school could not represent the league in the Rose Bowl in back-to-back seasons (rescinded in December 1971, effective for the 1972 season), and no Big Ten school could play in a bowl game other than the Rose Bowl (rescinded for the 1975 season). So despite being Big Ten Champions and undefeated in the regular season, the Spartans could not play in the Rose Bowl, or indeed any bowl game.\nPlayers for both schools earned tremendous accolades for the season including All American honors. In the 1967 NFL draft, Michigan State had four players drafted within the first eight picks of the first roundAfter (but not necessarily as a result of) Eddy's injury while debarking from the train in East Lansing, Notre Dame football never traveled to away games by train again. Both teams now make the 160-mile trip by bus.\n\nLegacy\n40th anniversary\nOn September 23, 2006, Michigan State and Notre Dame commemorated the 40th anniversary of the game. Michigan State wore \"throwback\" jerseys and helmets from the 1960s era. Notre Dame declined to wear throwback jerseys or helmets. 45 members from the original '66 squad returned. In addition, 1965 and 1966 All American Bubba Smith had his No. 95 jersey retired at halftime, becoming only the third person in Michigan State history with such an honor. Notre Dame won the game 40–37, after coming back from a 16-point deficit and scoring 19 straight points to win.\n\n50th anniversary\nOn September 16, 2016, Notre Dame commemorated the 50th anniversary of the game. Members of the 1966 Notre Dame team appeared on the field prior to the game.\nPassage 10:\nDavid Hollister\nDavid Hollister (born April 3, 1942) served as the mayor of Lansing, Michigan from 1993 to 2003, until he resigned to be the director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth under Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm's administration.\n\nMayor\nDuring his tenure as mayor, he was instrumental in convincing General Motors Corporation to build the Grand River Assembly Plant downtown, and to build a new plant in the region to replace the Lansing Car Assembly Plant which dated back to 1903. Also under his tenure came the completion of Cooley Law School Stadium, the stadium for the Lansing Lugnuts, a Class A minor league baseball team. Hollister made central city (including downtown and Old Town) revitalization a top priority of his administration.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nHollister was born in Kalamazoo and raised in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he graduated from Battle Creek Central High School. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Michigan State University.\n\nCareer\nFrom 1967 to 1970 he was a social studies teacher at Lansing Eastern High School. Prior to becoming mayor, he served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1973-1993 representing the City of Lansing. In 2005 he was recruited to run Prima Civitas, an economic development organization funded by Michigan State University and the city governments of Lansing and East Lansing, Michigan.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Bennett\nGary L. Bennett (born January 17, 1940) is an American scientist and engineer, specializing in aerospace and energy.  He has worked for NASA and the US Department of Energy (DOE) on advanced space power systems and advanced space propulsion systems.  His professional career has included work on the Voyager, Galileo, and Ulysses space missions, and is currently working as a consultant in aerospace power and propulsion systems. He is also a science fiction author (The Star Sailors).\n\nBiography\nBennett was born in Twin Falls, Idaho. He joined the NASA headquarters in June 1988 as the Manager of Advanced Space Power Systems in the transportation division of the Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology. There, he managed a number of transportation technology programs including hybrid propulsion, electric propulsion, low-thrust chemical propulsion, and other advanced propulsion concepts (e.g., fusion, antimatter). He was also the first program manager of the advanced technology insertion program for the Pluto Fast Flyby (now New Horizons) mission and the TIMED space physics mission.\nPrior to coming to NASA, Bennett held key positions in DoE's space radioisotope power program, including serving as Director of Safety and Nuclear Operations for the radioisotope power sources that were used on the Galileo mission to Jupiter and that are being used on the Ulysses mission to explore the polar regions of the Sun.  This same radioisotope power source design was then flown on the Cassini mission to Saturn and on the New Horizons mission to Jupiter.\nPrevious positions included Chief of the Research Support Branch in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) where Bennett was instrumental in creating and managing NRC's reactor operational safety research program.\nBennett was the flight safety manager for the radioisotope power sources currently in use on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft (which went to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and beyond) and on Lincoln Laboratory's LES 8 and LES 9 communications satellites.\nBennett also worked as a physicist in the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications) program at what was then NASA's Lewis Research Center (now the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Cleveland, Ohio.  He did fundamental reactor safety research at what is now the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory (INL).\nFrom 1980 to 1988, he was a member of or adviser to US delegations to the two subcommittees of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and he prepared the official US position papers on the use of nuclear power sources in outer space.\nFrom 1988 to 1990, Bennett chaired the Steering Group of the Interagency Advanced Power Group (IAPG), the national coordinating group for federally sponsored space and terrestrial power research.  During his tenure and under his initiative the IAPG saw its greatest increase in membership.\nBennett received his PhD in physics from Washington State University in 1970; a Master of Nuclear Science degree in 1966, and a BSc degree in physics from the University of Idaho in 1962; and an Associate of Arts degree from Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) in 1960.\nSince 1995, he has been active in promoting the teaching of science (specifically evolution) and received the Friend of Darwin Award. Bennett has also been a champion of the First Amendment and was elected to the National Advisory Council of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nSelected works\nBennett has authored or coauthored over 160 technical papers, reports and articles on power, propulsion, and space missions.\nScience fiction\n\nG.L.

Planetary protection reflects both the unknown nature of the space environment and the desire of the scientific community to preserve the pristine nature of celestial bodies until they can be studied in detail.There are two types of interplanetary contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another celestial body.  Back contamination is the transfer of extraterrestrial organisms, if they exist, back to the Earth's biosphere.\n\nHistory\nThe potential problem of lunar and planetary contamination was first raised at the International Astronautical Federation VIIth Congress in Rome in 1956.In 1958 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) passed a resolution stating, “The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America urges that scientists plan lunar and planetary studies with great care and deep concern so that initial operations do not compromise and make impossible forever after critical scientific experiments.” This led to creation of the ad hoc Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX), which met for a year and recommended that interplanetary spacecraft be sterilized, and stated, “The need for sterilization is only temporary. Mars and possibly Venus need to remain uncontaminated only until study by manned ships becomes possible”.In 1959, planetary protection was transferred to the newly formed Committee on Space Research6, the spacecraft unexpectedly crossed the ion tail of Comet Hyakutake (C/1996 B2), revealing the tail to be at least 3.8 AU in length.\n\nComet C/1999 T1 (McNaught–Hartley)\nAn encounter with a comet tail happened again in 2004  when Ulysses flew through the ion tailings of C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley). A coronal mass ejection carried the cometary material to Ulysses.\n\nSecond Jupiter encounter\nUlysses approached aphelion in 2003/2004 and made further distant observations of Jupiter.\n\nComet C/2006 P1 (McNaught)\nIn 2007, Ulysses passed through the tail of comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught). The results were surprisingly different from its pass through Hyakutake's tail, with the measured solar wind velocity dropping from approximately 700 kilometers per second (1,566,000 mph) to less than 400 kilometers per second (895,000 mph).\n\nExtended mission\nESA's Science Program Committee approved the fourth extension of the Ulysses mission to March 2004  thereby allowing it to operate over the Sun's poles for the third time in 2007 and 2008. After it became clear that the power output from the spacecraft's RTG would be insufficient to operate science instruments and keep the attitude control fuel, hydrazine, from freezing, instrument power sharing was initiated. Up until then, the most important instruments had been kept online constantly, whilst others were deactivated. When the probe neared the Sun, its power-hungry heaters were turned off and all instruments were turned on.On 22 February 2008, 17 years and 4 months after the launch of the spacecraft, ESA and NASA announced that the mission operations for Ulysses would likely cease within a few months. On 12 April 2008, NASA announced that the end date will be 1 July 2008.The spacecraft operated successfully for over four times its design life. A component within the last remaining working chain of X-band downlink subsystem failed on 15 January 2008. The other chain in the X-band subsystem had previously failed in 2003.Downlink to Earth resumed on S-band, but the beamwidth of the high gain antenna in the S-band was not as narrow as in the X–band, so that the received downlink signal was much weaker, hence reducing the achievable data rate. As the spacecraft traveled on its outbound trajectory to the orbit of Jupiter, the downlink signal would have eventually fallen below the receiving capability of even the largest antennas (70 meters - 229.7 feet - in diameter) of the Deep Space Network.\nEven before the downlink signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control fuel on board the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft would no longer be able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band traveling-wave tube amplifiers, because they generated enough heat during operation to keep the propellant plumbing warm.\nThe previously announced mission end date of 1 July 2008, came and went but mission operations continued albeit in a reduced capacity. The availability of science data gathering was limited to only when Ulysses was in contact with a ground station due to the deteriorating S-band downlink margin no longer being able to support simultaneous real-time data and tape recorder playback. When the spacecraft was out of contact with a ground station, the S-band transmitter was switched off and the power was diverted to the internal heaters to add to the warming of the hydrazine. On 30 June 2009, ground controllers sent commands to switch to the low gain antennas. This stopped communications with the spacecraft, in combination with previous commands to shut down its transmitter entirely.\n\nResults\nDuring cruise phases, Ulysses provided unique data. As the only spacecraft out of the ecliptic with a gamma-ray instrument, Ulysses was an important part of the InterPlanetary Network (IPN). The IPN detects gamma ray bursts (GRBs); since gamma rays cannot be focused with mirrors, it was very difficult to locate GRBs with enough accuracy to study them further. Instead, several spacecraft can locate the burst through multilateration. Each spacecraft has a gamma-ray detector, with readouts noted in tiny fractions of a second. By comparing the arrival times of gamma showers with the separations of the spacecraft, a location can be determined, for follow-up with other telescopes. Because gamma rays travel at the speed of light, wide separations are needed. Typically, a determination came from comparing: one of several spacecraft orbiting the Earth, an inner-Solar-system probe (to Mars, Venus, or an asteroid), and Ulysses. When Ulysses crossed the ecliptic twice per orbit, many GRB determinations lost accuracy.\nAdditional discoveries:\nData provided by Ulysses led to the discovery that the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the Solar System in a more complex fashion than previously assumed.\nData provided by Ulysses led to the discovery that dust coming into the Solar System from deep space was 30 times more abundant than previously expected.\nIn 2007–2008 data provided by Ulysses led to the determination that the magnetic field emanating from the Sun's poles is much weaker than previously observed.\nThat the solar wind has \"grown progressively weaker during the mission and is currently at its weakest since the start of the Space Age\".\n\nFate\nUlysses will most likely continue in heliocentric orbit around the Sun indefinitely. However, there is a chance that in one of its re-encounters with Jupiter a close fly-by with one of the Jovian moons would be enough to alter its course and so the probe would enter a hyperbolic trajectory around the Sun and leave the Solar System.\n\nSee also\nAdvanced Composition Explorer – NASA satellite of the Explorer program\nList of heliophysics missions\nList of missions to the outer planets\nParker Solar Probe – NASA robotic space probe of the outer corona of the Sun\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory – European space observatory\nSTEREO – Solar observation mission (2006–present)\nTRACE – NASA satellite of the Explorer program\nWIND – NASA probe to study solar wind, at L1 since 1995\nSolar Orbiter – European space-based solar observatory\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Dunning launched Cinépix with partner André Link in Montreal in the early 1960s. Their biggest commercial success—and the first Canadian box office hit—came with Reitman's Meatballs (1979).\n\nEarly life\nDunning was born in the Greater Montreal district of Verdun, Quebec—and into the film business. Dunning's father Mickey toured Quebec screening newsreel footage and later owned several cinemas. By the age of 13, John was working the candy counter at his family's Century Theatre in adjacent Ville-Émard. Upon his father's death several years later, Dunning managed the cinema, beginning a lifelong career in film.\n\nCareer\nDunning launched Cinépix with partner André Link in Montreal in the early 1960s. Initially a distribution company, Cinépix's first production was the 1969 erotic drama Valérie, which earned $1 million at the box office. Cinépix produced early work by David Cronenberg (Shivers) and Ivan Reitman (Meatballs). The company also distributed art-house films including the grunge rock documentary Hype, Vincent Gallo's Buffalo '66, and SICK: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist.From 1989 to 1994, Cinépix was partners with Famous Players in C/FP Distribution, which was renamed Cinépix Film Properties (C/FP). In 1994, Cinépix bought Famous Players' stake in the organization.By 1997, Cinépix had a New York-based U.S. distribution arm and owned 56 percent of Ciné-Groupe, an animated film production company.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation (LGEC) was formed in 1997 by Frank Giustra, a banker. LGEC purchased Cinépix and kept its leadership; Dunning, in turn, left the company.

His maternal grandfather Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister at the time of his birth. His maternal grandmother, Lady Dorothy Cavendish, was descended from three Prime Ministers, the 4th Duke of Devonshire (1756–1757), the 2nd Earl of Shelburne (1782–1783) and the 3rd Duke of Portland (1783 and 1807–1809).

Of these, Brandreth is the only person to have made appearances on episodes presented by both hosts.\n\nEpisodes\nWilliam G. Stewart era\nThe first episode was broadcast on 27 December 1990. The format is largely the same as that of Fifteen to One, though with the Barry Cryer rule: Those who get both questions wrong may still play round 2 with one life remaining, with Cryer being the only one to miss both questions. Cryer was also the first contestant to be eliminated.  The programme is extended to 45 minutes from 30, with an extra advert added between the first and second rounds.\nA second celebrity special aired on 30 December 1992. In his book \"A Matter of Facts: An Insider's Guide To Quizzing\", contestant Marcus Berkmann, who had previously appeared on a civilian episode of the show two years prior, explained that he was asked to appear on the programme after Vincent Hanna pulled out and noted that \"clearly some barrels had been scraped for this, and [he] was at the bottom of the very last barrel\". The winner, Patrick Stoddart, won by taking a step back from the rest of the semi-circle, resulting in no one nominating him in round 2. This would be the last Celebrity Fifteen to One for over twenty years.\n\nAdam Hills era\nThe show was revived on 20 September 2013 as part of a 1980s night. This version was hosted by Adam Hills and was 1 hour long rather than 45 minutes and did not reprise what UKGameshows.com termed as the Barry Cryer rule; \"just one life away for each incorrect answer in round one\". It did, however, slash the number of questions in round three down to 25, and eliminated the need for three correct answers to start question or nominate. Money was awarded for getting to the final: £1,000 for getting there; £5,000 for coming second; £10,000 for coming first + £1,000 for however many lives they have left + £1,000 for getting any of the questions right after both the other finalists have been eliminated + £100 for every life they entered the round with. Jo Brand won this episode, winning £21,100 for her charity.\nAfter the first show aired, it was announced by Channel 4 that the show would be revived for four more celebrity specials featuring Hills and for twenty daytime episodes featuring Sandi Toksvig. Changes were made; money was not awarded for lives left at the end of the round two, and for the last celebrity standing, the last five questions are worth £2,000 each. The winners of these programmes were Josie Long, who raised £25,000, Stephen Mangan and Dave Gorman, who both raised £23,000, and Sian Williams, who raised £22,000. These episodes were transmitted on 6, 13, 20 and 27 June 2015 respectively.\nA Christmas special was broadcast on 23 December 2014. Rufus Hound raised £11,000 after a particularly tight final round in which all three contestants were standing at the end of 25 questions, and Hound opted to take two questions from 71–82 down with only one life left.\nFour more episodes of Celebrity Fifteen to One were broadcast on 7, 14, 21 and 28 August 2015. Winners of these episodes were Alex James, who raised £11,000, Kate Humble, who raised £26,000, Gary Delaney, who raised £11,000 and Tanni Grey-Thompson, who raised £13,000.\nWilliam G.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMasilamaniswara Temple, Thiruvaduthurai\nMasilamaniswara Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Hindu god Shiva, located in the village of Thiruvaduthurai, located 22 km from the South Indian town, Kumbakonam and 14 km from Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. The temple is referred to in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century Tamil Saiva canon by Tirugnana Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar. The temple is associated with the legend of Saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE).\nThe temple is believed to have been built by Cholas during 9th century A.D and with significant additions from later Chola kings and by the subsequent ruling empires. It houses five-tiered gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Masilamaniswarar and Oppilamulai Nayagi Amman being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, whose headquarters is located inside the temple.\n\nLegend\nLegend associates the temple with the saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE). Tirumular saw a herd of cows lamenting the death of their herdsmen named Moolan. Being a siddha, he entered into the body of Moolan, came back alive to serve as the herdsman. It is believed that he was coming from North to South India to meet sage Agastya. When he went back to the place where he left his original body, he did not find it. Considering it as a divine play, he continued to remain in the body of Moolan for the rest of his life.As per another legend, Parvathi was cursed to become a cow and she worshipped Shiva to attain her original form. The legend is closely associated with this temple, but is also associated with other temples like Thenupuriswarar Temple at Patteswaram, Aavoor Pasupatheeswaram and Tirukogarnam near Pudukkottai.\n\nHistory\nThe temple is counted as one of the earliest temples built during the regime of Parantaka I. An inscription in the temple indicates record of grants to pipers, land endowments, flower gardens, carriers of sacred water during his third regnal year. Another inscription from his 38th regnal year recorded as 143 of 1925 indicates  gift of 500 kalanjus of gold for the construction of the kudapadai upwards. Historians believe that the temple was built by Tirukaralippichan and was completed during the regime of Parantaka. There are other inscriptions that indicate donation of gold and silver vessels to the temple. The inscriptions from Rajaraja I recorded as 104 and 107 of 1925 indicate similar gift of metal images to the temple. This is counted as the first mention of portrait installation indicated in an inscription, with the other ones being in Konerirajapuram and Thiruvisanallur temples. The temple has been maintained and administered by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, whose headquarters is located inside the temple.\n\nArchitecture\nThe temple is located 12 km away from Mayiladuthurai and 24 km away from Kumbakonam. The temple has a five tiered Rajagopuram with elevated stone walls separating the second, third and fourth precinct. The images of the presiding deity, Masilamaniswarar, in the form of Shiva lingam occupies the main sanctum facing east. The shrine of the consort of Masilamaniswarar, Oppilamulaiyar faces west. The third prakaram has a separate shrine for the saivite saint Tirumular. The temple has three water bodies located at various places inside the temple. The Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam is located in the premises outside the fourth precinct.\n\nReligious significance\nThe temple is revered in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century Saivite canonical work by the three saint poets, namely, Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar.  The temple is reverred by Sambandar in the third Tirumurai in one verse, Appar in five and Sundarar in two verses.\n\"இடரினும் தளரினும் எனதுறுநோய்\nதொடரினும் உனகழல் தொழுதெழுவேன்\nகடல்தனில் அமுதொடு கலந்தநஞ்சை\nமிடறினில் அடக்கிய வேதியனேஇதுவோஎமை ஆளுமா றீவதொன்றெமக் கில்லையேல்\nஅதுவோவுன தின்னருள் ஆவடுதுறை அரனே.\"\ntranslating to\n\n\"when I am undergoing sufferings.\nwhen I am depressed in spirits.\nwhen my big karmams follow me I shall wake up from sleep worshipping your feet.\nCivaṉ who gave out the Vētams and who controlled the poison which was mixed with the nectar in the ocean of milk and made it stay in the neck!\nCivaṉ in Āvaṭutuṟai!\nif there is nothing to give to us.\nis this way you admit us as your protege?\nis your sweet grace like that?\".Sambandar is believed to obtained gold coins from the presiding deity for performing Yagna by his father. Sundarar was relieved off his curse after praying the presiding deity. Thirumoolar, a Sidhha saint, is believed to have sung 3,000 in praise of the presiding deity in the temple. Thirumaligai Devar, another Siddha, is believed to have performed many wonders in the temple. The Samathi of both the Siddhas are in the precinct of the temple.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPueraria\nPueraria is a genus of 15–20 species of legumes native to Asia. The best known member is kudzu, also called Japanese arrowroot. The genus is named after 19th century Swiss botanist Marc Nicolas Puerari.\nThe genus, as traditionally circumscribed, is polyphyletic, with different species being more related to other species in the tribe Phaseoleae. Current research, reproduced below, splits the genus into five clades, one of which defines the current monophyletic genus.\n\nSpecies\nThe genus Pueraria is highly polyphyletic; the below list is divided by clade following the result of A.N.Egan & B.Pan (2016). In 2015, the authors validly published their proposal in Phytotaxa. As of February 2022, Kew Plants of the World Online database accepts these names.\n\nPueraria sensu stricto\nPueraria sensu stricto includes the vast majority of species in the genus.

It grows in semi-arid areas with rainfall of between 150mm and 300mm, in the Karoo of South Africa.\n\nEtymology\nThe species epithet nelii honours the South African botanist Gert Cornelius Nel. The common name \"split rock\" refers to the appearance of the plant's leaves.\n\nDescription\nPleiospilos nelii is a succulent perennial which can reach a height of 5–8 cm (2–3 in) and a diameter of about 10 cm (4 in). This very short-stemmed, nearly stemless plant has one or more pairs of opposite, almost hemispherical, grey-green or brownish leaves. The surface of the leaves has many small dark spots. A new pair of leaves is produced each year, replacing an older pair. This plant closely resembles a small cracked rock (hence the common name), an appearance which may have evolved as a defence against herbivory. The superficially daisy-like flowers are yellow-orange, 6–7.5 cm (2–3 in) across, and emerge from the plant's apical bud. The flowers are large in relation to the size of the plant. Each flower opens in the afternoon and closes at sunset, over a bloom period of several days.\n\nCultivation\nP. nelii is one of several plants cultivated for their rocklike appearance. They are sometimes collectively called mesembs. In temperate regions it is grown under glass for protection from excessive rain and hard freezes. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nPleiospilos simulans\nPleiospilos simulans (liver plant, split rock plant) is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae, once endemic to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Known populations of the plant in the wild are now extinct due its collection as an ornamental plant for succulent collectors. It is a small, low-growing, perennial with succulent leaves and orange or yellow many-petaled flowers.\nPassage 4:\nPleiospilos\nPleiospilos is a genus of succulent flowering plants of the family Aizoaceae, native to South Africa. The name is derived from the Greek pleios \"many\" and spìlos \"spot\". The plants are also known as kwaggavy (\"Quagga mesemb\"), lewerplant (\"liver plant\"), lewervygie (\"liver mesemb\"), klipplant (\"stone plant\"), split rock or mimicry plant.\nPleiospilos species have two or four opposite, very fleshy, grey-green leaves growing from a short stem that may be underground. The leaves, with their hemispherical shape and pitted texture, often strongly resemble a pile of split pebbles to deter predators. Flowers emerge from the center of the leaves, and may be very big in relation to the overall size of the plant.They reproduce both sexually and asexually. Vegetative offshoots emerge from the root system. Seed set occurs in early spring around March.The species P. bolusii and  P. nelii are cultivated as ornamentals.\n\nSpecies\nPleiospilos bolusii\nPleiospilos compactus\nP. compactus subsp. compactus\nP. compactus subsp. canus\nP. compactus subsp. minor\nP. compactus subsp. fergusoniae\nP. compactus subsp. sororius\nPleiospilos nelii\nPleiospilos simulans\nPassage 5:\nPleiospilos bolusii\nPleiospilos bolusii, the mimicry plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae, native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where it grows at an altitude of 750–1,100 m (2,461–3,609 ft). The species epithet bolusii honours Harry Bolus, a 19th-century South African botanist.\nIt is a small, stemless succulent perennial growing to 8 cm (3 in) tall by 15 cm (6 in) wide, with two or four opposite grey-green leaves, quite thick, fused at the base, almost triangular, with entire margins. The leaves are longer and more angular than those of the closely related P. nelii, but in both cases the shape and texture of the leaves resemble a pile of split pebbles, possibly to deter predators. The yellow, many-petaled, daisy-like flowers emerge from the center of the leaves, and are 6–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter - large in relation to the overall size of the plant. The flowers are often coconut-scented. The flowering period extends from August to September.\nThe plant is one of several species cultivated for their rocklike appearance, which are sometimes collectively called mesembs. With a minimum temperature of 7 °C (45 °F), in temperate regions it is grown under glass. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJerry A. Johnson\nJerry A. Johnson is the former President of the National Religious Broadcasters. He became president of NRB on November 1, 2013, succeeding Frank Wright. Before accepting that post, he was President of Criswell College, and former dean of academics at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.  He also held several positions during 14 years at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. From 2013 to 2014 he served as Chairman of the Nominating Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.\nPassage 2:\nMidwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\nMidwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (MBTS) is a Private Baptist seminary in Kansas City, Missouri. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary also houses an undergraduate college, Spurgeon College (formerly known as Midwestern College).\n\nHistory\nMidwestern Seminary was officially founded on May 29, 1957, when the Southern Baptist Convention voted to establish the institution and elected a board of trustees. Since that time, the trustees have been regularly and exclusively elected by the Southern Baptist Convention. Under the leadership of the original board of trustees, the seminary was established in 1958 in northern Kansas City, Missouri, with six faculty members and 136 students. Most of the property on which the seminary is housed was donated by the Vivion family; the Vivion farmhouse has been restored and is now the official residence of the seminary's presidential family.Doctrinally, MBTS is guided by the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. Every member of the faculty and administration is required to sign a statement agreeing to the precepts of this document. While students are required to be Christians, they are not required to affirm the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. The purpose statement of Midwestern Seminary was revised in 2008 to read, \"Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary serves the church by biblically educating God-called men and women to be and to make disciples of Jesus Christ.\"\nJason K. Allen was installed as president in 2012 and began revitalization. The seminary almost tripled in size in the next five years, becoming one of the fastest-growing seminaries in North America and one of the largest in the world. Enrollment has nearly tripled in five years, from 1,107 in the 2010–2011 academic year to surpassing 3,000 students in 2017–2018.The seminary was granted an exception to Title IX in 2016 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.\n\nCampus\nMidwestern Seminary is located in Kansas City, Missouri, at the intersection of Vivion Rd. and N. Oak Trafficway, a few minutes from downtown. A new 1,000 seat auditorium, The Daniel Lee Chapel, was dedicated in April 2014. Other recent improvements to the campus include the O.S. Hawkins Courtyard and the Charles Spurgeon Library.\nThe campus includes dormitory and apartment buildings for residential students, playground and picnic areas, a modest fishing pond, and over 220 acres of woods. The Sword & Trowel Bookstore is also located on campus.\nIn 2016, the seminary announced plans to build a new Student Center on the north slope of the campus, using a $7 million lead gift by the Mathena family of Oklahoma City. Construction on this project—which includes a gymnasium, fitness center, faculty offices, cafeteria, coffee shop, bookstore, and expanded study center, and which includes exterior plans for sports fields—concluded in 2018. The 40,000 square foot center opened for the Fall 2018 semester.\n\nThe Spurgeon Center and Library\nThe Spurgeon Library houses the remaining personal collection of Charles Spurgeon, which Midwestern Seminary acquired from William Jewell College in 2006. The dedication of the library took place in October 2015, and the Seminary is now working to digitize the collection and publish new volumes of previously undiscovered sermons. Geoff Chang serves as the curator of the collection, which also includes artifacts from Spurgeon's life and ministry, among them his personal writing desk, travel kit, and the metalwork from his study door. The library interior is appointed in academic \"Oxford style\" and includes portraits highlighting the life of Spurgeon commissioned by Christian T. George and Midwestern Seminary of the Romanian artist Petru Botezatu.\n\nFor The Church\nSince Allen's installation as president of Midwestern Seminary, the institution has emphasized \"For The Church\" as its vision statement for academic and institutional renewal, seeking to re-connect the purpose of theological education to the support and strengthening of local churches. This vision has been manifested in numerous events and resources, including Midwestern's website For The Church and the annual For The Church national conference held in Kansas City, which has featured internationally renowned speakers Matt Chandler, H.B. Charles Jr., Russell Moore, David Platt, and Ray Ortlund Jr.\n\nAcademics\nMBTS is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The seminary is accredited to offer several master's degrees that are generally classified as Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Master of Arts. Midwestern also offers an MTS (Master of Theological Studies) degree and a Graduate Certificate in Christian Foundations for Lay Ministers.\nAt the doctoral level, MBTS offers professional doctorates: Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), Doctor of Educational Ministry (D.Ed.Min.), and a research doctorate Doctor of Philosophy in Biblical Studies. The seminary also has a Korean language track for its Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Educational Ministry, Doctor of Education, and Doctor of Ministry degrees and a Spanish language track for its Doctor of Ministry degree.\nSpurgeon College offers a variety of undergraduate degrees in ministry, missions, and theology, as well as degrees in leadership, counseling psychology, and philosophy. Through the Accelerate program undergrads may earn both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Divinity degree simultaneously in a rigorous five-year course of study. Associate degrees are also available through the college. Undergrad students interested in pursuing a call to mission work may also participate in Midwestern's Fusion program, a training cohort partially funded by the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention which includes cultural studies, physical training, and stints overseas to better prepare future missionaries for the realities of their work.\nSince 2010, Midwestern Seminary offers both graduate and undergraduate degrees entirely online, through the Online You program. Available degrees include the standard M.Div., MTS, and BA, with select concentrations available as well.\nMost recently, Midwestern has provided incentives for residential education, including the Timothy Track, which partners M.Div students with local churches to serve in internship programs, and The Residency, a contextual component of the standard doctoral program that facilitates immediate, 2018, the BTSR Trustees announced that the school would close, effective June 30, 2019.  The trustees cited financial pressure as the reason for the closure, and said that the school would work with students to transfer their credits to other seminaries.\nPassage 10:\nLee Rutland Scarborough\nLee Rutland Scarborough (1870–1945) was an American Southern Baptist pastor, evangelist, denominational leader, and professor at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS). He spent the first 16 years of his life on a ranch and became an adept cowboy. He attended later Baylor University, Yale University and The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.  He accepted the invitation of B. H. Carroll in 1908 to occupy the world's first academic chair of evangelism, \"The Chair of Fire,\" at SWBTS, (also known as the L. R. Scarborough Chair of Evangelism) and chaired the seminary's department of evangelism. In February 1915, following the death of B. H. Carroll, he became president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He remained in both positions until 1942, during which time he also served a term as president of the Baptist General Convention of Texas (1929–32) and a term as president of the Southern Baptist Convention (1938–40).\n\nWorks\nScarborough, L.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFitz and The Tantrums\nFitz and the Tantrums are an American indie pop and neo soul band from Los Angeles, California, that formed in 2008. The band consists of Michael Fitzpatrick (lead vocals), Noelle Scaggs (co-lead vocals and percussion), James King (saxophone, flute, keyboard, percussion and guitar), Joseph Karnes (bass guitar), Jeremy Ruzumna (keyboards) and John Wicks (drums and percussion) who left the band in 2022 to teach at University of Montana. Their debut studio album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released in August 2010 on indie label Dangerbird Records and received critical acclaim. It reached no. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The band signed to their current label Elektra Records in early 2013 and went on to release their second LP, More Than Just a Dream, the same year. Their self-titled third album was released in 2016, which contains their most notable song, \"HandClap\". Their fourth studio album, All the Feels, was released in 2019.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nFitz and the Tantrums was founded by Michael Fitzpatrick in 2008. Having purchased an old Conn electronic organ, he was inspired to write the song \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\" that same night. He contacted his college friend, saxophonist James King, who recommended singer Noelle Scaggs and former drummer John Wicks who left the band in 2022. In turn, King brought in bassist Joseph Karnes and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna. According to Fitzpatrick, the band immediately clicked. He has said, \"It was literally like five phone calls, one rehearsal, and we could have played a show that night.\" The band performed their first show at Hotel Café in Hollywood, in December 2008, which Fitzpatrick booked one week after their first rehearsal. In interviews, he has stated the importance of booking a date before the band was ready, in order to bring out the best in all performers. During the first half of 2009, they performed at several clubs in Los Angeles, including The Viper Room and Spaceland. Before Joseph Karnes was brought into the band, the previous bassist, Ethan Phillips was with the band for the first EP, and a part of their first album, \"Pickin' Up The Pieces\".\n\nThe band recorded their debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, during the first half of 2009 at Fitzpatrick's home in Los Angeles. The EP was first released on August 11, 2009, through Canyon Productions. In September 2009 they toured with Hepcat and Flogging Molly. In November 2009 the band opened eight concerts on the Maroon 5's Back to School Tour. Their appearance was on short notice, after previously scheduled opener K'naan cancelled due to fatigue in late October. According to Fitzpatrick, \"Adam Levine from Maroon 5 was in New York to get a tattoo, and his favorite tattoo artist had downloaded the record after hearing us on the radio. He told Adam, 'you gotta hear this band.' A week and a half later, we're opening for Maroon 5 on their college tour.\" In December 2009 the band shot the official music video for their first single, \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\", which was directed by Joshua Leonard. It features Fitzpatrick and Scaggs in a moving and rotating bed.\n\nPickin' Up the Pieces\nIn March 2010 Fitz and the Tantrums played at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. On April 15, 2010, they opened for ska band The Specials on their North American reunion tour at Club Nokia in Los Angeles. On April 26, 2010, Dangerbird Records announced that they had signed Fitz and the Tantrums. Their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released on August 24, 2010. Producer Chris Seefried was also a co-writer on the album. In October 2010, Daryl Hall invited the band to perform on his web-series Live from Daryl's House. They played a seven-song set including four Fitz and the Tantrums songs, early Hall song \"Girl I Love You\", \"Perkiomen\" and finishing with \"Sara Smile\". \"I walked back into the kitchen of his big old house in upstate New York, and his mother was there,\" recalled Fitzpatrick. \"She said, 'Fitz, come over here. You sound just like my son!'\"\nThe band performed the songs \"MoneyGrabber\" and \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! in Los Angeles on January 12, 2011. On February 28 they performed \"MoneyGrabber\" on TBS' Conan, and on April 5 on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In 2011 the band announced a U.S. and international tour with April Smith and the Great Picture Show. In the fall of 2011, they made their first appearance at Austin City Limits Music Festival.

Scaggs toured with the band for ten years before taking two years off from music.\n\nFitz and the Tantrums\nIn December 2008 she joined the Los Angeles soul/pop band Fitz and the Tantrums for a rehearsal after being recommended to band leader Michael Fitzpatrick by saxophone player James King. According to Scaggs, \"When I first heard the project I was really attracted to the sound. It was something that wasn't really familiar in the spectrum of not being exactly Motown or something from the '80s.\"They performed for the first time a week later at Hollywood's Hotel Café, and she decided to remain with the band as a vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. They released their debut EP Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1 in August 2009, and the tracks soon received airplay on public radio station KCRW in Los Angeles.\nSix months after their first performance they had slots at Lollapalooza and Telluride Blues & Brews.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLike a Virgin (album)\nLike a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label was not ready to give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time.\nThe album's photographs were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make a provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. While not a substantial musical departure from Madonna's first album, she felt that the material from Like a Virgin was stronger. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from music critics; however, retrospective reviews of the album have been much more positive. Like a Virgin was a commercial success and became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200 and set the record as the first female album in history  to sell over five million copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) later certified it diamond for shipment of ten million units. It also reached number one in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, and remains one of the best-selling albums of all time with sales of over 21 million copies worldwide.Five singles were released from the album, including Madonna's first US number-one \"Like a Virgin\" and her first UK number-one \"Into the Groove\", the latter of which was introduced on the 1985 international reissue of the album. To promote the album, she embarked on The Virgin Tour, touring North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 1980s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially \"Material Girl\" and \"Like a Virgin\". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment.\" In 2023, the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry for preservation in the United States, for being a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" recording.\n\nBackground\nA former dancer and fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Ciccone became known to the world simply as Madonna, with the release of her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like \"Holiday\", \"Borderline\" and \"Lucky Star\", the album was one of the best selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most exciting new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her \"street-smart dance queen\" persona, and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, \"My work, my dedication—the stubbornness for getting Madonna released—had paid off. Now it was time to solidify my future.\"For Like a Virgin, Madonna attempted to become one of the primary record producers, feeling the need to control the various aspects of her music. She believed that depending on a particular producer for her album was not something that suited her. Madonna said \"I learnt my lesson while creating my debut album, and the way [Reggie, the producer of her debut project] Lucas left me in the water with the project, you can't trust men\"—referring to the incident, when due to a certain difference of opinion between producer Reggie Lucas and Madonna, Lucas had left the project half-way. However, Warner Bros. Records was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography of Madonna, she commented,\n\nWarner Bros. Records is a hierarchy of old men and it's a chauvinist environment to be working in because I'm treated like this sexy little girl. I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight.\nUltimately, Nile Rodgers was chosen by Madonna as the producer of the album, with the approval of the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work as a member of the 1970s band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, \"When I was making the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money so that I could work with him.\"For his part, Rodgers recalled that he had first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: \"I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always wanted to work with her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity.\"\n\nRecording\nThe album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to \"go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning.\" Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: \"I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement when it comes to making pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate,5. In 2016, she collaborated on the song \"Seven Day Love\" included in the album \"Inzombia\" by Canadian singer Belly. She has also worked with numerous artists, including Sia, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Queen Latifah, Usher and Kelly Clarkson to interpret the songs of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" for the compilation \"The Hamilton Mixtape\".In 2017, Ashanti announced her seventh studio album, revealing it would be released in 2018. She denied this in June 2018, confirming the future release of an album in collaboration with rapper Ja Rule. Between 2017 and 2018 she returned to the music scene with several collaborations including the single \"Say Less\" with Ty Dolla Sign, the track \"The Road\" by Machel Montano, and the song \"Start This Shit Off Right\" with Mack Maine, from the album \"Tha Carter V\" by Lil Wayne.Ashanti released the collaboration \"Pretty Little Thing\" with Afro B in August 2019. She also featured on the soundtrack of the film Stuck, which she produced. In November, Ashanti guest-starred as herself in two episodes of the third season of The CW's Dynasty reboot: \"Mother, I'm At La Mirage\" and \"Something Desperate\".In January 2021, Ashanti released her single \"2:35 (I Want You)\".On March 10, 2022, Ashanti's single \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" was heavily sampled for British rapper Aitch's single \"Baby\".In October 2022, Ashanti was featured on Diddy’s “Gotta Move On” remix which also features Bryson Tiller and Yung Miami.\n\nArtistry\nAshanti has a lyric soprano voice type. Critics have referred to her voice as \"pretty\" and her soprano as \"sultry\" and \"sweet but slight\". Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic noted her reputation for using her \"swooning voice\" in duets with Big Pun, Fat Joe, and Ja Rule. As a young girl, Ashanti was influenced by Ella Fitzgerald, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tupac Shakur, but she cites Mary J. Blige as the main reason she wanted to pursue a singing career. Further musical influences include Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, and Blue Magic.\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2003, Ashanti partnered with LidRock and the San Francisco-based Family Violence Prevention Fund (FVPF) to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence during National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and to distribute the \"Rain on Me\" mini-movie using LidRock's unique platform. Proceeds from the $5 mini-disc went towards helping to stop domestic violence. Ashanti also recorded a public service announcement that appeared in more than 4,000 film screens and reached millions of people. Ashanti also gives back by raising money for sickle cell research and she is active in helping the Make-A-Wish Foundation stating, \"I'll go and do just about anything for them.\" In 2005, Ashanti helped by recording public service announcement and raising money for the Southeast Asia tsunami disaster. Later that year, she helped raise money for the Hurricane Katrina victims and storm evacuees.In 2008, Ashanti, along with others celebrities, taped a PSA to help stop violence and discrimination towards the LGBT community in response to the death of Lawrence King, an eighth-grader at E.O. Green Junior High School, who was shot because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. That same year, she launched a special on-line campaign called \"I Declare Me...\" with Wal-Mart. The campaign's core is a very personal focus on the self-definition and empowerment of women across the United States, with its home base at Ashanti's official website. The campaign creates a safe and inclusive on-line space to for women to share testimonies on the site. Participants are able to openly declare their own breakthroughs, revelations, struggles and victories in every life area they choose: career, birth, death, relationships, and personal situations. \"I Declare Me...\" also invites women to a virtual discussion with Ashanti on such issues as voter registration, teen obesity, and other concerns facing women today.\nIn September 2009, Ashanti, along with other artists such as Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Fergie, Sheryl Crow, Miley Cyrus, Melissa Etheridge, Natasha Bedingfield, Keyshia Cole, Ciara, Leona Lewis, LeAnn Rimes and Carrie Underwood, teamed up for the song \"Just Stand Up!\". The charity tune for cancer was conceived by Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who produced it with longtime creative colleague Babyface. All 15 singers (along with Nicole Scherzinger) shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special, which aired simultaneously on ABC, NBC and CBS, and helped raise $100 million for cancer research. As a result of SU2C fund raising endeavors, the SU2C scientific advisory committee, overseen by the American Association for Cancer Research, was able to award 73.6 million dollars towards novel, groundbreaking cancer research in 2009.In November 2009, Ashanti joined the crew of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. In the episode, which aired on January 24, 2010, the singer assisted in the rebuilding of the Powell Family home in Buffalo, New York.  The efforts from the show expanded significantly to include not just the family home but the entire neighborhood surrounding it. In 2013, Ashanti featured on the 19-track compilation album Songs for a Healthier America, a collaborative project by the Partnership for a Healthier America, whose honorary chair is Michelle Obama, and Hip Hop Public Health. Her song \"Just Believe\" also featured Artie Green, Gerry Gunn, Robbie Nova and Chauncey Hawkins. Additionally, she is affiliated with the Jumpstart reading program, the Tupperware Brand and the Boys and Girls Club of America.\n\nPersonal life\nOn January 1, 2003, Ashanti met rapper Nelly at a press conference for the 2003 Grammy Awards, and the two later began dating. They ended their relationship after a decade together. In 2023, they reunited and got back together.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albumsAshanti (2002)\nChapter II (2003)\nAshanti's Christmas (2003)\nConcrete Rose (2004)\nThe Declaration (2008)\nBraveheart (2014)\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nTheater\nSee also\nList of awards and nominations received by Ashanti\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

While her casting was met withisons between the two. Eric Mink concluded that ER may rate more highly in the Nielsens but Chicago Hope told better stories, while Rich felt both shows were \"riveting, superior TV fare.\" The Daily Telegraph wrote in 1996: \"Not being able to follow what on earth is going on remains one of the peculiar charms of the breakneck American hospital drama, ER\".In 2002, TV Guide ranked ER No. 22 on their list of \"TV's Top 50 Shows\", making it the second highest ranked medical drama on the list (after St. Elsewhere at No. 20). Also, the season 1 episode \"Love's Labor Lost\" was ranked No. 6 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time list having earlier been ranked No. 3. The show placed No. 19 on Entertainment Weekly's \"New TV Classics\" list. British magazine Empire ranked it No. 29 in their list of the \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" and said the best episode was \"Hell And High Water\" (Season 2, Episode 7) where \"Doug Ross (George Clooney) saves a young boy from drowning during a flood.\" In 2012, ER was voted Best TV Drama on ABC's 20/20 special episode \"Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time\".

On September 12, 2016 the series was re-released in three box sets, Seasons 1–5, Seasons 6–10 and Seasons 11–15.\nThe DVD box sets of ER are unusual in the fact that they are all in anamorphic widescreen even though the first six seasons of the show were broadcast in a standard 4:3 format. ER was shot protecting for widescreen presentation, allowing the show to be presented in 16:9 open matte (leaving only the title sequence in the 4:3 format).

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRobert Aldrich\nRobert Burgess Aldrich (August 9, 1918 – December 5, 1983) was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. An iconoclastic and maverick auteur working in many genres during the Golden Age of Hollywood, he directed mainly films noir, war movies, westerns and dark melodramas with Gothic overtones. His most notable credits include Vera Cruz (1954), Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Big Knife (1955), Autumn Leaves (1956), Attack (1956), What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and The Longest Yard (1974).\nAldrich's directorial style combined \"macho mise-en-scene and resonant reworkings of classic action genres,\" and were known for pushing the boundaries of violence in mainstream cinema, and for their psychologically-complex interpretations of genre film tropes. The British Film Institute wrote that Aldrich's films \"subversive sensibility in thrall to the complexities of human behaviour.\" Several of his films later proved influential to members of the French New Wave.Aside from his directorial work, Aldrich was also noted for his advocacy as a member of the Directors Guild of America, serving as its President for two terms, and becoming the namesake for its Robert B. Aldrich Achievement Award.\n\nEarly life\nFamily\nRobert Burgess Aldrich was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, into a family of wealth and social prominence – \"The Aldriches of Rhode Island\". His father, Edward Burgess Aldrich (1871–1957) was the publisher of The Times of Pawtucket and an influential operative in state Republican politics. His mother, Lora Elsie (née Lawson) of New Hampshire (1874–1931), died when Aldrich was 13 and was remembered with fondness by her son. Ruth Aldrich Kaufinger (1912–1987) was his elder sister and only sibling.Among his notable ancestors were the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene and the theologian Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island Colony.His grandfather, Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich, was a self-made millionaire and art investor. A Republican member of the U.S. Senate for thirty years (1881–1911), he was dubbed \"General Manager of the Nation\" by the press for his dominant role in framing federal monetary policy.A number of Aldrich's paternal uncles had impressive careers, among them a successful investment banker, an architect and Harvard instructor, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank who also served as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain.  An aunt, Abigail Greene \"Abby\" Aldrich married John D. Rockefeller Jr., scion of the Standard Oil fortune, and was a leading figure in the establishment of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Nelson Rockefeller, a four-term governor of New York State and U.S. vice-president under Gerald Ford, and Rockefeller's four brothers were the director's first cousins.\n\nEducation\nAs the only male heir to the Lawson-Aldrich family line, Aldrich was under considerable pressure to compete successfully with his numerous cousins in a family of high achievers.Following family tradition and expectations, Aldrich was educated at Moses Brown School in Providence from 1933 to 1937. There he served as captain of the track and football teams and was elected president of his senior class.\nFailing to matriculate to Yale due to mediocre grades, Aldrich attended the University of Virginia from 1937 to 1941, majoring in economics. He continued to excel in sports and played a leading role in campus clubs and fraternities.During the Great Depression, the adolescent Aldrich began to question the justice of his family's \"politics and power\" which clashed with his growing sympathies with left-wing social and political movements of the 1930s. Aldrich's disaffection from the Aldrich-Rockefeller right-wing social and political orientation contributed to a growing tension between father and son.Having satisfactorily demonstrated his aptitude for a career in finance, Aldrich defied his father by dropping out of college in his senior year without taking a degree.Aldrich approached his uncle Winthrop W. Aldrich, who got his 23-year-old nephew a job at RKO Studios as a production clerk at $25 a week. For this act of defiance, Aldrich was promptly disinherited. Aldrich reciprocated by expunging public records of his connection with the Aldrich-Rockefeller clan, while stoically accepting the breach. He rarely mentioned or invoked his family thereafter. It has been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich — and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"\n\nRKO Pictures: 1941–1943\nAt the age of 23, Aldrich began work at RKO Pictures as a production clerk, an entry-level position, after declining an offer through his Rockefeller connections to enter the studio as an associate producer.He married his first wife, Harriet Foster, a childhood sweetheart, shortly before he departed for Hollywood in May 1941.Though the smallest of Hollywood's top studios, RKO could boast an impressive roster of directors (George Cukor, John Ford and Howard Hawks) as well as movie stars (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and the Marx Brothers). The 23-year-old Aldrich assumed his duties shortly after Orson Welles, at 26, signed a six-movie contract with RKO after the release of the widely acclaimed Citizen Kane (1941).When the United States entered the Second World War in December 1941, Aldrich was inducted into the Air Force Motion Picture Unit, but was quickly discharged when an old football injury disqualified him for military service. The film studios' manpower shortage allowed Aldrich to win assignments as third- or second-tier director's assistant to learn the basics of filmmaking.\n\nSecond assistant director\nIn just two years he participated on two dozen movies with well-known directors. He was second assistant director on Joan of Paris (1942, directed by Robert Stevenson), The Falcon Takes Over (1942, directed by Irving Reis), The Big Street (1942), directed by Reis, Bombardier (1943, directed by Richard Wallace), Behind the Rising Sun (1943, directed by Edward Dmytryk),  A Lady Takes a Chance (1943, directed by William A. Seiter), The Adventures of a Rookie (1943, directed by Leslie Goodwins), Gangway for Tomorrow (1Mahla freed. She demands that Kincaid be released unharmed, or she will not marry Hussein. Hussein reluctantly does so. Kincaid and his men infiltrate the wedding ceremony, and fighting breaks out. Mahla's tribe switches sides, and Hussein is killed.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was the first of a two-picture deal Columbia Pictures signed with Norma Productions, the company of Burt Lancaster and Harold Hecht. (The second was to be Small Wonder, a film in which Lancaster would not appear.)It was originally a Western story by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck which concerned conflict between the US cavalry and Apaches. Producer Harold Hecht and star Burt Lancaster then decided that \"John Ford and other Hollywood operators have so effectively decimated the Apache population\" that they hired writer A.I. Bezzerides to reimagine the story with a Foreign Legion setting which wound up involving the Rif War (1911-1927). Roland Kibbee and Frank Davis were hired to rewrite the script to make it more comedic.The film was shot in February 1950 at the Columbia Ranch in the San Fernando Valley and on location in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nTen Tall Men at the American Film Institute Catalog\nTen Tall Men at IMDb\nTen Tall Men at the TCM Movie Database\nPassage 7:\nEnteng the Dragon\nEnteng the Dragon is a 1988 Philippine comedy film directed by Romy Villaflor and written by Tony S.

Enteng is known for his humor, and a journalist and star reporter named Rowena (Dang Cecilio) was interested to cover his story after her Editor-in-Chief saw him as worthy of human interest.

After some reluctance by its studio Vera Cruz, Barreto shot it in 1952. After its release it was national and international success, and won several awards, including the Adventure Film Award at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. It was poorly received in retrospect despite being praised by the time of its release and started a subgenre in Brazilian cinema.\n\nCast\nAlberto Ruschel as Teodoro\nMarisa Prado as Olívia\nMilton Ribeiro as Galdino\nVanja Orico as Maria Clódia\nAdoniran Barbosa as Mané Mole\n\nProduction\nIn 1950, Lima Barreto joined the film studio Companhia Cinematográfica Vera Cruz invited by its then president Alberto Cavalcanti. After releasing two documentaries successfully for the studio, Painel and Santuário, Barreto get the chance to direct a feature film. With the idea to shoot a film about Lampião since the early 1940s, he only commenced to shoot it in 1952 after some reluctance by Franco Zampari, Vera Cruz's founder. Although he went to Bahia and did some research there, it was shot in Vargem Grande do Sul, São Paulo, with a production that lasted nine months due to internal conflicts.\n\nReception\nO Cangaceiro was released on January 20, 1953, and was  a public success; it grossed ₢$30 million (about US$1.5 million) in the 24 Brazilian theaters in which it spent six weeks. After its national success, it was distributed to over 80 countries, becoming one of the most internationally successful Brazilian films—a feat uncommon in that time. It led it to be considered Vera Cruz's \"high point\" and its \"most important production\" by Georges Sadoul, author of Dictionary of Films, and by O Estado de S. Paulo's Luiz Zanin, respectively.After winning several Brazilian awards, the film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, where it was \"much liked for its original and truly national flavour.\" O Cangaceiro won the Best Adventure Film Award, making it the first Brazilian film to win a prize at Cannes, and received a special mention to Gabriel Migliori's musical composition. At the Edinburgh International Film Festival it was awarded the Best Film.It received mixed commentaries since its release. It was once voted the best Brazilian film in 1968 by National Film Institute's magazine Revista Film Cultura. Sadoul declared, \"Lima Barreto well conveys a sense of poetry of the open desert space of the Sertão and makes this story lively and suspenseful\". After praising its cast performances and its \"thrilling\" musical score, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said, \"This [O] Cangaceiro is a picture that will cause the Western fans to rub their eyes.\" However, Cinema Novo representants—mainly Glauber Rocha—would criticize it for borrowing too much the style of American films. Critics also went on to comment on its \"sociological inaccuracies.\"\n\nLegacy\nIt is the first film to mix cangaço with Western, starting a genre called \"Nordestern\" —an amalgam of the words \"Nordeste\" (Northeast) and \"Western\". It would be followed by successful films such as Carlos Coimbra's A Morte Comanda o Cangaço (1960), Lampião, o Rei do Cangaço (1964) and Corisco, o Diabo Louro (1969), and Aurélio Teixeira's Os Três Cabras de Lampião. It also established cangaço as a subgenre in Brazilian cinema; subsequently, cangaço would be featured as a theme from comedy—such as Os Três Cangaceiro and O Lamparina—to pornochanchada films—As Cangaceiras Eróticas and A Ilha das Cangaceiras Virgens. Also, Ruschel and Ribeiro would reprise the role of \"good cangaceiro\" and \"bad cangaceiro\" in other films.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFinally (CeCe Peniston song)\n\"Finally\" is a song by American singer-songwriter CeCe Peniston, released in September 1991 as her debut single from her first album, Finally (1992). It received critical acclaim, becoming Peniston's first (and biggest) hit song, peaking at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 in January 1992. It is also her only US top-ten hit to date. Prior to that, the track was a major success on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it spent two weeks at number one in late 1991. In addition, a dance remix of the song, the \"Choice Mix\", peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in March 1992. The remix appeared on many dance music compilations in the early '90s. Its music video was directed by Claude Borenzweig.\n\nBackground and release\nPeniston grew up in Phoenix and began writing pop songs during school. The words of \"Finally\"  were purportedly penned during a chemistry class, while thinking about dating in college. In 1989 and 1990, she won the Miss Black Arizona pageant, and took the Miss Galaxy pageant a short time later.\nHer music career began in January 1991, when Felipe \"DJ Wax Dawg\" Delgado, her friend and a record producer based also in Phoenix, asked Peniston to record back-up vocals for Tonya Davis, a rapper known as Overweight Pooch. Though Overweight Pooch's album flopped on the market, Manny Lehman (a DJ and executive producer) had noticed the powerful voice of the back-up vocalist, Peniston. He offered Delgado a chance to produce a track for Peniston to cultivate her potential as a solo artist. Delgado called hometown friend and music producer, Rodney K. Jackson, to help co-produce Peniston's single, which would become \"Finally\".\n\nPeniston was 21 years old when \"Finally\" was released. When asked about the song in a 2012 interview, Peniston said, \"It was actually a poem that I had turned into a song, and it was the very first song that I had written. I was doing backup for someone else, and they asked if I had something else and I was like yeah, something I’ve written, and I didn’t know if they’d like it. You know, you don’t really understand your gifts at that point, so when he said I have a hit, I was just like okay. At the time I didn’t understand what it means to have a number one song, I really had no idea. They said you have a hit on your hands and you’re going to have to go to Europe. All of a sudden I was traveling the world, one show turned into two, that little girl from Arizona was going everywhere! You know, I had been here and there, a couple of trips, but nothing at all like this. It was overwhelming.\"\nNew versions of \"Finally\" were released in 1997 and 2011.\n\nComposition\nThe remix of this song is based on the piano riff from the house music classic \"Someday\" by CeCe Rogers from 1987. The song is performed in the key of B minor with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, following a chord progression of G(9) – G/A – Bm, and Peniston's vocals span from B3 to D5. In 2017, Peniston told about recording the song, \"It was a great experience making this song. I remember being in the studio with producer Felipe Delgado, and we didn't have the second verse written. I had forgotten some of the lyrics and just ad-libbed some of them–that \"yeah-yeah\" part. They ended up sampling that, and it became a big part of the song. It's amazing how those raw moments happen.\"\n\nChart performance\nThe song was released in the fall of 1991, where it became an instant dance anthem, peaking in October at the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the United States for two weeks, while achieving respectable chart success overseas the following year. The song was re-released in the United Kingdom, where it reached a new peak of number two in its second week at the UK Singles Chart, on March 22, 1992. It was held off reaching the top spot by Shakespears Sister's \"Stay\". \"Finally\" also charted at number-one in Zimbabwe and on the RPM Dance/Urban chart in Canada, and number eight in Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, the song reached number three in Belgium and number five in the Netherlands and Ireland. Following the single's success, Peniston completed her first album, Finally, in two months. The album was critically acclaimed, and Peniston celebrated a year-long run of awards success including the Billboard Award for Best New Artist (dance), and three ASCAP awards amongst numerous others. The song \"Finally\" has sold over 3 million copies to date.\n\nCritical reception\nJ.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun felt the song \"is a delightful surprise, marrying a muscular, insinuating groove to Peniston's soulful, insistent vocals.\" Larry Flick from Billboard complimented it as \"a delicious peak-hour houser that is in a vein similar to Alison Limerick's \"Where Love Lives\". Peniston wraps her lovely alto around a hook that seeps into the brain and body and never lets go.\" He also remarked that Peniston \"proves her potential as a future diva on this brain-embedding, spine-stirring house anthem.\" Amy Linden from Entertainment Weekly commented, \"The slammin’ house/pop single of the moment? It's CeCe Peniston's \"Finally,\" and its sheer joy and verve.\" She explained further, \"Grooving in the fabulousness of her newfound Mr. Right, and sorta amazed that it all happened, she wails deliciously, making you believe that true love will conquer all and that someday your prince (or princess) will come.\" Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report described it as a \"bright and infectious\" debut release and concluded, \"I had a preview of this song back in July and have been in love with it ever since!\" Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times viewed it as \"lively\".Pan-European magazine Music & Media stated that \"this newcomer gives further evidence that dance is still developing into a more song-oriented direction. The violins give the tune the ambiance of \"Backstabbers\" by the O'Jays.\" Andy Beevers from Music Week complimented it as an \"extremely classy and catchy garage-styled debut\". A reviewer from People Magazine felt that it's \"overflowing with verve and loaded up with joyous girlie glee\", noting the \"ecstatic, beat-heavy power\" of the track. James Hamilton from the RM Dance Update labeled it as \"cheerful wailing\" and a \"ex-Miss America's catchy Crystal Waters-type US pop smash\". Adam Higginbotham from Select declared \"Finally\"31 in Toronto. All three of these shows had a similar format: there was an exclusively acoustic set, with Q&A before the show.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFallow deer\nDama is a genus of deer in the subfamily Cervinae, commonly referred to as fallow deer.\n\nName\nThe name fallow is derived from the deer's pale brown colour. The Latin word dāma or damma, used for roe deer, gazelles, and antelopes, lies at the root of the modern scientific name, as well as the German Damhirsch, French daim, Dutch damhert, and Italian daino. In Serbo-Croatian, the name for the fallow deer is jelen lopatar (\"shovel deer\"), due to the form of its antlers. The Modern Hebrew name of the fallow deer is yachmur (יחמור).\n\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe genus includes two extant species:\n\nExtant species\nSome taxonomists classify the Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica), while others, such as the IUCN, treat it as a separate species (D. mesopotamica).\nPassage 2:\nMoose\nThe moose (PL: moose; used in North America) or elk (PL: elk or elks; used in Eurasia) (Alces alces) is the only species in the genus Alces. It is the largest and heaviest extant species of deer. Most adult male moose have distinctive broad, palmate (\"open-hand shaped\") antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic (\"twig-like\") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time. It has been reintroduced to some of its former habitats. Currently, most moose occur in Canada, Alaska, New England (with Maine having the most of the lower 48 states), New York State, Fennoscandia, the Baltic states, Poland, Kazakhstan, and Russia.\nIts diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. Predators of moose include wolves, bears, humans, wolverines (rarely), and orcas (while feeding underwater). Unlike most other deer species, moose do not form herds and are solitary animals, aside from calves who remain with their mother until the cow begins estrus (typically at 18 months after birth of the calf), at which point the cow chases them away. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive, and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males competing for a female.\n\nEtymology and naming\nAlces alces is called a \"moose\" in North American English, but an \"elk\" in British English. The word \"elk\" in North American English refers to a completely different species of deer, Cervus canadensis, also called the wapiti. A mature male moose is called a bull, a mature female a cow, and an immature moose of either sex a calf.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the etymology of the species is \"of obscure history\". In Classical Antiquity, the animal was known as ἄλκη álkē in Greek and alces in Latin, words probably borrowed from a Germanic language or another language of northern Europe. By the 8th century, during the Early Middle Ages, the species was known as Old English: elch, elh, eolh, derived from the Proto-Germanic: *elho-, *elhon- and possibly connected with the Old Norse: elgr. Later, the species became known in Middle English as elk, elcke, or elke, appearing in the Latinized form alke, with the spelling alce borrowed directly from Latin: alces. Noting that elk \"is not the normal phonetic representative\" of the Old English elch, the Oxford English Dictionary derives elk from Middle High German: elch, itself from Old High German: elaho.The word \"elk\" has cognates in other Indo-European languages, e.g. elg in Danish/Norwegian; älg in Swedish; alnis in Latvian; eland in Dutch/Frisian; Elch in German; and łoś in Polish. In the continental European languages, these forms of the word \"elk\" always refer to Alces alces.\nThe youngest elk bones in Great Britain were found in Scotland and are roughly 3,900 years old. The elk was probably extinct on the island before 900 AD. The word \"elk\" remained in usage because of English-speakers' familiarity with the species in Continental Europe; however, without any living animals around to serve as a reference, the meaning became rather vague, and by the 17th century \"elk\" had a meaning similar to \"large deer\". Dictionaries of the 18th century simply described \"elk\" as a deer that was \"as large as a horse\".Confusingly, the word \"elk\" is used in North America to refer to a different animal, Cervus canadensis, which is also called by the Algonquian indigenous name, \"wapiti\". The British began colonizing America in the 17th century, and found two common species of deer for which they had no names. The wapiti appeared very similar to the red deer of Europe (which itself was then almost extinct in Southern Britain) although it was much larger and was not red; the two species are indeed closely related, though distinct behaviorally and genetically. The moose was a rather strange-looking deer to the colonists, and they often adopted local names for both. In the early days of American colonization, the wapiti was often called a gray moose and the moose was often called a black moose, but early accounts of the animals varied wildly, adding to the confusion.The word \"moose\" had first entered English by 1606 and is borrowed from the Algonquian languages (compare the Narragansett moos and Eastern Abenaki mos; according to early sources, these were likely derived from moosu, meaning \"he strips off\"), and possibly involved forms from multiple languages mutually reinforcing one another. The Proto-Algonquian form was *mo·swa.Early European explorers in North America, particularly in Virginia where there were no moose, called the wapiti \"elk\" because of its size and resemblance to familiar-looking deer like the red deer. The moose resembled the \"German elk\" (the moose of continental Europe), which was less familiar to the British colonists. For a long time neither species had an official name, but were called a variety of things. Eventually, in North America the wapiti became known as an elk while the moose retained its indigenous name. In 1736, Samuel Dale wrote to the Royal Society of Great Britain:\n\nThe common light-grey moose, called by the Indians, Wampoose, and the large or black-moose, which is the beast whose horns I herewith present. As to the grey moose, I take it to be no larger than what Mr. John Clayton, in hiss. Agriculture was, however, allowed within the forest boundaries only under severe restrictions; assarting, or enclosing and clearing new land for agriculture, was completely prohibited until 1215–16.During the early Norman period, the penalties for killing game were blinding, mutilation or execution. These savage punishments were gradually replaced by huge fines, and in 1215, the Magna Carta reduced the maximum penalty for breaking forest law nationally to fines or imprisonment. Ranulf de Blondeville, the 6th Earl, issued a charter in 1215–16 which granted a more humane legal code for the Cheshire hunting forests.This charter also, for the first time, conceded to the barons and their knights and freeholders the \"right to assart their lands within the arable area of the forest and to grow crops on land formerly cultivated and free from wood without payment.\" Within the Forests of Mara and Mondrem, custom did not, however, follow the charter, a fine of 5 shillings per acre in Mondrem or 6 shillings 8 pence per acre in Mara being paid at the time of enclosure. Later, a licence was also required to assart forest land, which required the payment of a further fee and was very unpopular. Enclosure and assarting in Mara and Mondrem during this period is poorly documented, but is known to have occurred at Frodsham, Weaverham and Darnhall.\n\nAfter the Earls\nAfter the lapse of the Chester earldom in 1237, the forest rights passed to the Crown and the monarch's heir was given the title of Earl of Chester. Although Edward I hunted in the forest, the sport became less important, and the forests were used for timber production and as a source of revenue from taxes, fees and fines. In 1300, Edward I confirmed Ranulf de Blondeville's charter of 1215–16, but in the mid-14th century, Edward of Woodstock, the Black Prince, introduced various restrictive measures, which led to a large number of complaints recorded in the Black Prince's Register of 1351. Agricultural exploitation of the eastern edge of the forest was hampered by outbreaks of Black Death at Over, Little Budworth and Vale Royal Abbey in 1349, 1361 and 1369. The Old Pale and Eddisbury Hill were enclosed in the 14th century, to retain deer.\n\nThe northerly Forest of Mara remained wooded in the 14th century, and still retained a population of wild boar, lynx and wolves. By that date, however, large areas of the southerly Forest of Mondrem had been cleared. The remaining Mondrem woodland in the mid-14th century appears to have been concentrated in the north around Castle Northwich, Hartford and Winnington, and to a lesser extent in the south east around Aston juxta Mondrum, Calveley, Cholmondeston, Church Minshull, Poole and Wettenhall. Extensive assarting by Vale Royal Abbey made a major contribution to the loss of Mondrem woodland before the abbey's dissolution. The proximity to the medieval salt wiches of Nantwich and Middlewich, with their wood-fuelled salt pans, might also have been a factor.\nDeer continued to be hunted in the 17th century; a large area at New Pale was enclosed at this time for the retention of deer. James I, on a royal visit to Cheshire in August 1617, hunted in the forest, describing it as \"this delectable place\". From the early 18th century, however, the focus of hunting moved away from deer; Tarporley Hunt Club was founded in 1762, and the local gentry hunted hares and later foxes.\n\nDisafforestation\nThe late 18th and early 19th centuries saw much of the surviving forest enclosed. A total of 7,755 acres (3,138 ha) in the south of the Forest of Mara, by then known as Delamere Forest, remained nominally a hunting forest until the early 19th century. In 1812, an Enclosure Act was passed disafforesting the remaining forest (that is, returning its legal status to ordinary land) and transferring ownership of the remnant half to the Crown and half to surrounding major landowners. Very little ancient woodland now survives, mainly concentrated on the banks of the Weaver and within steep cloughs running into that river, although there are also pockets of old, semi-natural woodland elsewhere, such as Cocked Hat Covert, near Little Budworth, and Dorfold Park, near Acton.\n\nAdministration\nEach of the Cheshire hunting forests was administered by a master-forester on behalf of the Earl. For the Forests of Mara and Mondrem, this hereditary position was given by Ranulf le Meschin, the 3rd Earl, to Ranulf or Ralph de Kingsley in 1123, and it passed by marriage to the Launcelyn family and later to the Done family of Utkinton and Tarporley. Sixteen Dones held the position over nearly four centuries. In 1662, the master-forestership passed to the Crewe family and then to the Ardernes, who held it until the disafforestation in 1812. The position was symbolised by a black horn, which was given to the Kingsleys in the 12th century; now known as the \"Delamere Horn\", it is in the collection of the Grosvenor Museum. The master-foresters answered to the Chester justiciar, who was responsible for the administration of forest law across all three Cheshire forests.The privileges claimed by the Mara and Mondrem master-forester were set out in detail by Richard Done in the 14th century. They included the right shoulder of all deer killed in hunting; windfallen and felled timber within the demesne wood; swarms of bees, sparrowhawks, merlins and hobbies found throughout the forest; and the right of pannage, or feeding pigs in the forest. He also claimed halfpence per head of cattle and goats found straying within the forest between Michaelmas and Martinmas, the payments made for the agistment of hogs between Martinmas and Christmas, as well as the pick of the property forfeited by poachers. The master-forester had a lodge, known as the \"Chamber of the Forest\", in which he occasionally stayed; it was built in Peckforton in 1351 and later moved to Eddisbury Hill.A large staff supported the Mara and Mondrem master-forester, which is known in the mid-14th century to have included eight underforesters and two garçons who administered particular districts of the forest, assuming much of the role of the county sergeants within the forest bounds. Additionally, agisters collected monies charged for grazing, verderers attended the forest courts, and inspectors termed \"regarders\", huntsmen and kennelmen were also employed.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Cheshire\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSven Nys\nSven Nys (Dutch: [ˌsfɛˈnɛis]; born 17 June 1976) is a former professional cyclist competing in cyclo-cross and mountain bike. With two world championships, seven world cups, and over 140 competitive victories, he is considered one of the best cyclo-cross racers of his generation, and remains a prominent figure in cyclo-cross. Apart from cyclo-cross, Nys is also fivefold national mountainbike champion, and has competed in that discipline in two Olympic games.\n\nCareer overview\nEarly years\nBorn in Bonheiden, Belgium, Nys began racing BMX at the age of 8. He won eight BMX national titles before switching to cyclocross, a more popular sport in Belgium. He won the under-23 world championship in 1997 and 1998, beating another Belgian, Bart Wellens. Nys moved to the elite category in 1998–1999, joining the Dutch Rabobank team.\n\nBecoming elite\nIn the elite class he won the Superprestige competition and came third in the national championships. The next season, he won the Superprestige again, ended the World Cup as leader and became Belgian champion. This made him favourite for the 2000 world championship. But his Rabobank management told him not to beat his teammate, the Dutchman Richard Groenendaal. Groenendaal sprinted away from the start and Nys was forced to hold back and not help another Belgian, Mario De Clercq, chase him. Groenendaal won and Nys, who came third, was criticised in Belgium for choosing team over country. The Royal Belgian Cycling League demanded an explanation. It became more forgiving but the head coach, Erik De Vlaeminck, remained unconvinced.Nys blamed an injury for not winning a season-long competition or championship in 2000–2001. A year later he won the World Cup and the Superprestige again. In the world championships that year he came third after being outsprinted by De Clercq and Tom Vannoppen. The following season Nys won the Superprestige for the fourth time as well as the Gazet van Antwerpen trophy for a first time. He became Belgian champion again, but Wellens won the world championship and the World Cup.\nWellens dominated 2003–2004. Nys' chance for the World Cup ended when other Belgians sprinted past him, taking points. Nys was angry that his countrymen had allowed Groenendaal, a Dutchman, to win the World Cup rather than him. That evening Nys decided from then on to ride for himself.\n\nThis is war. Thanks Vannoppen, thanks Van der Linden. This is the last thing I have done for the Belgian team. They can all go to hell. [...] Apparently there are some who take joy out of me not winning the World Cup. I know who and will take that into account next year. National team coach Rudy De Bie told me that he has never seen anything like this before. Our country loses the World Cup today.\n\nThe cannibal\nNys won everything of importance and at the end of 2004–2005 won the national and world championships, ended number one in the UCI rankings and World Cup, the Superprestige and the Gazet van Antwerpen Trophy. He is the only cyclo-crosser to achieve such dominance. Nys came close to repeating the feat the following season but he gave up in the world championship after a fall on the last lap.\nNys won all eight Superprestige races in 2006–2007. In the Superprestige he won 13 races from Hoogstraten in 2005 to Asper Gaver in 2007. That season he won the World Cup and the Gazet van Antwerpen trophy again, but neither the national or world championship. The national involved a lot of running, not Nys' talent, and were won by Wellens. At the world championship in Hooglede-Gits Nys fell three times: over Wellens, who fell because a television motor had hit one of the road markers; over Erwin Vervecken; and because of an error of his own. He finished 11th.\nThe following season, Nys won the World Cup, the Superprestige and the Gazet van Anterwerpen trophy again. He also won his fifth national championship. The Dutchman Lars Boom became champion of the world and Zdeněk Štybar took the silver, both barely 22 at the time. Nys, already nearing 32, came third.\n\nNys switched teams from Rabobank to Landbouwkrediet-Tönissteiner. Niels Albert, 2008's U23 world champion, joined the elite category that season, giving Nys another opponent. But Nys won all the season-long competitions and the national championship. Albert won the world championship, Štybar was second and Nys third. The Belgian press referred to Albert, Štybar and Nys as De Grote Drie (The Big Three), it was clear that Nys' years of absolute domination were behind him.\nIn his second mountain bike race Nys won the Belgian championship and then came ninth at the Olympic Games in 2008. On 31 December 2006 Nys won his 150th race with the elites, at Diegem. Four years later, he scored his 300th career win at the Koppenbergcross, one of the toughest races in the season.\nNys was appointed as a member of the inaugural UCI Athletes' Commission in 2011.In 2013 Nys won the world championship a second time. He said his career was now complete.On 10 February 2013, Nys won his 60th race in the Superprestige.On 22 November 2015, Nys won the Koksijde round of the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup in Belgium, his fiftieth victory in the series. His win came seventeen years and a day after his first World Cup victory.Sven Nys called a halt to his career on 5–6 March 2016 at an event called \"Merci Sven\" which was held at the Antwerp Sportpaleis (Belgium).\n\nPost cycling career\nAfter ending his active cyclocross career Nys bought the cyclocross team Telenet–Fidea Lions of which he is the general manager.

Kuwait under 23 Could also be called as Kuwait Olympic Team. Kuwait under 23 also represents its country in the Olympic Games. From 1900 to 1976 Kuwait did not qualify for the Olympic Games but in 1980 Kuwait qualified for the Olympic Games in China and had the best record of their country finishing in the quarter-finals of that Olympic games. Kuwait missed the 1984 and 1988 Olympic games. But in 1992 Kuwait finally qualified for the 1992 Olympic Games in Spain, however with their poor performance, Kuwait was eliminated in the first round of that tournament. After that Kuwait had missed the 1996 Olympic Games that was hosted by the United States, Kuwait then qualified for the 2000 Olympic Games in Australia and that was the last time Kuwait qualified for the Olympic Games. Kuwait has never won the GCC U-23 Championship but their best finish at that Competition was as a runner up in 2010. In the 2022 Asian U-23 qualification Cup Group D, Kuwait managed to defeat Bangladesh by 1-0 and Saudi Arabia by 2-1, this resulted in Kuwait to qualify for the 2022 Asian U-23 Cup.\n\nHonours\nRegional honours\nGCC U-23 ChampionshipRunners-up (2): 2010, 2015\n\nMinor\n2018 Olympic Return Cup\n\nHistory\nKuwait’s first-ever qualification to the Olympic games was in the 1980 Olympic Games which Kuwait were eliminated in the quarter-finals of that Olympic games.

She represented Great Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics and England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games and 2002 Commonwealth Games. She also rode at the 1998, 1999, and 2000 UCI Road World Championships and on the track at the 2001 and 2002 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\n\nPersonal life\nSymington was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, lived in Aylestone and she now lives in Nottingham. She had competed as a javelin thrower as a junior, and she was a member of the national triathlon team prior to becoming a full-time cyclist. Symington started her elite triathlon career whilst combining studying for a master's degree with a spell serving in the police, having previously graduated from Loughborough University with a degree in sports science.\n\nPost cycling\nSymington retired from competition after the 2004 Olympics: following this she worked in business for two years, before returning to the sports world through working as a performance advisor for UK Sport. She was subsequently appointed performance director of Archery GB in February 2009. In February 2015 England Netball announced that she would join them as their performance director the following month. In that role she helped the England national netball team to its first Commonwealth gold medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

He is perhaps most famous for having been part of the 1978 World Cup winning squad.\n\nClub career\nValencia started his club career at Gimnasia y Esgrima de Jujuy but was soon transferred to Talleres de Córdoba, the club at which he would play most of his career.\nAt Talleres, Valencia suffered the disappointment of finishing runner-up in Nacional 1977, finishing third in Metropolitano 1980, and losing the semi-finals on four occasions.\nIn 1986, he  had a spell in Ecuadorian football with Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito, but only stayed one year before returning to Talleres for a further two seasons.\nIn 1988, he left Talleres to play for third division club Guaraní Antonio Franco in Misiones, Argentina. After a short spell in the lower leagues, he made a brief return to the first division with Rosario Central in 1989 before moving to Bolivia where he played for Club Jorge Wilstermann and then Club San José.\nAt San José, he again experienced the disappointment of being a losing finalist on two occasions; in the 1991 Clausura and the 1992 season. He also got his first taste of Copa Libertadores football, but with little success, as San José finished bottom of their group in both 1992 and 1993.\nValencia retired from club football in 1993 at the age of 37.\n\nInternational career\nThe highlight of Valencia's footballing career came in 1978 when he was selected to represent Argentina at the FIFA World Cup tournament. Although he featured in the first game, he was dropped due to a tactical reshuffle by manager César Luis Menotti. He was unlucky to miss out on the World Cup final in the Monumental stadium, but he did play a part in helping Argentina win their first World Cup.\nValencia was selected to play for Argentina at 1982 World Cup, but the team had a disappointing campaign, eliminated in the second group phase. He retired from international football at the end of the tournament, having represented his country 41 times, scoring five goals.\n\nHonours\nClub\nTalleres de Córdoba\n\nCopa Hermandad: 1977\nLiga Cordobesa de Fútbol: 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979\n\nInternational\nArgentina\n\nFIFA World Cup: 1978\nPassage 2:\nMariano Campodónico\nMariano Alejandro Campodónico (born 4 May 1974) is a retired Argentine footballer who played as a forward and current manager. He is the brother of former footballer Pablo Campodónico.\n\nCareer\nCampodónico started his career in 1994, his first club was Banfield, he remained with them for four years before joining Platense with whom he made 17 appearances. 1999 saw Campodónico leave Platense and complete a move to San Martín (SJ) before subsequently agreeing to join Arsenal de Sarandí in 2000 and El Porvenir in 2001. In 2002, Campodónico moved out of Argentina for the first-team as he agreed to sign for Venezuelan Primera División club Caracas, however his spell with Caracas was short as he soon departed to join Ecuadorian Serie A side Aucas.One year later he left to join fellow Ecuadorian team Deportivo Quito. Moves to Gimnasia, Chiapas, Ferro Carril Oeste and Belgrano followed between 2003 and 2007. In 2004, Campodónico, playing for Ferro Carril Oeste scored twice against Sarmiento. Sarmiento's goalkeeper was Campodónico's own brother, Pablo. Mariano told reporters that \"this was the worst thing that's happened to me in my football career\". In 2006, while playing for Belgrano, Campodónico was sentenced to eight days in prison for making \"obscene gestures\" at the opposing team during a football game.He joined Nueva Chicago in 2007 and made 12 appearances before leaving not long after joining to complete a transfer to San Martín (T). 6 goals in 10 appearances followed for San Martín (T) before Campodónico moved to Paraguay to play for Cerro Porteño. He was with Cerro Porteño for one season, 2008, before eventually joining Aldosivi, which meant he was at the same team as his brother, Pablo, for the first-time. After leaving Aldosivi, he joined All Boys before then moving to Belgrano (second spell), Temperley and Talleres. Campodónico played for Mitre in 2015 and Cañuelas in 2016 before announcing his retirement.\n\nCoaching career\nRetiring in the summer 2017, Campodónico began his coaching career at his last club as a player, Cañuelas, where he was appointed manager on 28 December 2017. However, he decided to resign on 19 June 2018.A few days after leaving Cañuelas, Campodónico was appointed manager of Club Luján at the end of June 2018. After only two victories, four draws and seven defeats, he was fired 15 October 2018.On 3 February 2019, Campodónico was appointed manager of Sacachispas FC. He left his position on 16 September 2019.After Israel Damonte was appointed manager of Huracán on 3 January 2020, Campodónico also joined the club as his assistant coach, alongside his brother, Pablo Campodónico, who was appointed goalkeeper coach. They left in March 2021\n\nHonours\nClub\nSan Martín (T)Primera B Nacional (1): 2007–08\nPassage 3:\nLuis Artime\nLuis Artime (born 2 December 1938) is an Argentine former footballer, who played as a striker, and scored more than 1,000 goals during his career. His son Luis Fabián Artime is also a retired Argentine footballer who played in the 1990s.\n\nClub career\nArtime was born in Parque Civit in Mendoza Province. He had a remarkably successful career in club football, he was top scorer four times in the Argentine league, three times in the Uruguayan league and once in the Copa Libertadores. He won one Argentine league title, three Uruguayan league titles and the Copa Libertadores in 1971.\nArtime started his career at Club Atlético Atlanta but in 1962 he was transferred to Argentine giants River Plate where he became the top scorer in Argentina on three occasions. In 1966 he moved to Independiente where he helped the team to win the Nacional 1967, he was also topscorer in the tournament.\nInhalf of his spell in Italy's capital, he was partnered with compatriot Hernán Crespo in the front-line. However, López suffered from injury problems during his time at Lazio. During the 2000–2001 UEFA Champions League, he scored a direct goal from a corner kick against Anderlecht in the Stadio Olimpico.\nAfter Crespo left for Inter in the summer of 2002, López was partnered with newcomer Bernardo Corradi. They formed a solid partnership that yielded a combined 25 Serie A goals as Lazio finished 4th to qualify for the Champions League under new coach Roberto Mancini. The Argentine scored 15 of those goals, his best league tally during his years in Italy; the 4th-place finish for Lazio was also the best the club would achieve until 2011–12.\nIn December 2002 he made headlines during a Serie A clash with Inter that ended 3-3: after netting a hat-trick that gave his side a 3-0 lead, Claudio López improvised an \"Aserejé\" goal celebration with teammate Bernardo Corradi, inspired by the dance routine of Spanish band Las Ketchup. In an interview 13 years later, he explained that the unexpected celebration had happened because \"crazy Corradi enjoyed doing such things!\"In the UEFA Cup, López found the net twice to help his team reach the semi-finals, where they would be knocked out by the eventual winners, Jose Mourinho's FC Porto. The following season was less successful for Lazio as they only finished 6th in Serie A and crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage. Claudio López only found the net 4 times in 36 appearances. He did manage, however, to win his second piece of silverware with the Roman club as they overcame Juventus in the two-legged Coppa Italia Final.\n\nMexico, return to Racing\nLópez joined Club América for the 2004 Apertura, where he played in 17 games, scoring four goals. The following season, Clausura 2005 brought better results, with López scoring a total of 14 goals overall and helping the team to its tenth League championship in its history. It was his first and only league championship with any team. Claudio was instrumental to the team's success, also helping them win the CONCACAF Champions' Cup by scoring two goals in the Final over Tecos UAG. He played the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.\nIn 2007 López returned to Racing, 11 years after his departure from the club, and the country. In most of those games, usually coming in as a late sub, López scored several important goals.\n\nMajor League Soccer\nOn 7 March 2008, it was announced López had signed with the Kansas City Wizards on a free transfer. López fell under the league's designated player qualification, which means only the first $415,000 of his salary counted against Kansas City Wizards’ team salary cap. He later had his contract restructured to take him below designated player status.\n He scored on his debut for Kansas City against D.C. United on 29 March 2008.\nOn 23 February 2010 the Argentine striker left after two seasons Kansas City Wizards. \"We would have liked to have Claudio back in 2010, but unfortunately it became clear early in the contract negotiations that we could not give him what he desired,\" Wizards Manager Peter Vermes said.López was later signed by league rivals Colorado Rapids on 2 April 2010.After the 2010 MLS season Colorado declined López's contract option and Lopez elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. López became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.\n\nInternational career\nLópez had a distinguished career with Argentina. After winning a silver medal with the Under-23 team during the 1996 Summer Olympics, López made appearances in both the 1998 and 2002 World Cups. He scored a goal against the Netherlands in the 1998 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, when he kicked the ball between Edwin van der Sar's legs to tie the match temporarily, although Argentina were ultimately defeated 2–1.\n\nStyle of play\nA talented, hardworking, and well-rounded forward, with notable tactical intelligence and versatility, López was capable of playing anywhere along the front-line, as a striker, in a supporting role, and on the wing. He was highly regarded for his pace, technique, and dribbling skills, as well as his powerful striking ability with his left foot. He was also an effective set-piece and penalty taker. Throughout his career, he was known by the nickname \"El Piojo\", meaning \"the louse\".\n\nMedia\nLópez was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scopion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nInternational\nHonours\nValencia\n\nCopa del Rey: 1998–99\nSupercopa de España: 1999\nUEFA Intertoto Cup: 1998\nUEFA Champions League runner-up: 1999–2000,Lazio\n\nCoppa Italia: 2003–04\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2000América\n\nPrimera División de México: Clausura 2005\nCampeón de Campeones: 2005\nCONCACAF Champions' Cup: 2006Colorado Rapids\nMLS Cup: 2010\nMLS Eastern Conference: 2010\n\nSee also\nList of current MLS players with national team caps\nPassage 10:\n2002–03 Valencia CF season\nValencia CF did not succeed in defending their La Liga title, finishing in slumped 5th place.

Street (1824–81) was an English architect and architectural writer, whose designs were mainly in High Victorian Gothic style.  Born the son of a solicitor, he first worked in a law office, but was then articled to the architect Owen Browne Carter in Winchester.  Two years later, in 1844, he moved to London and worked in the office of George Gilbert Scott.  Here he also worked with George Frederick Bodley and William White.  Street established his own architectural practice in 1849, initially in London, and later in Wantage (then in Berkshire).  He was appointed as architect to the diocese of Oxford in 1850, and retained this position until his death. He married in 1852 and in that year moved to Oxford.  He returned to London in 1856 and maintained an office there for the remainder of his career.  He travelled extensively, visiting the Continent of Europe frequently.  Street was also a prolific writer on architectural subjects.  He was a member of the Royal Academy, and in 1874 was awarded the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, being its president in 1881.Most of Street's works were in relation to churches; designing new churches, restoring and making additions and alterations to existing churches, and designing fittings and furnishings for them.  He also designed domestic buildings, especially vicarages, and schools with houses for the schoolmaster.  He designed little in the way of public buildings, although towards the end of his life he designed what has been described as his \"greatest commission\", the Royal Courts of Justice in London.  Most of his works were in England, especially within and close to the diocese of Oxford, but examples of his work can be found throughout England, Wales and Ireland.  He also designed some buildings abroad, including a church in Constantinople.  Almost all his designs are in Gothic Revival style, in particular, in what is known as the High Victorian style.  This style came chronologically after the use of \"pure\" and \"correct\" use of features of English Gothic architecture, which had been championed by A. W. N. Pugin and the Ecclesiological Society.  High Victorian incorporated the use of polychromy, and elements of Continental forms of Gothic architecture.  Street died in 1881, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.This list contains details of Street's work on domestic buildings in England and Scotland.\n\nKey\nWorks\nSee also\nList of new churches by G.

Street\nPassage 3:\nRonald Reagan\nRonald Wilson Reagan ( RAY-gən; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, his presidency constituted the Reagan era, and he is considered one of the most prominent conservative figures in the United States.\nReagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and began to work as a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937, Reagan moved to California, where he became a film actor. From 1947 to 1952, Reagan served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild. In the 1950s, he worked in television and spoke for General Electric. From 1959 to 1960, he again served as the Screen Actors Guild's president. In 1964, \"A Time for Choosing\" gave Reagan attention as a new conservative figure. He was elected governor of California in 1966. During his governorship, he raised taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus, and cracked down harshly on university protests. After challenging and nearly defeating incumbent president Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican presidentialprestige in the 1980 Constitution.\nThe members of the Council of State were elected by the National Assembly and consisted of a chairman, deputy chairmen, a general secretary and other members. Council of State members could not concurrently be members of the Council of Ministers. The chairman of the Council of State was concurrently chairman of the National Defense Council (later the National Defense and Security Council) and commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces. The Council of State supervised the works of other institutions, most notably the Council of Ministers, the Supreme People's Organ for Control and the People's Councils at all levels. It also presided over the elections of the National Assembly. The office of Chairman of the Council of State, the head of state, was abolished in the 1992 Constitution and replaced by the office of President.\nThe importance of the president has not remained constant throughout Vietnamese history. For instance, while Hồ Chí Minh was ranked as first member of the Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam, his successor, Tôn Đức Thắng, was a symbolic figure with little power. The post of head of state was strengthened in the 1980 Constitution by the appointment of Trường Chinh who was, by order of precedence, the second-highest-ranking member in the Politburo, behind Lê Duẩn. The office of president retained the second highest rank in the Politburo order of precedence until Nguyễn Minh Triết was appointed in 2006; he ranked fourth in the Politburo hierarchy. The Politburo elected in the aftermath of the 11th National Party Congress (held in January 2011) by the Central Committee elected Trương Tấn Sang as the first-ranking member of the Politburo. This was the first time in Vietnamese history where the highest-ranking member of the Politburo does not hold post of either general secretary or chairman (was in existence from 1951 to 1969) of the party. Since Trương Tấn Sang is first-ranked member of the Politburo, he is the body's unofficial head. Politburo meetings are held regularly; decisions within the Politburo are made through collective decision-making, and policies are only enacted if a majority of Politburo members supports them.\n\nTerm of office\nThe president is selected for a term of office of five years. The term of office of the incumbent president continues until the president-elect takes office\nOn assuming office, the president takes the following oath before the parliament:\n\nIn my capacity as President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, I swear complete allegiance to the country, people, and constitution; to fulfill the tasks assigned by the State, and people\n\nDuties, powers and responsibilities\nThe president is the head of state of Vietnam, and his main priority is to represent Vietnam internally and externally. The officeholder is elected by the National Assembly of Vietnam, is responsible to it and reports to it. The tenure of the president is five years, the same as that of the National Assembly. The president continues to serve in his functions until the National Assembly elects a successor. The president has the following executive and legislative powers:\n\nTo promulgate laws, decree-laws and the Constitution,\nTo suspend the implementation or abrogation of the documents of the prime minister or the deputy prime minister which contravene the Constitution and the Laws\nTo act as the country's commander-in-chief and holds the office of Chairman of the National Defense and Security Council of Vietnam,\nTo convene meetings of the National Defense and Security Council of Vietnam,\nThe president shall take measures to protect the sovereignty of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam its independence and state integrity, and ensure concerted functioning and interaction of all bodies of state power,\nTo propose to the National Assembly the election or dismissal from office of the vice president, the prime minister, the Chief justice of the Supreme People's Court and the head of the Supreme People's Office of Supervision and Control,\nThe president has the right to preside over meetings of the Government of Vietnam,\nTo appoint or dismiss officials, staff and employees of the Office of the President,\nTo appoint or dismiss deputy prime ministers, ministers and other members of the government,\nTo proclaim a state of war or amnesty,\nOn the basis of a Standing Committee resolution, the president can order a general or partial mobilisation, or can proclaim a state of emergency nationwide or in a particular region,\nTo propose that the Standing Committee review its decree-laws and resolutions on matters stipulated in Points 8 and 9, Article 91, within the space of ten days following their adoption; if those decree-laws and resolutions are again passed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly with the country's president dissenting, the latter shall report the matter to the National Assembly for it to decide the issue at its nearest session,\nTo appoint or dismiss the deputy Chief justice and judges of the Supreme People's Court and the Deputy Director of the Supreme People's Office of Supervision and Control,\nTo appoint or dismiss the chief of general staff, vice chief of general staff, chief of the General Department of Politics and the vice chief of the General Political Department\nTo confer titles and ranks on senior officers of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and bestows \"diplomatic titles and ranks, and other State titles and ranks; to confer medals, badges and State honours and distinctions\",\nTo appoint and recall ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and receive foreign ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary, to negotiate and sign international agreements on behalf of the Socialist Republic with the heads of other states; he can approve or join international agreements, except in cases where a decision by the National Assembly is necessary,\nTo grant Vietnamese nationality, release from Vietnamese nationality, or deprive of Vietnamese nationality,\nTo hold Head of Steering Committee of the Central Judicial Reform,\nTo supervise the detection and handles all corrupt behaviors,\nTo hold Director of the Economic Council.The National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) is composed of the president, the prime minister and other members.

The decision-making process of the NDSC is that of a collective leadership. Among its powers is the right to mobilise all forces in the name of national defense, and in case of war the National Assembly can entrust the NDSC with special duties and powers.\n\nSuccession\nAccording to Article 93 of the Constitution of Vietnam (2013):\n\"When the President is incapacitated from work over a long period of time, the Vice President shall succeed as acting President. In case of vacancy of the Presidency, the Vice President shall serve as acting President until a new President is elected by the National Assembly.\"\n\nSee also\nList of presidents of Vietnam\nList of spouses of Vietnamese presidents\nVice President of Vietnam\nPrime Minister of Vietnam\nDeputy Prime Minister of Vietnam\nCouncil for National Defense and Security (Vietnam)\nGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam\nList of central officeholders in the Communist Party of Vietnam\nAir transports of heads of state and government\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The song's lyrics speak of a couple who \"found love in a hopeless place\".The song was a major worldwide success. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for ten non-consecutive weeks, becoming the longest running number-one single of 2011. The single also surpassed \"Umbrella\" and became Rihanna's longest running number one single. It was the singer's eleventh song to top the Hot 100, placing her in third place among female recording artists amassing the most number one singles. Outside of the United States, \"We Found Love\" topped the charts in 25 other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Russia, Scotland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

As of 2015, the single has sold 10.5 million copies worldwide, thus being one of the best selling singles of all time.\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Melina Matsoukas, depicts the singer as a drug-abusing thrill-seeker in a relationship that quickly spirals downward into addiction and domestic violence. The video won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards and MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. The song has been performed on both the UK and US versions of The X Factor, as well as at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards and the 2012 Brit Awards.

In September 2011, Rihanna again took to the social networking site to confirm that the plans had been scrapped, with the singer tweeting \"I [thought about] a [re-release], but LOUD is its own body of work! Plus [you] guys work so hard that [you] deserve to act brand new\". On September 19, 2011, Rihanna further provoked excitement amongst her followers when she posted that she was listening to the song, only to be re-tweeted by Calvin Harris, who replied \"Sometimes it feels like we find love in the most hopeless place\", suggesting that his response contained possible lyrics from the song. In an interview with Capital FM, Harris – who produced the track – explained that followers of Rihanna had sent messages to him regarding their expectations of the song, saying \"The song better not be rubbish\", which he interpreted as slightly threatening, but went on to say that \"it's all part of the fun\". In an interview for Q magazine, Harris said of the lyric, \"we found love in a hopeless place,\" \"It could have been Jumpin Jaks in Dumfries (Harris' home town), I don't know exactly what I was thinking about.\"\"We Found Love\" premiered in the United Kingdom on September 22, 2011, on Capital FM, and was sent for mainstream adds in the United States on October 11, 2011.

In the US market, it peaked at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. The December 2007 Observer Music Monthly asked Mika how it felt getting to No. 1 in the UK with this song. He replied: \"Very unreal. It still feels unreal. It's just a song I wrote in my room. By the time I'd written 'Grace Kelly' everything in my life had been called into question. Trying to find out what I was going to do with my life, trying to be a musician, to be independent, to give myself the remote chance of any kind of a relationship. I was just sorting every thing out in my head. That song sums it all up.\" It went to #1 on the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Norway and Turkey singles charts. The song was 82 in the French physical charts but number 2 in digital ones, and has more than 50,000 sales in the country. The song has more than 5 million sales.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nSee also\nList of number-one hits in Denmark\nList of number-one singles of 2007 (Ireland)\nList of number-one hits of 2007 (Italy)\nList of number-one hits in Norway\nList of number-one singles from the 2000s (UK)\nPassage 9:\nRoyal Blood discography\nEnglish rock duo Royal Blood have released three studio albums, two extended plays (EPs), fourteen singles and nineteen music videos.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nNobody for Everybody\nNobody for Everybody is the Japanese debut EP by South Korean girl group Wonder Girls. Its title song is \"Nobody\" ～あなたしか見えない～ (ノーバディ, Nōbadi), first released on their third Korean mini-album, The Wonder Years: Trilogy in 2008. This is the fourth language that \"Nobody\" has been released in; the song was first released in Korean and was followed by English and Chinese versions.\nThe EP consists of the Japanese version of \"Nobody\" as well as 2012 re-recordings of \"Nobody\" (in both Korean and English), \"Saying I Love You\", and \"You're Out\". These 2012 recordings include vocals of member Hyerim who entered the group in 2010, replacing the group's original member Sunmi.\n\nBackground\nAfter announcing the Wonder Girls as spokesmodels for the brand \"Marshpuff\" in Japan, JYPE requested that their Japanese record label, DefStar Records, listen to the Wonder Girls' released albums and singles before deciding on what song would be their debut in the country. The label had strong mutual interest in \"Nobody\", so it was chosen as the title song for their first Japanese album.In May 2012, the Wonder Girls officially announced their debut into the Japanese market with a Japanese version of \"Nobody\", \"Nobody ～あなたしか見えない～\". JYP JYPE stated: \"Wonder Girls have received numerous inquiries from Japan and [are] observing their advertisement and music business flourishing even without their official introduction.\"\nThe EP was released on July 25, 2012 in three different physical variants.\n\nTrack listing\nCharts\nPassage 2:\nAlina Margolis-Edelman\nAlina Margolis-Edelman (18 April 1922 – 23 March 2008) was a Polish physician, Holocaust survivor, and resistance fighter during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, who was forced to flee Poland during a revival of anti-Semitism in Poland in 1968. Joining Doctors Without Borders, she later helped found Doctors of the World, participating in medical missions in Africa and the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Simultaneously, she worked as a physician, practicing at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital and the Maternal-Infant Protection Service in Seine-Saint-Denis. In 1990, she returned to Poland, and began an association, \"Nobody's Children\", to fight against child abuse in Poland. She was the recipient of numerous awards and honors.\n\nEarly life\nAlina Margolis was born on 18 April 1922 in Łódź, Poland, to the Jewish \nphysician Anna (née Markson) and her husband, Aleksander Margolis, who was also a physician. Anna was the director of the radiology department and chief of the tubercular service division of Anna Maria Hospital. Aleksander, also known by the pseudonym Paweł Gart, was an internist and head of the Municipal General Hospital of Radogoszcz, and a member of the Łódź City Council, until he was executed by the Gestapo in 1939. After his death, the family was relocated to the Warsaw Ghetto, to await transport to Treblinka. Anna managed to enroll Alina in the Jewish School of Nursing founded by Lama Blum-Bielica, and she worked in one of the hospitals in the ghetto. When transport became imminent, Anna left the ghetto with the children, all of them posing as \"Aryan\". Anna placed her son in a Christian orphanage, and she went into hiding.Margolis hid with a Polish family who were anti-Semitic and who believed that she was the daughter of a Polish officer who was a prisoner of war. She worked as a courier for the Resistance and continued nursing in ghetto, becoming an integral part of the rescue efforts following the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The insurgency lasted three weeks, and consisted mostly of Jewish youth, led by a five-person command. One of the commanders, Marek Edelman, was the sole survivor of the leadership. When German troops burned the ghetto, Edelman attempted escape by way of the sewer system. Underground members, disguising themselves as Polish Red Cross workers, carried him out of the ghetto on a stretcher. One of the stretcher-bearers was Margolis. To ensure that no one would investigate too closely, the underground posted a sign on Edelman's body declaring him to have typhus, easily passing armed checkpoints.Before the war ended, Margolis and Edelman returned to Łódź, and were joined, when the war ended, by her mother and brother, John. In mid-1945, Margolis and Edelman married, moved to the house which her family had occupied before the war, and she began her medical studies.\n\nCareer\nCompleting her education, Margolis-Edelman became a pediatrician, working in the Łódź Pediatric Clinic. She specialized in diseases of the kidney and juvenile diabetes, establishing a clinic in Rąbka. She conducted research into these diseases and published her findings. In 1951, Margolis-Edelman had her son Alexander and five years later, gave birth to the couples' daughter, Anna. In the midst of preparing for her habilitation, the 1968 Polish political crisis unleashed a new wave of antisemitism and Margolis-Edelman was not allowed to defend her thesis. She and her children fled to France, but her husband remained in Łódź, providing humanitarian services to anyone in need. Unable to convince the French university to accept her Polish degree, she began her studies all over again and worked in a laboratory analyzing the blood of rats to earn a living.After five years of study, Margolis-Edelman re-earned her ability to practice medicine and became head of the chemistry department where she worked and practicing pediatrics at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. She also worked in the Maternal-Infant Protection Service in Seine-Saint-Denis, as well as serving the communes of Aubervilliers and La Courneuve. In 1978, she began working with Doctors Without Borders, on hospital ships with Vietnamese boat people, work that was later officially recognized by the Vietnamese government. When Bernard Kouchner left the organization, he and Margolis-Edelman co-founded Doctors of the World. She participated in medical missions to such places as Afghanistan, Chad, El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon, and Nicaragua.During the 1981-1983 period of martial law in Poland, Margolis-Edelman supported the pro-democracy opposition. She organized internships abroad for Polish doctors, helped those who could not obtain treatment in Poland, and sent drugs and supplies to Polish hospitals, which were unable to obtain them at the time. She helped found the Franco-Polish association \"SOS Aide aux Malades Polonais\", to assist Poles in obtaining treatment in France. Around the same time, she served as president of the Literary Notebook Association (Wilburys' success and particularly its benefit to Petty and Orbison as artists, Lenny Waronker encouraged American guitarist Ry Cooder to form the band Little Village and record for Warner Bros. The group – comprising Cooder, Keltner, John Hiatt and Nick Lowe – released a self-titled album in 1992. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described the Notting Hillbillies' Missing ... Presumed Having a Good Time as a Traveling Wilburys-type side project for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. Writing in New York magazine in late 1990, Elizabeth Wurtzel cited the Notting Hillbillies' album and the self-titled debut by Hindu Love Gods – a band consisting of Warren Zevon and members of R.E.M. – as examples of a trend whereby, following the Wilburys' Vol. 1, \"more and more albums seem to be the rock-and-roll equivalents of bowling night.\"Writing in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin cites the Wilburys' contemporary skiffle as evidence of Lonnie Donegan's continued influence on popular music long after the early 1960s. In his book Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock & Roll, Patrick Humphries describes the Wilburys as \"a makeshift quintet whose roots were firmly and joyously planted in low-key, low-tech skiffle music\". He credits the band with inspiring a brief revival of Donegan's \"DIY skiffle\", which included Knopfler's Notting Hillbillies. Each member of the Traveling Wilburys has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although the band itself has not been inducted. Orbison and Dylan were inducted as solo artists, Harrison was inducted as a member of the Beatles and, posthumously, as a solo artist, Petty as the leader of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Lynne as a member of the Electric Light Orchestra.\n\nCatalogue reissue and Genesis Publications book\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a 25-minute documentary entitled The True History of the Traveling Wilburys and a collection of music videos. The box set was released in three editions; the standard edition, with both CDs and DVD in a double Digipak package and a 16-page booklet; a \"deluxe\" boxed edition with the CDs and DVD and an extensive 40-page booklet, artist postcards, and photographs; or a \"deluxe\" boxed edition on vinyl. This version omits the DVD, but adds a 12-inch vinyl disc with rare versions of the songs.\nThe release debuted at number 1 in the UK and topped the albums chart in Australia, Ireland and other countries. On the US Billboard 200 it reached number 9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.\nIn November 2009, Genesis Publications, a company with which Harrison had been associated since the late 1970s, announced the release of a limited edition fine-bound book titled The Traveling Wilburys. Compiled by Olivia Harrison, the book includes rare photographs, recording notes, handwritten lyrics, sketches, and first-hand commentary on the band's history, together with a foreword by Lynne. Petty, Lynne, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Orbison, Keltner and Idle were among those who attended the US launch at a Beverly Hills bookshop in March 2010. In an interview to publicise the book, Lynne expressed his sadness at the deaths of Harrison and Orbison, and reflected: \"The Wilburys was such a wonderful band, such a marvellous thing to be part of. They were the best people I could ever wish to work with. Every day was like, 'Wow!' ... it was fun from day one.\"\n\nLine-ups\nMusicians\nVolume 1\"Nelson Wilbury\" – George Harrison\n\"Otis Wilbury\" – Jeff Lynne\n\"Lefty Wilbury\" – Roy Orbison\n\"Charlie T. Wilbury, Jr.\" – Tom Petty\n\"Lucky Wilbury\" – Bob DylanVolume 3\"Spike Wilbury\" – George Harrison\n\"Clayton Wilbury\" – Jeff Lynne\n\"Muddy Wilbury\" – Tom Petty\n\"Boo Wilbury\" – Bob DylanJim Keltner, the session drummer and percussionist, was not officially listed as a Wilbury on either album, but was given the nickname \"Buster Sidebury\". Overdubs on the 2007 bonus tracks \"Maxine\" and \"Like a Ship\" were credited to \"Ayrton Wilbury\", a pseudonym for Dhani Harrison. The name Ayrton was used in honour of F1 driver Ayrton Senna. Jim Horn and Ray Cooper played saxophones and percussion, respectively, on both albums. The lead guitar part on the Vol. 3 track \"She's My Baby\" was played by rock guitarist Gary Moore, who received the credit \"Ken Wilbury\".\n\nFurther Wilbury appellation\nHarrison appeared as Nelson Wilbury on Warner Bros. Records' Christmas 1988 promotional album Winter Warnerland (which also included Paul Reubens as \"Pee Wee Wilbury\"). In 1992, in his capacity as producer, Harrison credited himself as \"Spike and Nelson Wilbury\" on his live album Live in Japan. During that Japanese tour, in December 1991, Harrison credited himself as Nakihama Wilbury. The Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1992 single \"Christmas All Over Again\" contained a greeting that read \"Merry Christmas from Nelson and Pee Wee Wilbury\". Additionally, at Tom Petty Celebration in 2019, Roy Orbison Jr. was dubbed \"Lefty Wilbury Jr.\" and Alex Orbison as \"Ginger Wilbury\". The Harrison-made film promoting the Traveling Wilburys, Whatever Wilbury Wilbury, lists the following credits: \"Cecil Bidet Wilbury\" (directed by), \"Lenny W. Wilbury\" (sound), \"Chopper Wilbury\" (editor), \"Edison Wilbury\" (lighting), \"Evelyn Wilbury\" (wardrobe), \"Clyde B. Wilbury\" (special effects), \"Big Mac Wilbury\" (catering), \"Zsa Zsa Wilbury\" (make-up) and \"Tell M. Wilbury\" (production manager).

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWhatever Happened, Happened\n\"Whatever Happened, Happened\" is the 11th television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost. The 97th episode of the show overall, \"Whatever Happened, Happened\" aired April 1, 2009, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers/show runners Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse and directed by \"The Man Behind the Curtain\" director Bobby Roth.In 1977, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) goes to extreme measures to save young Benjamin Linus (Sterling Beaumon) when Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) refuses to help. In flashbacks, Kate takes care of Sawyer's (Josh Holloway) favor and begins to tell the truth to protect Aaron (William Blanchette).\n\nPlot\nFlashbacks\nShortly after the Oceanic six's rescue, Kate Austen and a baby Aaron visit Cassidy, who is an ex-girlfriend of James \"Sawyer\" Ford. Kate gives Cassidy and Sawyer's daughter Clementine (Olivia Vickery) money from the severance pay from Oceanic. Cassidy deduces that Aaron is not Kate's baby, prompting her to tell her the truth about everything that happened on the island. Cassidy eventually leads Kate to realize that the reason she took Aaron as her own, is because Kate needed him in order to get over her emotional attachment to Sawyer. After the survivors's confrontation with Ben, Kate momentarily loses Aaron in a supermarket. She recovers it from a woman who bears a strong resemblance of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), Aaron's mother. After this, she decides to return to the island with the others who left. She leaves Aaron in the care of Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Aaron's biological grandmother. Kate also tells Carole that she is returning to the island to find Carole's daughter, Claire, and bring her home.\n\n1977\nAfter Sayid shoots a young Ben, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) wakes up and notices the situation. He brings Ben to the barracks so that his injuries can be treated by Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). Juliet is unable to perform the necessary surgery on Ben and sends James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway) to retrieve Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a spinal surgeon. Meanwhile, Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) debate the nature of time travel. Hurley is convinced that they have changed the past, as in Back to the Future, but Miles tells him that these events always happened in the past. Hurley, however, points that an older Ben didn't recognize Sayid when he was tortured in 2004, as the man who shot him as a kid. Jack, knowing what Ben does in the future, refuses to help, saying that \"he already saved him once\". This drives Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to do everything she can to help Ben.\nKate goes to the sick bay where Ben is being treated and donates her blood because she is a universal donor. She strikes up a conversation with Ben's father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is upset that Ben stole his keys and freed Sayid from the jail. Once it becomes clear that Ben will succumb to his injuries without further intervention, Kate decides to take Ben to the Others, the island's native population. Sawyer comes to Kate's aid and they bring Ben to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who warns them that if he treats Ben, he will not remember what has happened and will never be the same again. They agree anyway. Another Other urges Richard to inform \"Ellie\" of his intentions and implies that \"Charles\" will not be pleased if he finds out, but Richard says he doesn't answer to either of them. Richard then carries Ben into the temple.\n\n2007\nAfter being knocked out unconscious by Sun, Ben (Michael Emerson) wakes up in the infirmary, and is greeted by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who welcomes him back to \"the land of the living\".\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nSNICK\nSNICK (short for Saturday Night Nickelodeon) was a two-hour programming block on the American cable television network Nickelodeon, geared toward older (preteen to teen) audiences, that ran from August 15, 1992 until January 29, 2005. It was aired on Saturdays starting at 8 p.m and ending at 10 p.m. ET. In 2005, SNICK was revamped as the Saturday night edition of TEENick. Nickelodeon continues to run a Saturday night programming block today, though since the TEENick name was removed from the lineup in February 2009, the block no longer goes by any name.\nThe block debuted on Saturday, August 15, 1992, with a pair of Sunday favorites (the teen sitcom Clarissa Explains It All and The Ren & Stimpy Show) and the network premieres of Roundhouse (a musical comedy variety series) and Are You Afraid of the Dark? (a horror fantasy-drama anthology series).\n\nBackground\nAt the time of SNICK's creation, traditional networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS didn't like to program for younger viewers on Saturday nights. The consensus at the time was that viewers who were 50 years of age and older, were the only ones available, since younger viewers traditionally went out on Saturday nights. This would explain why shows such as NBC's The Golden Girls and Empty Nest were the most predominant shows on Saturday nights at the time. Previously on Saturdays, Nickelodeon themselves ceded the 8 p.m. timeslot to the vintage sitcoms of the channel's late night programming block, Nick at Nite.Then-Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne wanted to expose the myth that there is no audience for kids and teen programming on Saturday nights. Laybourne on that end, was a purveyor of market niche-talk, which was a strategy of programming highly focused programs targeted to specific groups defined by age, gender, race, education, religion or any of a number of other factors. In theory, the audience who would most likely watch SNICK would be too young to be out on the town and subsequently too old to be in bed by eight.Laybourne believed that the original shows on the SNICK block would double Nickelodeon's audience on Saturday night by as many as 650,000 to one million viewers. According to Nickelodeon, about one-third of The Ren & Stimpy Show's audience, more than a million viewers, were between the ages of 18 and 35. By early 1993, Nickelodeon according to A.C. Nielsen ratings, was the number one network among viewers ages 6–11 on Saturday nights. With a 6.il was split into The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Evil Con Carne; they were the last original series to officially carry the Cartoon Cartoon branding before it was discontinued.\nThe Cartoon Cartoons were intended to appeal to a wider audience than the average Saturday-morning cartoon. Linda Simensky, vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that the cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article on them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"bawdy\" than their counterparts at Comedy Central and less \"socially responsible\" than their counterparts at Nickelodeon. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output which each individual series managed.In October 2003, the live-action Fridays premiered on the network as a replacement for Cartoon Cartoon Fridays. The Cartoon Cartoons bumpers (that appeared before and after episodes of its original series) were dropped after the network's CN City rebrand in June 2004. In August 2004, the block Cartoon Cartoons: The Top 5 was renamed to simply The Top 5. CN still kept the Cartoon Cartoons name around in various forms applying to their older series (such as for The Cartoon Cartoon Show from 2005 to 2008), but since newer shows such as Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Camp Lazlo, and Ben 10 were stylistically different from previous shows, the moniker was not applied to them.\nHowever, internationally in places like Asia and Latin America, the moniker continued on until 2007 with shows like Foster's Home, Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, Camp Lazlo, and My Gym Partner's a Monkey.\n\nRevival\nOn April 15, 2021, Cartoon Network announced a new iteration of the Cartoon Cartoons shorts program. On November 24, 2021, the first new Cartoon Cartoons shorts completed production. The first nine shorts include Accordions Geoffery & Mary Melodica by Louie Zong (of The Ghost and Molly McGee and We Bare Bears), Dang! It's Dracula by Levon Jihanian (of Tig n' Seek), Hungy Ghost by Jesse Moynihan (of Adventure Time), Fruit Stand at the End of the World by Rachel Liu, Off the Menu by Shavonne Cherry (of Ren & Stimpy and The Looney Tunes Show), Harmony in Despair by Andrew Dickman (of Looney Tunes Cartoons), Unravel by Alexis Sugden, Mouthwash Madness by Lisa Vandenberg (of Animaniacs), and Scaredy Cat by JJ Villard (of King Star King). On June 7, 2022, More Cartoon Cartoons completed production. The next seven shorts include The All-Nimal by Nick Edwards (of Apple and Onion and The Fungies), Buttons' Gamezone by Fernando Puig (of The Cuphead Show and Tig n' Seek), Tib Tub, We Need You by Sean Godsey and Mike Rosenthal, I Love You Jocelyn by Tracey Laguerre (Art and Animation Director for brands like Google, Dreamworks, Buzzfeed and more) , Pig in a Wig by Sam Marin (of Regular Show), The Good Boy Report (based on the webcomic of the same name) by Kasey Williams (of Niko and the Sword of Light and Harley Quinn) and Maude Macher and Dom Duck by Kali Fontecchio (of The Looney Tunes Show and Jellystone!).\n\nProgramming blocks\nMore shows premiered bearing the Cartoon Cartoons brand, airing throughout the network's schedule and prominently on Cartoon Cartoon Fridays, which became the marquee night for premieres of new episodes and shows beginning June 11, 1999. On June 9, 2000, the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays block began to be hosted each week by a different character from a Cartoon Cartoon series, with the first host being Eustace from Courage the Cowardly Dog. The June 9 broadcast also began the first week of The Big Pick, a showcase of cartoon pilots that could become full series based on the results of an online viewer poll. A similar event, The Big Pick II, aired the following year. On October 3, 2003, following a months-long switch to Summer Fridays and Fridays, the block was rebooted under a hybrid live-action format as Fridays, hosted by Tommy Snider and Nzinga Blake, the latter of whom was later replaced by Tara Sands. It aired shows outside the Cartoon Cartoon moniker, such as Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, Camp Lazlo, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Squirrel Boy, and Class of 3000. The last airing of Fridays was on February 23, 2007.\nCartoon Cartoons: The Top 5 (simply retitled The Top 5 in 2004), an hour-long program featuring a countdown of the week's five \"best\" Cartoon Cartoon episodes from the network's lineup, ran from 2002 to 2008. From 2005 to 2008, the Cartoon Cartoons label was primarily used for The Cartoon Cartoon Show, a half-hour program featuring episodes of older Cartoon Cartoons that were no longer shown regularly on the network.\nThe block Cartoon Planet was revived on Cartoon Network from 2012 to 2014, airing in a format similar to The Cartoon Cartoon Show. It featured Cartoon Cartoons such as Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, The Powerpuff Girls, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, and other original Cartoon Network Studios series such as Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Camp Lazlo, and Chowder.\n\nList of series\nPrecursor\nFull series\n(+) Indicates that the show originally aired as part of Grim & Evil, and that the 2003-2004 episodes were not produced for the standalone show.\n\nIn other media\nDC Comics ran an anthology comic based on the Cartoon Cartoons; the series ran from March 2001 to October 2004 for a total of 33 issues.\nIn the OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes episode \"Crossover Nexus\", the Cartoon Cartoon logo is shown in the bottom of a wall inside the Cartoon Network headquarters; the Cartoon Cartoon jingle theme song is played when Ben Tennyson (Ben 10) shape-shifts into different Cartoon Network characters.\n\nSee also\nList of programs broadcast by Cartoon Network\nNicktoons\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The extensions were constructed by McNamara Constructions Pty Limited.\n\nBlacktown City Libraries\nIn 1947, Blacktown Shire Council formally adopted the Act 1939/ {{{4}}} (NSW), which had been passed to encourage (including financial subsidies) local governments to establish free public libraries, but no further action was taken due to a lack of finance. However it was not until the 1960s, with the significant growth in the area's population, the Council identified a clear need for a library service, and when the Civic Centre opened in 1965, council appointed the first Chief Librarian in 1966 and resolved to establish the first library in the old 1939 Council Chambers building on the opposite side of Flushcombe Road. The first Blacktown Municipal Library was officially opened on 10 April 1967.The Blacktown City Libraries service expanded with the opening of Library Branches at Lalor Park (1968), Mount Druitt (1977) and Riverstone (1978). In 1979, Blacktown council commissioned a new Blacktown branch library, with the old library and 1939 Council Chambers building demolished and replaced by a new building designed by architects Allen Jack & Cottier, and constructed by R. W. Tims (Builders) Pty Ltd. On 31 October 1979, Council resolved to name this new library after the Town Clerk of Blacktown, Max Webber, and the Max Webber Library was officially opened by the Deputy Premier Jack Ferguson on 8 March 1980. A new branch library in Stanhope Gardens was officially opened on 7 August 2009, and was also named after a former Town Clerk as the Dennis Johnson Branch Library.\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2016 census, there were 336,962 people resident in the Blacktown local government area, of these 49.7 per cent were male and 50.3 per cent were female.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLower South Bay, New York\nLower South Bay, commonly called South Bay, is a hamlet on the southwest corner of Oneida Lake, Oneida County, New York, United States. It is opposite North Bay, and is surrounded by many islands to the west, north and east, including Geersbeck Island, Hall Island, Glosky Island, Schroeppel Island, Denmans Island and Long Island (not to be confused with Long Island, New York City). Lower South Bay also lies near the town of Cicero, approximately two miles west.\nPassage 2:\nJones Beach Island\nJones Beach Island is one of the outer barrier islands off the southern coast of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York.\n\nEtymology\nIt is named for Major Thomas Jones, who first came to Long Island in 1692, where he proceeded to build the island's first brick house near Massapequa. Jones built a whaling station on Jones Island near the present site of Jones Beach State Park in 1700.Jones Beach Island is sometimes referred to as Oak Beach Island and is the former home of the infamous Oak Beach Inn.  Because of the ephemeral nature of the various inlets, the name Fire Island is sometimes used to refer collectively to the various barrier islands off the south shore of Long Island, but usually refers specifically to the island across the Fire Island Inlet to the east.\n\nGeography\nJones Beach Island is separated from Long Island by South Oyster Bay and Great South Bay, from Long Beach Barrier Island by Jones Inlet to the west, and from Fire Island by Fire Island Inlet to the east.  It straddles the line between Nassau and Suffolk counties.From west to east, Jones Beach Island contains the following communities and parks:\n\nJones Beach State Park\nJohn F. Kennedy Memorial Wildlife Sanctuary, a Town of Oyster Bay wildlife preserve\nTobay Beach, a Town of Oyster Bay beach\nGilgo, a census-designated place\nWest Gilgo Beach, a private gated community\nGilgo Beach, a community and Town of Babylon beach\nCedar Beach, a Town of Babylon beach\nOverlook Beach, a residents-only Town of Babylon beach\nGilgo State Park, an undeveloped beach\nOak Beach, a census-designated place\nCaptree, a census-designated place\nCaptree State ParkThe southern side of the island is known for its beaches that face the open Atlantic Ocean. The best known of the public beaches on the island, Jones Beach State Park on the western tip of the island, is a summer recreational destination for the New York City area.Jones Beach Island is accessible from Long Island on its western end by the Meadowbrook State Parkway to Merrick (with the Loop Parkway providing a spur to Long Beach), and the Wantagh State Parkway to Wantagh.  The Robert Moses Causeway traverses its eastern end, linking to Babylon via the State Boat Channel Bridge and Great South Bay Bridge, as well as to Fire Island by the Fire Island Inlet Bridge. The Ocean Parkway connects all three causeways and runs the length of the island.\nPassage 3:\nOak Beach–Captree, New York\nOak Beach–Captree, frequently just called Oak Beach, was a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Babylon in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 286 at the 2010 census.Prior to the 2010 census, the area was part of a larger CDP called Gilgo-Oak Beach-Captree, New York. The Oak Beach–Captree CDP consists of some small beach communities on a barrier island along the southern edge of Long Island, including Oak Beach, Oak Island, and Captree Island. As of 2020, Oak Beach–Captree was split into two separate CDPs called Oak Beach and Captree.\n\nGeography\nOak Beach–Captree was located at 40°38′21″N 73°17′35″W.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 3.7 square miles (9.5 km2), of which 2.7 square miles (7.1 km2) is land and 0.93 square miles (2.4 km2), or 25.03%, is water.\n\nDemographics\nThe census numbers are presumably for full-time inhabitants; many of these houses are second homes and not primary residences, although the proportion of seasonal residents is decreasing.\nThe land for these communities is not privately owned, but leased from the Town of Babylon through the year 2065. However, the residences on the property are owned. If the leases are not renewed at some point in the future, the owners will have to move the houses elsewhere, similar to what happened at High Hill Beach when Jones Beach State Park was created.\nPassage 4:\nSouth Oyster Bay\nSouth Oyster Bay or East Bay is a lagoon and natural harbor along the western portion of the south shore of Long Island in New York in the United States. The harbor is formed by Jones Beach Island, a barrier island on the southern side of Long Island. It is approximately 3 mi (5 km) wide between the two islands, and approximately 15 mi (24 km) long. It links to Great South Bay on its eastern end and opens to the Atlantic Ocean through inlets on either side of Jones Beach Island.The name refers to its history as one of the finest oyster beds in the world.\n\nSee also\nOuter Barrier\nJamaica Bay\nOyster Bay, New York\nGreat South Bay\nPatchogue Bay\nSouth Shore Estuary\nPassage 5:\nShort Beach (New York)\nShort Beach is the beach on the northern shore of the western end of Jones Beach Island. The beach faces South Oyster Bay instead of the Atlantic Ocean, thereby providing some shelter from storm waves.  Since 1851 it has been the home of a coastal lifesaving station operated (at first) by the United States Life-Saving Service and later by the United States Coast Guard. The current facility, Station Short Beach, typically does around 500 search and rescue missions each year —one of the busiest units in the Coast Guard's 1st District.  The Jones Beach State Park's West End Boat Basin is also on Short Beach. The Jones Beach West End barracks of the New York State Park Police is around 200 feet south of the Short Beach shoreline. An uninhabited islet, Short Beach Island, is usually just offshore, but occasionally connects to the beach when low tide exposes sandbars to the surface.\n\nExternal links\nUnited States Coast Guard Station Jones Beach\nPassage 6:\nOak Beach Inn\nThe Oak Beach Inn, commonly referred to by the abbreviation OBI, was a Long Island nightclub located in Oak Beach, on Jones Beach Island near Captree State Park in the Town of Babylon, Suffolk County, New York.\n\nHistory and controversy\nIn 1969, Robert Matherson bought what was then a waterfront barrier island restaurant and converted it into an enormously popular (and controversial) nightclub. The Oak Beach Inn, located in Oak Beach on Jones Beach Island, was the original, and later just referred to as The OBI. He later opened three more OBI nightclubs and named them.  There is now a public park at the site. The \"park\" is unusual, in that it lacks any amenities other than a fishing dock and a single portable toilet. While the park encompasses over nine acres of land, there are but two trees and nearly 300 parking spots. In the warmer months the park - or rather the parking lot - collects an informal early Sunday morning motor rally, attracting local motorcycle and car enthusiasts.\n\nGeography\nOak Beach is in southwestern Suffolk County, in the southeast part of the village of Babylon. The census-designated place includes the community of Oak Beach on Jones Beach Island, as well as the community of Oak Island, directly to the north. The CDP is bordered to the east by Captree State Park and to the west by Gilgo State Park. To the south is the west end of Fire Island.\n\nOwnership\nThe land is not owned by the residents but is on long-term lease from the Village of Babylon.  In the early 1990s, New York State litigated against extension of the lease.  After much negotiation, including detailed environmental impact statements, the lease was renewed (currently through 2050), although with a ramp up in costs. In 2012, the Village of Babylon agreed to extend the current leases through 2065.\n\nShannan Gilbert\nOn May 1, 2010,  Shannan Gilbert disappeared after fleeing a client's house in the Oak Beach Association. In December 2010, while searching for Gilbert, the police found 10 dead bodies along the adjacent highway, some bodies in December 2010, others in April 2011. Consequently, the community attracted much public attention.\nIn December 2011, the body of the original missing sex worker Shannan Gilbert was found in the marsh east of the community. On November 29, 2011, the police announced their belief that one person is responsible for all 10 deaths (whom the press refers to at various times as: \"the Long Island serial killer\", \"LISK\", \"the Gilgo Beach Killer\", or \"the Craigslist Ripper\"), and that they did not believe the case of Gilbert, who went missing before the first set of bodies was found, was related. \"It is clear that the area in and around Gilgo Beach has been used to discard human remains for some period of time,\" said Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota.On December 10, 2015, Suffolk County Police announced that the FBI had officially joined the investigation. A spokesperson for the FBI confirmed the announcement. The FBI had previously assisted in the search for victims, but was never officially part of the investigation until this announcement. The investigation is ongoing.\nPassage 10:\nGilgo-Oak Beach-Captree, New York\nGilgo-Oak Beach-Captree, frequently just called Oak Beach, was a census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York within the Town of Babylon. The population was 333 at the 2000 census.\nFollowing the 2010 census, the area was delineated as two CDPs: Gilgo and Oak Beach–Captree. The original CDP contained several small beach communities on a barrier island along the southern edge of Long Island. In order from west to east, these included West Gilgo Beach (on the Nassau/Suffolk county border), Gilgo Beach, Cedar Beach (no residences), Oak Beach (including the Oak Island Beach Association), Oak Island and Captree Island. They are connected to the mainland by Ocean Parkway from the west and Robert Moses State Parkway from the north.\nPrior to the 2020 census, the Oak Beach-Captree CDP was further split into the Oak Beach and Captree CDPs.\n\nGeography\nOak Beach is located at 40°38′28″N 73°16′42″W (40.641100, -73.278195).According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2), of which 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2) was land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2), or 25.21%, is water.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 333 people, 161 households, and 94 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 122.1 inhabitants per square mile (47.1/km2). There were 305 housing units at an average density of 111.9 per square mile (43.2/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.00% White, 0.30% African American and 2.70% Asian. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.80% of the population.\nThere were 161 households, out of which 14.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were married couples living together, 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.0% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.07 and the average family size was 2.64.\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out, with 13.5% under the age of 18, 1.5% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 21.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $66,250, and the median income for a family was $105,870. Males had a median income of $61,250 versus $37,083 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $55,813. None of the families and 0.9% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.\nThe census numbers are presumably for full-time inhabitants; many of these houses are second homes and not primary residences, although the proportion of seasonal residents is decreasing.\nThe land for these communities is not privately owned, but leased from the State of New York through the year 2050.  However, the residences on the property are owned.  If the leases are not renewed at some point in the future, the owners will have to move the houses elsewhere, similar to what happened at High Hill Beach when Jones Beach was created.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The next two episodes focused on the eccentric explorer \"The Great Belzoni\" played here by Matthew Kelly. The final two episodes dramatise the discovery and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone by Jean-François Champollion (Elliot Cowan).\nThe music was recorded by the Warsaw Radio Orchestra and is featured on the CD Timeless Histories by Chappell music, produced by Clare Isaacs.\n\nProduction\nThe series was a major new docudrama series produced by the BBC for the Autumn 2005 schedule.\n\"The whole idea behind the series was to be able to discover Ancient Egypt through the eyes of Howard Carter – famous for uncovering the tomb of Tutankhamun; The Great Belzoni – an amazing adventurer and explorer; and the scholar Jean-François Champollion, who was the first to decipher the Rosetta Stone and open up the meaning of hieroglyphics.\"\nIn order to create a sense of \"seeing the treasures of Ancient Egypt for the first time\", Dolling and Bradshaw felt it essential to film at the actual archaeological sites referenced in the series.\n\n\"We had fantastic help from the Government and a local production crew, they managed to fix it for us to film in areas that, as far as we know, have never been used by other television or film productions.\"\n\"Being the first UK TV company to attempt such a project in the most amazing historical sights was very exhilarating, and to be able to return them - with additional sets and some computer imagery - to how they were during the time of the Pharaohs was incredible.\"\nFilming at such invaluable and popular sites created new challenges for the film makers.\n\n\"Keeping people out of shot was one — sometimes this was nearing impossible — but we tended to shoot early in the day so disruptions were kept to a minimum. The other was obviously making sure we didn't damage anything, which thankfully we managed!\"\n\"It was difficult keeping such a unique project running so far from home, and it is a tribute to the cast and crew that we managed to succeed. The series really is great and looks fantastic, well worth all the hard work.\"\nThe co-production between BBC and The Learning Channel was initially budgeted at around £6.5m but problems filming on location in Egypt, including the weather and illness, meant the producers required another £2million. Post production costs involved in recreating Ancient Egypt meant that the final costs could have resulted in a £5million overspend but the BBC denied this.\n\n\"To suggest the overspend is anything in the [range of] £5m is utterly ridiculous — it is simply not true. This was a huge project shot on location in Egypt and, as with any project of such scale, we had contingency funds available to us — so the unavoidable overspend was accommodated for and fully authorised.\"\n\"I think it's useful to point out that the cost per hour of Egypt will still be lower than other comparable programmes such as Pompeii, Genghis Khan and Pyramid. In fact, due to the international co-financing, this is actually incredibly good value for money providing full period drama for the budget normally associated with a documentary.\"\nSeveral multi-media productions were commissioned to tie-in with the series including interactive drama BBC Egypt Interactive, award-winning online-game Death in Sakkara: An Egyptian Adventure, and an interactive exhibition at BBC Birmingham.A companion series Egyptian Journeys with Dan Cruickshank, in which architectural historian Cruickshank travels the country to explore some of the intriguing stories that have emerged from ancient Egypt, was broadcast concurrently on BBC Two.\n\nReception\nReviews\nSam Wollaston writing about episode one in The Guardian said that he \"was expecting to hate this show,\" fearing it would be \"narration interspersed with lame reconstruction,\" but he was pleased to discover it was, in fact, \"a proper drama, with a very decent script and real actors.\" \"And it's a great story, too,\" he states, although he did not enjoy the re-enactments of the life of Tutankhamun, which he described as \"olive-skinned actors with non-speaking parts and an awful lot of eye-liner, wandering around in a semi-darkness lit by flickering candles,\" and claims were not necessary, \"but maybe that will help to sell it to America.\" He concludes that he is \"looking forward to part two.\"David Liddiment writing in The Guardian complimented the cleverly twinning of this docudrama with the more cerebral Egyptian Journeys with Dan Cruickshank on BBC Two but he points out that this was done during the final stages of the BBC's charter renewal review and insists that the corporation should keep up standards after this process is completed.\n\nRatings\nEpisode one (2005-10-30): 7 million viewers (29% audience share).\nEpisode two (2005-11-06): 6 million viewers (24% audience share).\nEpisode three (2005-11-13): 5.7 million viewers (23% audience share).\nEpisode four (2005-11-20): 4.8 million viewers.\nEpisode five (2005-11-27): 4.5 million viewers (18% audience share).\n\nEpisodes\nPart one: Howard Carter\nThe story of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter and the popular belief in the Curse of the Pharaohs, a supposed result of Carter's disturbing Tutankhamen's resting place. The episodes include short dramatizations of the life of Tutankhamun.\n\nEpisode one: The Search for Tutankhamun\nTutankhamun vanished from history in 1324 BC following his hurried burial and the erasure of his name from all monuments. In the winter of 1898 Carter is at the temples of Deir el Bahri recording wall reliefs threatened by a freak storm when he is thrown from his horse and makes a discovery in the sand. Retired Boston lawyer Theodore M. Davis funds Carter's excavation of Queen Hatshepsut's tomb but it is found to be empty and Carter deprived of further funding is reduced to selling his paintings to tourists on the street.\nIn 1905 Lord Carnarvon arrives in Luxor to convalesce after a road accident and is shown an artifact bearing the cartouche of the mysterious Tutankhamun discovered by Davis on his new dig. Tutankhamun succeeded his heretical father as pharaoh at the age of 8 and was named in honour of Amun to symbolise his mission to restore the old gods and save the empire from turmoil. An inspired Carnarvon employs Carter but they are denied access to the Valley of the Kings for which only Davis haswill appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, exposing her anus to create more publicity. Seeing Randy as an obstacle to this plan, the producer's henchmen attempt to restrain Randy, who escapes. When Randy informs his wife Sharon of the plan, she is incredulous that she slept with a hologram, which is revealed to be Tupac. Meanwhile, Randy's producer conspires with Cartman to install him as the leader in an upcoming social media revolution involving holograms.\n\nProduction\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone said on the DVD audio commentary that this episode was originally two separate episodes, one about PewDiePie and one about Lorde. This plan did not materialize because they couldn't figure out an ending that would be long enough to fill up the time for either show. To rectify this, they intended to put them together to make one episode. However, this didn't work either because Parker had written a lot of good material and now felt it needed to be a three-part story arc episode. They considered actually doing this but expected problems with Comedy Central. After shifting back and forth between one episode and three episodes, they finally settled on two partway through the production cycle. In hindsight, they thought it would have been better off if they made it a three-part story.The scene in which Randy/Lorde is at the concert and gets into a fight with Iggy Azalea was originally going to be used as the final scene for \"The Cissy\", the third episode of this season. This idea was scrapped with the intention to use it later; it was used in this episode, but with a few modifications. Sia was originally present but was at some point removed and Randy was going to get in a fight with everyone else, not just one person.The PewDiePie story originated from Parker having similar experiences to Kyle that he had with his step-son. Another influence of the story was the fact that Parker and Stone felt that more people experienced South Park: The Stick of Truth, their video game, through PewDiePie than by actually buying and playing the game themselves. They thought it would be fun to \"rip\" on this.Parker and Stone said that making this episode, and the second part, made them feel old, mainly because the episodes deal with newer things that young people are interested in, such as new technology, pop music, and the focus on Internet. This is also where the title came from; things like Twitter, YouTube Let's Play, and the Internet in general, sometimes feel like places where all people do is \"rehash each other's shit\", an opinion that is shared by several characters in the episode.\n\nReception\nThe episode received a B+ rating from The A.V. Club's Eric Thurn, who commented \"at first this seemed like a pretty good, if also a bit scatter-brained episode of South Park\", but praised the continuity shown in both this episode and the entire season.Max Nicholson from IGN gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, stating \"in terms of sheer meta-ness, this week's #Rehash was off the charts.\"Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 2.5 out of 5 stars and called it \"an episode that throws a lot of fun ideas at us with nothing to balance them out.\"\nPassage 10:\nSouth Park (season 2)\nThe second season of South Park, an American animated television series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, began airing on April 1, 1998. The second season concluded after 18 episodes on January 20, 1999; it remains the longest season of South Park to date. Almost all the episodes were directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, with the exception of two episodes directed by Eric Stough.\n\nBroadcast\nThe first season of the show concluded with the episode \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on February 25, 1998, and had a cliffhanger ending regarding the identity of Cartman's father. The episode scheduled for April 1, 1998 promised to resolve the mystery, but was in fact an April Fools' Day joke on the creator's part: \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", an entire episode revolving around the two title characters. The April 1 episode was supposed to be a one-off, with the rest of the season starting in May. However, following overwhelmingly negative fan reaction, the episode resolving the Cartman's father storyline, \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\", was moved from its planned May 20 air date to April 22. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" then started a six-episode weekly run of the season when it was broadcast on May 20.The show went on a summer break of a month and a half, and returned for another six-episode run on August 19, with the episode \"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\". The next installment came after a three-week break, with the Halloween episode \"Spookyfish\", which aired on October 28. The next two episodes were \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\" and \"Gnomes\", airing on December 9 and 16 respectively. The final episode of the season, \"Prehistoric Ice Man\" aired after five weeks of hiatus, on January 20, 1999. The third season then started a few months later, in April 1999.\n\nVoice cast\nMain cast\nTrey Parker as Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Randy Marsh, Mr. Garrison, Clyde Donovan, Mr. Hankey, Mr. Mackey, Tolkien Black, and Phillip\nMatt Stone as Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, Butters Stotch, Gerald Broflovski, Stuart McCormick, Pip Pirrup, Craig Tucker, Jimbo Kern, Terrance, Tweek Tweak and Jesus\nMary Kay Bergman as Liane Cartman, Sheila Broflovski, Shelly Marsh, Sharon Marsh, Mrs. McCormick and Wendy Testaburger\nIsaac Hayes as Chef\n\nGuest cast\nHenry Winkler as the Kid-Eating Monster (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nJay Leno as himself (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nBrent Musburger as Scuzzlebutt's leg (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nJonathan Katz as Dr. Katz (\"Summer Sucks\")\nDian Bachar as the Cow Days' announcer (\"Cow Days\")Multiple musicians and bands made guest appearances in the episode \"Chef Aid\".

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJohn Franks (judge)\nSir John Franks (1770–1852), was an Indian judge.\nFranks was the second son of Thomas Franks (1729–1787), of Ballymagooly, County Cork, by Catherine, daughter of Rev. John Day. He was born in 1770, and graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, B.A. 1788, LL.B. 1791. He was called to the Irish Bar 1792. He went on the Munster circuit, and had a good practice as chamber counsel. He became King's Counsel in 1823. In 1825 the Board of Control, on the recommendation of his friend William Plunket, then Attorney General for Ireland, appointed him a judge of the Supreme Court at Calcutta. He received, as was customary, the honour of knighthood before his departure for India. He held this office until the effect of the climate on his health brought about his resignation in 1834. On his return, he resided at Roebuck, near Dublin. He died on 11 January 1852. He married three times. By his first wife, Catherine, daughter of his cousin Thomas Franks of Carrig, Cork, he had two sons and three daughters. His second marriage was to Jane Marshall, and his third to Sarah O'Regan. His eldest son and heir was John Franks of Ballyscaddan, County Limerick; his younger son, Matthew, was an army officer, as were many of his later descendants.\nFranks was popular, both as advocate and judge. He was an intimate friend of John Philpot Curran, and one of his executors.  W. H. Curran, J.P. Curran's son, commemorates his ‘peculiar aboriginal wit, quiet, keen, and natural to the occasion, and, best of all, never malignant’.\n\nArms\nPassage 2:\nHenry Archer\nHenry Archer (1799 – 2 March 1863) was the son of an Irish landowner. He attended Trinity College, Dublin. He was called to the Irish Bar and spent most of his time between North Wales and London.\n\nFfestiniog Railway\nIn railway circles, Archer is known mostly for the Ffestiniog Railway, which was the major work of his life, a fiery temper, a large frame and an even larger personality. A few recall his long running but fruitless championship of the various Porth Dinllaen railway and harbour projects.\nThe Ffestiniog slate industry should be grateful to Henry Archer for being in the right place at the right time. It was at the Penygroes Inn in 1829 that Archer met Samuel Holland Jnr., of Rhiwbryfdir slate mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog who was returning from Caernarfon where he banked with Williams and Co. He had travelled between Caernarfon and Penygroes as a passenger on the horse drawn Nantlle Tramway and had called at the Inn for a cup of tea before collecting his horse and riding home.\nIn conversation, Archer expressed an interest in the Nantlle Railway that was apparently quietly seeking a purchaser. Holland, it is said, suggested that Archer should leave Nantlle to its fate and turn his energies to building a proper railway from Ffestiniog to Porthmadog. A detailed discussion followed and Archer became involved with Holland in the promotion of the Ffestiniog Railway Company.\nIt was left to Archer as the Managing Director designate to raise the initial capital of £24,185 largely on the Dublin Stock Exchange (including £11,905 of his own money). He was the driving force also in steering the bill through Parliament and in managing the company during construction and through its early years when Archer had to persuade a suspicious slate industry to entrust its slate transport to a railway. Archer quarrelled with his fellow directors, with the Oakeley Estate and with James Spooner and was less active in FR company affairs after the railway opened. In 1836 he sued the FR company for his salary and received a substantial settlement. Nominally he remained as Managing Director until 1856 and as a director until 1860, when the FR Co. gave him a pension of £100 per annum as the originator of the FR and for devoting many years to its service.\n\nPhilately\nPhilatelists know Henry Archer as the inventor of the first postage stamp perforating machine, which he patented in 1848, to facilitate stamp separation. Following the successful Prince Consort Essay trials in 1853, he sold his copyright and patents to the Postmaster General for £4,000. In early trials, his alternative Archer Roulette machines failed to work well.\nArcher died at Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France on 2 March 1863.\nPassage 3:\nFenmore Baldwin\nFenmore Baldwin is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network. Created by former head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden as the son of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman), the character was born during the episode airing on October 13, 2006. Initially portrayed by various child actors, including Robbie Tucker, the character was rapidly aged to a teenager in 2012, with Max Ehrich assuming the role through 2015. In 2018, the role was recast with Zach Tinker.\nAs a teenager, the character's storylines have included a romance with Summer Newman (Hunter King), as well as a cyberbullying plot with Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo), which was generally well received by the actors and public. Fenmore has also developed a \"dark side\", coinciding with teenage angst. Ehrich characterized the character as being at a \"vulnerable age\", while \"trying to find his place in the world\". Ehrich's portrayal has received a positive response; Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described the actor as talented, as well as Luke Kerr of Zap2it praising Ehrich for \"mastering the crazy behind-the-eyes element\" of the character's relatives. Ehrich's portrayal garnered him four consecutive Daytime Emmy Award nominations between 2013 and 2016.\n\nCasting\nThe role was first portrayed by three sets of twins, including Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales over the course of 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a \"long audition process\", saying: \"I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone,step right into Sunny after that.\"On October 2, 2017, the show premiered on Vice on TV.The series is available for streaming on Hulu except for the episodes \"America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest\", \"Dee Reynolds: Shaping America's Youth\", \"The Gang Recycles Their Trash\", \"The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 6\" and \"Dee Day\", due to scenes involving blackface. The same episodes are missing from Netflix in the UK, Disney+ in Australia, Canada, and Scandinavia, and Star+ in Latin America.\n\nMusic\nThe show uses recurring orchestral production music selections. \"We had a music supervisor called Ray Espinola and we said, 'Give us everything you have in a sort of Leave It to Beaver with a big band-swing kind of feel,' and the majority of the songs are from what he sent over,\" Charlie Day explained. \"When you set it against what these characters were doing—which often times can be perceived as quite despicable, or wrong—it really disarmed the audience. It just became our go-to library of songs.\"The theme song is called \"Temptation Sensation\" by German composer Heinz Kiessling. Kiessling's work (\"On Your Bike\" and \"Blue Blood\") can also be heard during various scene transitions throughout the show, along with other composers and pieces such as Werner Tautz (\"Off Broadway\"), Joe Brook (\"Moonbeam Kiss\"), and Karl Grell (\"Honey Bunch\"). Many of the tracks heard in the series are from Cafe Romantique, an album of easy listening production music collected by Extreme Music, the production music library unit of Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Independent record label Fervor Records has also contributed music to the show. Songs from The Jack Gray Orchestra's album Easy Listening Symph-O-Nette (\"Take A Letter Miss Jones,\" \"Golly Gee Whiz,\" and \"Not a Care in the World\") and the John Costello III release Giants of Jazz (\"Birdcage,\" \"Cotton Club\" and \"Quintessential\") are heard in several episodes.\nThe soundtrack, featuring most of the music heard on the show, was released in 2010.\n\nSoundtrack track listing\nReception and legacy\nCritical reviews and commentary\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has received critical acclaim for its humor and the performances of the cast. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it \"not merely the best sitcom on television but one of the most arresting and ambitious current TV series, period.\" Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first season negatively, commenting, \"[I]t is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn't.\" Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a positive review, saying it was \"invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, all while lampooning taboo topics.\" However, later seasons of the show have received favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70/100, 78/100 and 85/100 for seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is often compared in style to Seinfeld—particularly due to the self-centered nature of its main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote, \"It's like Seinfeld on crack,\" a quote that became widely used to describe the series, to the point that FX attached the tagline, \"It's Seinfeld on crack.\"In 2014, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at number 7 in the \"26 Best Cult TV Shows Ever,\" with the comment that \"it's a great underdog story ... If it sounds too dark for you, consider that there's an episode about making mittens for kittens, and it's adorable.\" In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook likes found that Sunny was \"more popular in college towns (and most popular in Philadelphia).\"In 2015, Rolling Stone rated the top 20 greatest and funniest It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes, stating \"for 10 seasons, the series had mined comic gold from the execrable behavior of the owners of Paddy's Pub.\" They claimed the two-part season 4 episode, \"Mac and Charlie Die\" is the sitcom's greatest episode yet. In 2019, the BBC called the show \"the best US sitcom.\" They praised the show's unique outlook and ability to range from nihilistic humor to genuine heartfelt moments.According to Matt Fowler of IGN, the series \"broke new ground\" due to its sociopathic depiction of \"The Gang\". It was also ranked 63rd in IGN's list of the top 100 TV shows of all time.\n\nAwards\nOther media\nThe Nightman Cometh live\nIn September 2009, the cast took their show live. The \"Gang\" performed the musical The Nightman Cometh in New York City, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. Mary Elizabeth Ellis and Artemis Pebdani also appeared in the performance as The Waitress and Artemis. Actress Rhea Perlman (wife of Danny DeVito) assumed the role of Gladys.Creator Rob McElhenney said that Live Nation originally approached the cast about doing the show at 30 cities, but in the end the cast settled on six. Co-developer Glenn Howerton described the show as \"essentially an expanded version of the actual episode of \"The Nightman Cometh,\" which was the final episode for season four. There are some added moments, added scenes, added songs, and extended versions of songs that already existed.\" The performance featured two new songs, and the actors were given more opportunity to improvise thanks to the longer running time. An episode from season five was also previewed before the show.\nThe Los Angeles performance, filmed at The Troubadour, was included as a bonus feature on the season four DVD box set.\n\nRussian adaptation\nA Russian adaptation of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia premiered in Russia on the television channel TNT on May 12, 2014. This version is titled В Москве всегда солнечно (V Moskve vsegda solnechno, It's Always Sunny in Moscow) and like the original, centers around four friends, who own a bar called \"Philadelphia\" in Moscow.\n\nBook\nA book based upon It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was released on January 6, 2015, titled The Gang Writes a Self-Help Book: The 7 Secrets of Awakening the Highly Effective Four-Hour Giant, Today.\n\nPodcast\nOn November 9, 2021, Howerton, Day, and McElhenney started The Always Sunny Podcast, an episode-by-episode-recap of the show, with Megan Ganz as producer. Occasional guest stars include Kaitlin Olson, David Hornsby, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Michael Naughton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Cormac Bluestone and Danny DeVito.\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPatrick Henry High School (Ashland, Virginia)\nPatrick Henry High School is a public high school in Ashland, Virginia in Hanover County. Patrick Henry is one of four high schools in Hanover County, and the only High school in the western half of the county. In 1959, after years of deliberation, Patrick Henry High School began with the consolidation of Beaverdam, Henry Clay, Montpelier, and Rockville high schools. The western Hanover County high school enrolled students in grades eight through twelve. The name of the school, as well as the name of its literary publications, The Voice, The Spark, and The Orator, reference the history of American Founding Father Patrick Henry, Hanover County's most illustrious citizen. Even the school colors of red, white, and blue are a patriotic symbol of history.\nIn 1969, Patrick Henry High and John M. Gandy High School merged to form one integrated student body. Also in 1969, a new junior high school was built, and Patrick Henry opened that school year as a senior high school serving students in grades ten through twelve. When the junior high school was changed to a middle school in 1988, Patrick Henry became a high school, enrolling students in grades nine through twelve. The school campus of West Patrick Henry Road, which consists of a complex of buildings, began as a campus style school. Additions of an auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria, new gymnasium, and renovations to the media center and administrative offices resulted in an all-enclosed facility in 1992. As the population and the needs of the school have changed, so have the dimensions of the school. A new addition/renovation was added to the facility in the fall of 2001, providing state-of-the-art career and technical education opportunities. This addition consisted of a broadcasting studio, a bio-technology lab, a communication technology center, a computer-assisted drafting lab, and three classrooms. Patrick Henry celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2009. Patrick Henry High has an International Baccalaureate program, as well as a NJROTC program.\n\nExtracurricular Activities\nAthletics\nCross Country\nFootball - won the 1994 Virginia high school football state championship\nGolf\nField Hockey\nVolleyball\nThe boys' volleyball program won 7 straight VHSL State titles (2016 5A Championship and 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Class 4 Championships.)

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nShort interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)\nShort interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are non-autonomous, non-coding transposable elements (TEs) that are about 100 to 700 base pairs in length. They are a class of retrotransposons, DNA elements that amplify themselves throughout eukaryotic genomes, often through RNA intermediates. SINEs compose about 13% of the mammalian genome.The internal regions of SINEs originate from tRNA and remain highly conserved, suggesting positive pressure to preserve structure and function of SINEs.  While SINEs are present in many species of vertebrates and invertebrates, SINEs are often lineage specific, making them useful markers of divergent evolution between species. Copy number variation and mutations in the SINE sequence make it possible to construct phylogenies based on differences in SINEs between species. SINEs are also implicated in certain types of genetic disease in humans and other eukaryotes.\nIn essence, short interspersed nuclear elements are genetic parasites which have evolved very early in the history of eukaryotes to utilize protein machinery within the organism as well as to co-opt the machinery from similarly parasitic genomic elements. The simplicity of these elements make them remarkably successful at persisting and amplifying (through retrotransposition)  within the genomes of eukaryotes. These \"parasites\" which have become ubiquitous in genomes can be very deleterious to organisms as discussed below. However, eukaryotes have been able to integrate short-interspersed nuclear elements into different signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathways and SINEs have become a great source of genetic variability. They seem to play a particularly important role in the regulation of gene expression and the creation of RNA genes. This regulation extends to chromatin re-organization and the regulation of genomic architecture. The different lineages, mutations, and activities among eukaryotes make short-interspersed nuclear elements a useful tool in phylogenetic analysis.\n\nClassification and structure\nSINEs are classified as non-LTR retrotransposons because they do not contain long terminal repeats (LTRs). There are three types of SINEs common to vertebrates and invertebrates: CORE-SINEs, V-SINEs, and AmnSINEs. SINEs have 50-500 base pair internal regions which contain a tRNA-derived segment with A and B boxes that serve as an internal promoter for RNA polymerase III.\n\nInternal structure\nSINEs are characterized by their different modules, which are essentially a sectioning of their sequence. SINEs can, but do not necessarily have to possess a head, a body, and a tail. The head, is at the 5' end of short-interspersed nuclear elements and is an evolutionarily derived from an RNA synthesized by RNA Polymerase III such as ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs; the 5' head is indicative of which endogenous element that SINE was derived from and was able to parasitically utilize its transcriptional machinery. For example, the 5' of the Alu sine is derived from 7SL RNA, a sequence transcribed by RNA Polymerase III which codes for the RNA element of SRP, an abundant ribonucleoprotein. The body of SINEs possess an unknown origin but often share much homology with a corresponding LINE which thus allows SINEs to parasitically co-opt endonucleases coded by LINEs (which recognize certain sequence motifs). Lastly, the 3′ tail of SINEs is composed of short simple repeats of varying lengths; these simple repeats are sites where two (or more) short-interspersed nuclear elements can combine to form a dimeric SINE. Short-interspersed nuclear elements which only possess a head and tail are called simple SINEs whereas short-interspersed nuclear elements which also possess a body or are a combination of two or more SINEs are complex SINEs.\n\nTranscription\nShort-interspersed nuclear elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III which is known to transcribe ribosomal RNA and tRNA, two types of RNA vital to ribosomal assembly and mRNA translation. SINEs, like tRNAs and many small-nuclear RNAs possess an internal promoter and thus are transcribed differently than most protein-coding genes.  In other words, short-interspersed nuclear elements have their key promoter elements within the transcribed region itself. Though transcribed by RNA polymerase III, SINEs and other genes possessing internal promoters, recruit different transcriptional machinery and factors than genes possessing upstream promoters.\n\nEffects on gene expression\nChanges in chromosome structure influence gene expression primarily by affecting the accessibility of genes to transcriptional machinery. The chromosome has a very complex and hierarchical system of organizing the genome. This system of organization, which includes histones, methyl groups, acetyl groups, and a variety of proteins and RNAs allows different domains within a chromosome to be accessible to polymerases, transcription factors, and other associated proteins to different degrees.  Furthermore, the shape and density of certain areas of a chromosome can affect the shape and density of neighboring (or even distant regions) on the chromosome through interaction facilitated by different proteins and elements. Non-coding RNAs  such as short-interspersed nuclear elements, which have been known to associate with and contribute to chromatin structure, can thus play huge role in regulating gene expression.  Short-interspersed-nuclear-elements similarly can be involved in gene regulation by modifying genomic architecture.\nIn fact Usmanova et al. 2008 suggested that short-interspersed nuclear elements can serve as direct signals in chromatin rearrangement and structure.  The paper examined the global distribution of SINEs in mouse and human chromosomes and determined that this distribution was very similar to genomic distributions of genes and CpG motifs. The distribution of SINEs to genes was significantly more similar than that of other non-coding genetic elements and even differed significantly from the distribution of long-interspersed nuclear elements. This suggested that the SINE distribution was not a mere accident caused by LINE-mediated retrotransposition but rather that SINEs possessed a role in gene-regulation. Furthermore, SINEs frequently contain motifs for YY1 polycomb proteins. YY1 is a zinc-finger protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor for a wide-variety of genes essential for development and signaling.  Polycomb protein YY1 is believed to mediate the activity of histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases to facilitate chromatin re-organization; this is often to facilitate the formation of heterochromatin (gene-silencing state). Thus, the analysis suggests that short-interspersed nuclear elements can function as a ‘signal-booster' in the polycomb-dependent silencing of gene-sets through chromatin re-organization.  In essence, it is the cumulative effect of many types of interactions that leads to the difference between et) on the mRNA to append an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This is done for each triplet on the mRNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single mRNA, forming what is called a polyribosome or polysome.\n\nCotranslational folding\nThe ribosome is known to actively participate in the protein folding. The structures obtained in this way are usually identical to the ones obtained during protein chemical refolding; however, the pathways leading to the final product may be different. In some cases, the ribosome is crucial in obtaining the functional protein form. For example, one of the possible mechanisms of folding of the deeply knotted proteins relies on the ribosome pushing the chain through the attached loop.\n\nAddition of translation-independent amino acids\nPresence of a ribosome quality control protein Rqc2 is associated with mRNA-independent protein elongation. This elongation is a result of ribosomal addition (via tRNAs brought by Rqc2) of CAT tails: ribosomes extend the C-terminus of a stalled protein with random, translation-independent sequences of alanines and threonines.\n\nRibosome locations\nRibosomes are classified as being either \"free\" or \"membrane-bound\".\n\nFree and membrane-bound ribosomes differ only in their spatial distribution; they are identical in structure. Whether the ribosome exists in a free or membrane-bound state depends on the presence of an ER-targeting signal sequence on the protein being synthesized, so an individual ribosome might be membrane-bound when it is making one protein, but free in the cytosol when it makes another protein.\nRibosomes are sometimes referred to as organelles, but the use of the term organelle is often restricted to describing sub-cellular components that include a phospholipid membrane, which ribosomes, being entirely particulate, do not. For this reason, ribosomes may sometimes be described as \"non-membranous organelles\".\n\nFree ribosomes\nFree ribosomes can move about anywhere in the cytosol, but are excluded from the cell nucleus and other organelles. Proteins that are formed from free ribosomes are released into the cytosol and used within the cell. Since the cytosol contains high concentrations of glutathione and is, therefore, a reducing environment, proteins containing disulfide bonds, which are formed from oxidized cysteine residues, cannot be produced within it.\n\nMembrane-bound ribosomes\nWhen a ribosome begins to synthesize proteins that are needed in some organelles, the ribosome making this protein can become \"membrane-bound\". In eukaryotic cells this happens in a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the \"rough ER\". The newly produced polypeptide chains are inserted directly into the ER by the ribosome undertaking vectorial synthesis and are then transported to their destinations, through the secretory pathway. Bound ribosomes usually produce proteins that are used within the plasma membrane or are expelled from the cell via exocytosis.\n\nBiogenesis\nIn bacterial cells, ribosomes are synthesized in the cytoplasm through the transcription of multiple ribosome gene operons. In eukaryotes, the process takes place both in the cell cytoplasm and in the nucleolus, which is a region within the cell nucleus. The assembly process involves the coordinated function of over 200 proteins in the synthesis and processing of the four rRNAs, as well as assembly of those rRNAs with the ribosomal proteins.\n\nOrigin\nThe ribosome may have first originated as a protoribosome, possibly containing a peptidyl transferase centre (PTC), in an RNA world, appearing as a self-replicating complex that only later evolved the ability to synthesize proteins when amino acids began to appear. Studies suggest that ancient ribosomes constructed solely of rRNA could have developed the ability to synthesize peptide bonds. In addition, evidence strongly points to ancient ribosomes as self-replicating complexes, where the rRNA in the ribosomes had informational, structural, and catalytic purposes because it could have coded for tRNAs and proteins needed for ribosomal self-replication. Hypothetical cellular organisms with self-replicating RNA but without DNA are called ribocytes (or ribocells).As amino acids gradually appeared in the RNA world under prebiotic conditions, their interactions with catalytic RNA would increase both the range and efficiency of function of catalytic RNA molecules. Thus, the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome from an ancient self-replicating machine into its current form as a translational machine may have been the selective pressure to incorporate proteins into the ribosome's self-replicating mechanisms, so as to increase its capacity for self-replication.\n\nHeterogeneous ribosomes\nRibosomes are compositionally heterogeneous between species and even within the same cell, as evidenced by the existence of cytoplasmic and mitochondria ribosomes within the same eukaryotic cells. Certain researchers have suggested that heterogeneity in the composition of ribosomal proteins in mammals is important for gene regulation, i.e., the specialized ribosome hypothesis. However, this hypothesis is controversial and the topic of ongoing research.Heterogeneity in ribosome composition was first proposed to be involved in translational control of protein synthesis by Vince Mauro and Gerald Edelman. They proposed the ribosome filter hypothesis to explain the regulatory functions of ribosomes. Evidence has suggested that specialized ribosomes specific to different cell populations may affect how genes are translated. Some ribosomal proteins exchange from the assembled complex with cytosolic copies suggesting that the structure of the in vivo ribosome can be modified without synthesizing an entire new ribosome.\nCertain ribosomal proteins are absolutely critical for cellular life while others are not. In budding yeast, 14/78 ribosomal proteins are non-essential for growth, while in humans this depends on the cell of study. Other forms of heterogeneity include post-translational modifications to ribosomal proteins such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Arabidopsis, Viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) may mediate translations by compositionally distinct ribosomes. For example, 40S ribosomal units without eS25 in yeast and mammalian cells are unable to recruit the CrPV IGR IRES.Heterogeneity of ribosomal RNA modifications plays a significant role in structural maintenance and/or function and most mRNA modifications are found in highly conserved regions. The most common rRNA modifications are pseudouridylation and 2’-O methylation of ribose.\n\nSee also\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAnacardiaceae\nThe Anacardiaceae, commonly known as the cashew family or sumac family, are a family of flowering plants, including about 83 genera with about 860 known species. Members of the Anacardiaceae bear fruits that are drupes and in some cases produce urushiol, an irritant. The Anacardiaceae include numerous genera, several of which are economically important, notably cashew (in the type genus Anacardium), mango, Chinese lacquer tree,  yellow mombin, Peruvian pepper, poison ivy, poison oak, sumac, smoke tree, marula and cuachalalate.  The genus Pistacia (which includes the pistachio and mastic tree) is now included, but was previously placed in its own family, the Pistaciaceae.\n\nDescription\nTrees or shrubs, each has inconspicuous flowers and resinous or milky sap that may be highly poisonous, as in black poisonwood and sometimes foul-smelling.Resin canals located in the inner fibrous bark of the fibrovascular system found in the plant's stems, roots, and leaves are characteristic of all members of this family; resin canals located in the pith are characteristic of many of the cashew family species and several species have them located in the primary cortex or the regular bark.  Tannin sacs are also widespread among the family.The wood of the Anacardiaceae has the frequent occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally in some species side by side with scalariform holes (in Campnosperma, Micronychia, and Heeria argentea (Anaphrenium argenteum).  The simple pits are located along the vessel wall and in contact with the parenchyma.Leaves are deciduous or evergreen, usually alternate (rarely opposite), estipulate (without stipule) and imparipinnate (rarely paripinnate or bipinnate), usually with opposite leaflets (rarely alternate), while others are trifoliolate or simple or unifoliolate (very rarely simple leaves are palmate). Leaf architecture is very diverse. Primary venation is pinnate (rarely palmate). Secondary venation is eucamptodromous, brochidodromous, craspedodromous or cladodromous (rarely reticulodromous) Cladodromous venation, if present is considered diagnostic for Anacardiaceae.Flowers grow at the end of a branch or stem or at an angle from where the leaf joins the stem and have bracts.\nOften with this family, bisexual and male flowers occur on some plants, and bisexual and female flowers are on others, or flowers have both stamens and pistils (perfect).  A calyx with three to seven cleft sepals and the same number of petals, occasionally no petals, overlap each other in the bud.  Stamens are twice as many or equal to the number of petals, inserted at the base of the fleshy ring or cup-shaped disk, and inserted below the pistil(s).\nStamen stalks are separate, and anthers are able to move.\nFlowers have the ovary free, but the petals and stamen are borne on the calyx.\nIn the stamenate flowers, ovaries are single-celled.  In the pistillate flowers, ovaries are single or sometimes quadri- or quinticelled.  One to three styles and one ovule occur in each cavity.Fruits rarely open at maturity\nand are most often drupes.Seed coats are very thin or are crust-like. Little or no endosperm is present.   Cotyledons are fleshy.\nSeeds are solitary with no albumen around the embryo.\n\nTaxonomy\nHistory\nIn 1759, Bernard de Jussieu arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme. That classification included a description of an order called the Terebintaceæ, which contained a suborder that included Cassuvium (Anacardium), Anacardium (Semecarpus), Mangifera, Connarus, Rhus, and Rourea.  In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, nephew of Bernard de Jussieu, published that classification scheme.Robert Brown described a subset of the Terebintaceae called Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ in 1818, using the herbarium that was collected by Christen Smith during a fated expedition headed by James Hingston Tuckey to explore the River Congo.  The name and genera were based on the order with the same name that had been described by de Jussieu in 1759.  The herbarium from that expedition contained only one genus from the family, Rhus.Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, used Robert Brown's name Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ, wrote another description of the group, and filled it with the genera Anacardium, Semecarpus, Holigarna, Mangifera, Buchanania, Pistacia, Astronium, Comocladia, and Picramnia.John Lindley described the \"essential character\" of the Anacardiaceæ, the \"Cashew Tribe\" in 1831, adopting the order that was described by de Jussieu, but abandoning the name Terebintaceæ.  He includes the genera that were found in de Candolle's Anacardieæ and Sumachineæ: Anacardium, Holigarna, Mangifera, Rhus, and Mauria.\n\nPhylogeny\nThe genus Pistacia has sometimes been separated into its own family, the Pistaciaceae, based on the reduced flower structure, differences in pollen, and the feathery style of the flowers.The nature of its ovary, though,  does suggest it belongs in the Anacardiaceae, a position supported by morphological and molecular studies, and recent classifications have included Pistacia in the Anacardiaceae. The genus Abrahamia was separated from Protorhus in 2004.(Pell 2004)\n\nSubdivision\nThe family has been treated as a series of five tribes by Engler, and later into subfamilies by Takhtajan, as Anacardioideae (including tribes Anacardieae, Dobineae, Rhoideae, and Semecarpeae) and Spondiadoideae (including tribe Spondiadeae). Pell's (2008) molecular analysis reinstated the two subfamilies without further division into tribes (Pell 2004). Later, Min and Barfod, in the Flora of China (2008) reinstated the five tribes (four in Anacardioideae), and the single tribe Spondiadeae as Spondiadoideae.\n\nSelected genera\nEcology\nThe cashew family is more abundant in warm or tropical regions with only a few species living in the temperate zones. Mostly native to tropical Americas, Africa and India.  Pistacia and some species of Rhus can be found in southern Europe,  Rhus species can be found in much of North America and Schinus inhabits South America exclusively.\n\nUses\nMembers of this family produce cashew and pWC.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBand-e Amir National Park\nBand-e Amir National Park (Persian: بند امیر) Afghanistan established its first national park on April 22, 2009, to promote and protect the natural beauty of a series of intensely blue lakes created by natural dams high in the Hindu Kush. Band-e-Amir is a chain of six lakes in the mountainous desert of central Afghanistan. The lakes formed from mineral-rich water that seeped out of faults and cracks in the rocky landscape. Over time, the water deposited layers of hardened mineral (travertine) that built up into walls that now contain the water. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, who helped the Afghan government set up the park, Band-e-Amir is one of the few travertine systems in the world.They were created by the carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults and fractures to deposit calcium carbonate precipitate in the form of travertine walls that today store the water of these lakes. Band-e Amir is one of the few rare natural lakes in the world which are created by travertine systems. The site of Band-e Amir has been described as Afghanistan's Grand Canyon, and draws thousands of tourists a year. The river is part of the system of the Balkh River.\n\nHistory\nThe name Band-e Amir literally means \"the Ruler's Dam\" which is believed by some to be a reference to Ali, the fourth Caliph of the Muslims. The area is dominated by ethnic Hazaras, who are estimated to make up about 40 percent of Afghanistan's population.In her 1970 guide to Afghanistan, Nancy Dupree wrote that a full description about Band-e Amir would \"rob the uninitiated of the wonder and amazement it produces on all who gaze upon it\". Parts of the 1975 Bollywood film Dharmatma, with Feroz Khan and Hema Malini, were filmed at the Band-e Amir National Park.In 2004, Band-e Amir was submitted for recognition as a World Heritage site. Efforts to make Band-e Amir a national park started in the 1970s, but were then put on hold due to the wars. In April 2009, Band-e Amir was finally declared Afghanistan's first national park. As of 2013, about 6,000 local tourists visit the Band-e Amir National Park every year. The area is protected by a small number of park rangers.\n\nGeography\nBand-e Amir is situated at approximately 75 km to the north-west of the ancient city of Bamyan, close to the town of Yakawlang. Together with Bamyan Valley, they are the heart of Afghanistan's tourism, attracting thousands of tourists every year and from every corner of the world. The Band-e Amir lakes are primarily a late spring and summertime tourism destination, as the high elevation central Hazarajat region of Afghanistan is extremely cold in winter, with temperatures reaching as low as −20 °C (−4.0 °F). The six constituent lakes of Band-e Amir are:\n\nBand-e Gholaman (Lake of the slaves)\nBand-e Qambar (Lake of Caliph Ali's slave)\nBand-e Haibat (Lake of grandiose)\nBand-e Panir (Lake of cheese)\nBand-e Pudina (Lake of wild mint)\nBand-e Zulfiqar (Lake of the sword of Ali)The white travertine dams created by fault lines, which are prevalent in the Band-e Amir Valley, form the barriers between the lakes. Band-e Haibat is the biggest and the deepest of the six, with an average depth of approximately 150 metres, as estimated by the Provincial Reconstruction Team diving team from New Zealand. Another comparable lake is Band-e Azhdahar (The Dragon), located a few kilometres southeast of the town of Bamyan, which has also been created as a result of carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults underground and depositing calcium carbonate precipitate to form the travertine walls of Band-e Amir.\n\nClimate\nHigh in the Hindu Kush at approximately 2,900 metres (9,500 ft) above sea level, the national park has a subarctic climate (Dsc) closely bordering on a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dsb). The climate is extremely severe and the lakes freezing over in winter.\n\nCurrent status\nAfter the formal establishment of the park in 2009, a park office with a park warden and a group of rangers was installed to manage the conservation and protection of park natural resources. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is the only non-government organization with an office in the park. WCS supports park staff and works with the local community to promote conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Ecotourism is expected to decrease local economic dependency on the park's natural resources. Tourists visit Band-e-Amir primarily in the summer months when the weather is warm. A poor local economy and limited outside investment have hampered efforts to attract winter tourism.\nThe local people in Band-e-Amir National Park rely heavily on the park's natural resources for their livelihood. Grazing of livestock, collection of shrubs for fuel and winter fodder and rain-fed farming is still widely practiced within the park boundary. Although the illegal hunting of birds and a few mammals living in the park is formally prohibited by the park office, there is no current data to evaluate the status of wildlife and biodiversity.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 41,000 ha tract overlapping the national park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Himalayan snowcocks, Hume's larks, white-winged snowfinches, Afghan snowfinches and Eurasian crimson-winged finches.\n\nSee also\nList of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan\nNatural areas of Afghanistan\nWakhan National Park\nNuristan National Park\nPassage 2:\nQasim Oryakhail\nQasim Oryakhail (born 10 January 1992) is an Afghan cricketer.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\n1958 Pro Bowl\nThe 1958 Pro Bowl was the NFL's eighth annual all-star game which featured the outstanding performers from the 1957 season. The game was played on January 12, 1958, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California in front of 66,634 fans. The West squad defeated the East by a score of 26–7.The West team was led by the Detroit Lions' George Wilson while Buddy Parker of the Pittsburgh Steelers coached the East squad. San Francisco 49ers running back Hugh McElhenny was selected as the outstanding back of the game and defensive end Gene Brito of the Washington Redskins was named the outstanding lineman.This was the first Pro Bowl to be televised nationally (except in the Los Angeles market where it was blacked out).\nPassage 2:\nLos Angeles Memorial Coliseum\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (also known as the L.A. Coliseum) is a multi-purpose stadium in the Exposition Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Conceived as a hallmark of civic pride, the Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to Los Angeles veterans of World War I. Completed in 1923, it will become the first stadium to have hosted the Summer Olympics three times when it hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics; the stadium previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 27, 1984, a day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.The stadium serves as the home of the University of Southern California Trojans football team of the Pac-12 Conference, and is located directly adjacent to the school’s main University Park campus.\nThe Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California's Sixth District Agricultural Association, Los Angeles County, and the city of Los Angeles. It is managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California (USC).USC granted naming rights to United Airlines in January 2018. After concerns were raised by the Coliseum Commission, which has public oversight of USC's management and operation of the Coliseum, the airline agreed to become the title sponsor of the playing field, naming it United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.The Coliseum was the home of the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, and again from 2016 to 2019, prior to the team's move to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the Pac-12 Conference and the NFL. The stadium also was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1958 to 1961, and was the host venue for games three, four, and five of the 1959 World Series. It was the site of the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game (later called Super Bowl I) and Super Bowl VII. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the 1960 inaugural season for the Los Angeles Chargers, the Los Angeles Raiders of the NFL from 1982 to 1994, and UCLA Bruins football. \nFrom 1959 to 2016, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was located adjacent to the Coliseum before it closed in March 2016. BMO Stadium, formerly Banc of California Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium and the home of Major League Soccer (MLS)'s Los Angeles FC, was constructed on the former Sports Arena site, and opened in 2018.\nIn 2019 USC completed a two year long major renovation of the stadium that included replacing the seating along with the addition of luxury boxes and club suites.  The $315 million project, funded solely by the university and managed by architectural firm DLR Group, was the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years. The improvements and added amenities resulted in a reduced stadium capacity from 92,348 to 77,500.\n\nOperation\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which consists of six voting members appointed by the three ownership interests and meets on a monthly basis, provides public oversight of the master lease agreement with USC. Under the lease, the University has year-round day-to-day management and operation responsibility for both the Coliseum and BMO Stadium properties. USC's Vice President of Auxiliary Services is also the Chief Operating Officer of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and Coliseum employees are employees of the university. Until 2013, USC had a series of mostly one and two year agreements with the Coliseum Commission – which up to that time had been directly operating the stadium. Those agreements were limited to the University only renting the stadium for USC home football games. On July 29, 2013, after the previously governing Coliseum Commission failed to deliver promised renovations, the Coliseum Commission and USC implemented a significantly more extensive master lease agreement that transferred to USC the responsibility for the long-term management and operation of both the Coliseum and the adjacent BMO Stadium property and the capital renewal of the Coliseum. The 98-year agreement required the University to make approximately $100 million in initial physical repairs to the Coliseum. Additionally, it requires USC pay $1.3 million each year in rent to the State of California for the state-owned land the property occupies in Exposition Park; maintain the Coliseum's physical condition at the same standard used on the USC Campus; and assume all financial obligations for the operations and maintenance of the Coliseum and BMO Stadium Complex.\n\nUSC\nThe Coliseum is primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team. Most of USC's regular home games, especially the alternating games with rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, attract a capacity crowd. The current official capacity of the Coliseum is 77,500, with 42 suites, 1,100 club seats, 24 loge boxes, and a 500-person rooftop terrace. USC's women lacrosse and soccer teams use the Coliseum for selected games, usually involving major opponents and televised games. USC also rents the Coliseum to various events, including international soccer games, musical concerts and other large outdoor events.In May 2021, due to the previous year of local COVID-19 restrictions, USC held commencement ceremonies in the Coliseum for graduating students from the classes of 2020 and 2021. Ceremonies were held in the Coliseum twice a day for a week, with over 36,000 diplomas (including undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates) were awarded. It was the first time in 70 years that USC had held its commencement in the stadium.\n\nHistory\nPlanning\nThe Coliseum was commissioned in1971 to 1974. A nephew, Hans, son of his brother, Clark, also played professional football. In 1975 and 1976, the Rams defense finished second in the NFL against the run while ranking in the top five in sacking opposing quarterbacks and compiling a 22-5-1 record over those two seasons.\nOlsen's last game was the NFC Championship game in 1976 at Bloomington, Minnesota. The Vikings took advantage on a freak play early in the game. A blocked field goal returned 90 yards for a touchdown shocked the Rams in the first quarter. The defense was later victimized by a couple of big plays by the Vikings. The Rams came up short, losing 24–13, bringing the storied career of the Rams' finest defensive tackle to an end.\nOlsen made the Pro Bowl a then-record 14 times, missing it only in his final year. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982 in his first year of eligibility; he selected his college position coach Tony Knap as his presenter. In 1999, Olsen was ranked 25th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.\n\nEntertainment\nOlsen enjoyed continued success after the NFL as a broadcaster, actor, and businessman.Olsen served as a television color commentator, teaming mostly with Dick Enberg on NBC's coverage of the AFC during the late 1970s and almost all of the 1980s. He and Enberg also teamed for four Super Bowls (XV, XVII, XX and XXIII), as well as nine Rose Bowls from 1980 to 1988. Olsen also worked Super Bowl XIII in 1979 with Curt Gowdy and John Brodie (Enberg was then serving as pre-game/halftime/post-game host). In 1989, Olsen was replaced by Bill Walsh as NBC's lead NFL color commentator. For the 1989 season, Olsen worked with Charlie Jones on NBC's broadcasts. In 1990 and 1991, he moved to CBS Sports doing NFL games with Dick Stockton.\nOlsen developed a successful career as an actor. He appeared as the character Little George in the John Wayne movie, The Undefeated, with Rams teammate Roman Gabriel, in 1969.\nIn 1970, he appeared once on Petticoat Junction, in the episode: \"With This Ring\".  He played mountaineer Merlin Fergus.\nWhen Little House on the Prairie actor Victor French left to star in his own comedy Carter Country in 1977, Olsen was tapped to play Michael Landon's new sidekick Jonathan Garvey for several years. One memorable quote from his character's son, Andy Garvey, \"My pa doesn't know anything about football!\" came when Andy's friends suggested that Jonathan coach their football team.\nOlsen played the starring role of John Michael Murphy in the 1981-83 NBC television drama series Father Murphy.\nIn the Highway to Heaven episode 2.12 (\"The Good Doctor\"), the main character, Alex, tells Mark Gordon (Victor French) that \"All I could see was the flowers and the beard.  I thought you were Merlin Olsen.\" This is an inside joke since all three actors, Merlin Olsen, Michael Landon, and Victor French were in the TV series Little House On the Prairie  earlier in their careers.\nOlsen's last acting work was in the short-lived 1988 TV series Aaron's Way.\nOlsen was also the commercial spokesman for FTD Florists for many years. A part-time resident of the Coachella Valley, Olsen was the longtime radio and television spokesman for Palm Desert-based El Paseo Bank.Olsen also appeared in many Sigma Chi fraternity promotional campaigns; Merlin, along with his brother Phil, was a Life Loyal Sig, Significant Sig (given to members for distinguishing acts outside the fraternity) and a member of the Order of Constantine (given for service to the Fraternity). Olsen donated one of his cleats, which were bronzed, to be used during the annual football rivalry between two Las Vegas high schools, Eldorado High School and Chaparral High School, which both opened in 1973. Each year, Olsen presented the \"trophy\" in the ceremony at the rivalry game.Olsen often co-hosted the Children's Miracle Network telethons, a humanitarian organization founded in 1983 by Marie Osmond and John Schneider.\n\nAwards\nHe was named the Walter Camp Man of the Year in 1982 and Athlete of the Century for the state of Utah. During halftime of a basketball game between Utah State, Olsen's alma mater, and Saint Mary's on December 5, 2009, Utah State University announced that the playing surface inside Romney Stadium, home stadium for the university's football program, would be named Merlin Olsen Field in Olsen's honor. Because of Olsen's illness, Utah State decided not to wait until the 2010 football season to hold the ceremony; he was able to attend the game, but did not speak. A sculpture of Olsen was unveiled in a plaza south of the stadium during an official dedication ceremony in Fall 2010.In 1979, Olsen was inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame.In 1980, Olsen was inducted into the National College Football Hall of Fame.In 1998, Olsen was inducted into the Utah Tourism Hall of Fame.Olsen was voted to the California Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2010, along with Bill Walton, Dwight Stones, and Jim Otto, among others.In 1983, Olsen served as Grand Marshal of the Rose Parade.\n\nPersonal life\nOn March 30, 1962, Olsen married Susan Wakley, a fellow USU student. They had three children: Kelly, Jill, and Nathan. \nOlsen was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and a resident of San Marino, California.Olsen was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in 2009, and underwent three courses of chemotherapy. In December 2009, he filed a lawsuit against 25 defendants including NBC Studios, NBC Universal, 20th Century Fox, Georgia Pacific, Sherwin-Williams, and Lennox Corp. for allegedly exposing him to the asbestos which he claimed had caused his cancer.Olsen died on March 11, 2010, at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, at the age of 69.Olsen is buried at San Gabriel Cemetery in San Gabriel, California.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

However, an error resulted in Canton being interpreted as referring to the Province of Canton (Now Guangdong, 廣東), resulting in the Chinese name of the road becoming 廣東道 instead of the intended 廣州道.\n\nSections and features\nCanton Road is not one continuous road, instead, it is divided into four sections, interrupted by a major housing estate (Prosperous Garden) and disjointed by a traffic intersection (Jordan Road) as the result of urban development in the past hundred years.\nThe following list follows a south-north order. (W) indicates the western side of the road, while (E) indicates the eastern side.\n\nTsim Sha Tsui section\nThe section starts at Salisbury Road and ends at Jordan Road. Features include:\n\n(W) Star House, at the intersection with Salisbury Road and facing the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier Bus Terminus\n(E) Former Marine Police Headquarters Compound, at the intersection with Salisbury Road. A declared monument, it has been renamed \"1881 Heritage\" and re-developed into a shopping mall and hotel.\n(W) Harbour City, which contains the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, the Ocean Terminal, the Ocean Centre and The Gateway\n(E) One Peking office and shopping mall tower, at the junction with Peking Road\n(E) > junction with Peking Road\n(E) Silvercord (新港中心) and the Silvercord Arcade (No. 30), at the junction with Haiphong Road\n(E) > junction with Haiphong Road\n(E) > junction with Kowloon Park Drive\n(W) China Hong Kong City, which contains the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal\n(E) A small portion of Kowloon Park\n(E) Lai Chack Middle School (No. 180)\n(W) Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station (No. 333)\n(E) Victoria Towers (No. 188), at the junction with Austin Road\n(E) > junction with Austin Road\n(W) Exit F of Austin MTR station\n(W) [Demolished] Canton Road Government Offices (廣東道政府合署) (No. 393).

The plan was put off after unsuccessful negotiation between KCRC and The Wharf on financial arrangement. Another station, Austin, near the junction of Canton Road and Wui Cheung Road in Kwun Chung opened on 16 August 2009.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe final shootout sequence of the 2003 film PTU, directed by Johnnie To, takes place in Canton Road. The sequence was actually shot in Ap Lei Chau.\n\nGallery\nTsim Sha Tsui section\nSee also\nShanghai Street, a 2.3 km long street, generally parallel to Canton Road and Nathan Road\nList of streets and roads in Hong Kong\nPassage 2:\nJimaní\nJimaní is the capital and the second largest city of the Independencia Province of the Dominican Republic. It serves as one of the two main border crossings to Haiti (with DajabSide. The new \"West-End\" bus (originally called \"Southwest\" and running every half-hour) was changed into a one-hour route that extended to cover the V.A. Clinic on Spring Creek Drive and Zoo Montana on Shiloh Road and Pierce Parkway. The route was directed down Shiloh to Shiloh Crossing, a shopping center on Shiloh Road and King Avenue West. Routes 1M, 5D, 9D, 10D, S5, and S9 also faced changes. Route 1M changed by adding an hour and a half of service each weekday and further service down 6th Ave N. Route 5D is now known as Route 5D1 Grand 1 and Route 5D2 Grand 2. The new Grand routes run to 32nd St W off of Grand Ave instead of to 28th St W. Route 9D Central has been changed to travel down 1st Ave S during its Outbound times. Route 10D Southside serves 4th Ave S on its outbound times.\nIn 2014, the MET began a new program for disabled veterans. Disabled veterans can ride free on all the MET bus routes as long as the individuals show the MET driver their Department of Veterans Affairs identification card indicating \"Service Connected\"; the vet is not required to have a bus pass.\nAlso in 2014, the MET will provide its first shuttle service to the Magic Blues Fest at south park. Service will run from 14:00-23:00 and the bus will run 4 times an hour.\nIn May 2016, the City Council approved a four-year phased-in approach to increase bus fares. The monthly bus passes will increase by $4 beginning July 1, 2016 for the first year. Each year thereafter on July 1; the monthly passes will increase by $2 until July 1, 2019. The overall increase for adult, youth, senior and disabled monthly passes will have an accumulative increase of $10 by fiscal year 2020.\nCash fares also increased on July 1, 2016. Adult cash fares went up from $1.25 to $1.75, Youth from $1.25 to $1.50, and the Senior/Disabled cash fare from $0.50 to $0.85. Day Passes are $4. Under 6 ride for free with fare-paying rider, limit 3. And, transfers are free per use upon paying a cash fare; good for 90 minutes of being issued.\nAdditionally at the May 23, 2016 City Council meeting, the Council approved the elimination of four unproductive routes. The eliminated routes are the 2 Rimrock, 4 Parkhill, 6 Lewis, and 8 Miles and will end service on July 30.\nIn July, 2018 the MET made changes to Route 1-MET Link having it travel to Billings Logan International Airport for the first time and Route 13-Westend travel to St. Josephine Crossing allowing transfers between routes 13-Westend and 19-The Loop at Midland and Mullowney. In October, 2018 bus tracking technology was made available to the public through the Double Map bus tracking app.\nIn February, 2020 MET added free public WiFi to all its buses.\n\nServices\nThe MET serves all five wards in the city of Billings with easily identifiable buses; they have green and blue diagonal bands. The route name is displayed over the windshield and side window while the route number is also displayed in the windshield's lower left corner. The MET stops at most corners or at blue and green MET bus signs. However, over the next 12-18 months, MET Transit will only stop at designated bus stops.\n\nWeekday routes\n1 - MET Link\n3 - Crosstown\n5A - Grand\n5B - Grand\n7 - Broadwater\n9 - Central\n10 - Southside\n13 - Westend\n14 - Alkali\n15 - Hilltop\n16 - Main\n17 - Bench\n18 - Heights\n19 - The Loop\n24 - Poly\n\nSchool Runs\n(these routes are open to the public and operate during public middle school days.)\n\nT1 Castlerock\nT2 Riverside\nT3 Will James\nT4 Lewis & Clark\n\nSaturday Routes\nS3 - Crosstown\nS5 - Grand\nS7 - Broadwater\nS9 - Central\nS13 - Westend\nS18 - Heights\nS19 - The Loop\n\nFormer Routes\n2 - Rimrock\n4 - Parkhill\n6 - Lewis\n8 - Miles\n11 - Northwest\n12 - Overland Ave.\n\nSpecial Services\nPark-n-Ride\nBike & Ride\nService Connected - Free transit service for disabled veterans\n\nMet Plus\nMET Plus provides paratransit service to citizens who are unable to use MET Transit's fixed route bus service due to a disability.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSpider9\nSpider9 Inc. is an American environmental technologies company headquartered in Northville, MI which develops and manufactures advanced control systems for energy storage and solar fields. It was founded in 2011 by Glynne Townsend (A123 Systems), Dave Park (former Vice President of Production at Wave Crest Energy Systems), Dave Smith (former chairman of USABC), and Bill Beckman (former Vice President of Finance at Johnson Controls).Spider9 acquired control system technology from the University of Michigan, Office of Technology Transfer and is developing the technology at their facilities at the Water Wheel Centre, in the historic Ford Valve Plant.\n\nHistory\nSpider9 was founded on control system technology patents licensed from the University of Michigan Real-Time Computing Laboratory. In the summer of 2011, the Spider9 leadership team brought the technology out of the Office of Technology Transfer, where it had been incubating. In July 2011, Spider9 pivoted the technology's business plan to target grid energy storage and solar field optimization rather than electric vehicles. On November 3, 2011, Spider9 received a Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) grant to install a solar field on the roof of the Water Wheel Centre in Northville, MI.\n\nTechnology\nSpider9 systems are capable of reconfiguring the architecture of systems through in-house developed hardware and software algorithms. Using a Spider9 system, individual cells and panels are monitored and managed. The system architecture is dynamically reconfigured around the components to deliver a consistent voltage output, compensating for performance variances and failures.\n\nFacilities\nSpider9's facilities are equipped with a waterwheel designed by Albert Kahn (architect) which once provided constant, sustainable hydroelectric power to the facility. The waterwheel no longer fulfills the electricity needs of the building. Spider9 is designing a control system for an 85 kW rooftop solar field with backup battery storage to supply the building with renewable power.\nPassage 2:\nA123 Systems\nA123 Systems, LLC, a subsidiary of the Chinese Wanxiang Group Holdings, is a developer and manufacturer of lithium iron phosphate batteries and energy storage systems.\nThe company was founded in 2001 by Yet-Ming Chiang, Bart Riley, and Ric Fulop. By 2009, it had about 2,500 employees globally and was headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Its original product technology was based upon materials initially developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHistory\nIn November 2005, the company announced a new, faster-recharging lithium-ion battery system based on doped nanophosphate materials licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn December 2006, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the company a US$15 million development contract to optimize A123 Systems' proprietary doped nano-phosphate battery technology for hybrid electric vehicle applications with a focus on power, abuse tolerance, durability and cost. USABC is an organization composed of Chrysler LLC Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation.BAE Systems announced that, from 2008, it would offer A123 Systems' lithium-ion battery technology as part of its HybriDrive Propulsion System used in the 2008 version of the Daimler Orion VII hybrid electric buses. As of September 7, 2009, more than 3,000 of the buses were in service.In May 2008, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the company a US$12.5 million grant to develop its lithium ion battery technology for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.On March 5, 2008, General Electric, the company, and Think Global announced that the three firms had entered a partnership to enable global electrification of transportation. GE invested US$20 million in the company to help it roll out batteries for Think. The company and Think at the same time signed a commercial supply agreement. The partnership was announced at the 78th annual international Motor Show in Geneva. After over $10 million in investment in the Think Global Think City, A123 ceased production of its L20 battery pack for Think after a single day of production in December, 2008.\nIn January 2009, A123 systems applied to the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVMLP) for US$1.84 billion in direct loans to support the construction of new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities in the United States, locating the first plant in southeast Michigan near Detroit. The application was still pending as of early 2012, the company estimated that it might be allowed to borrow up to US$233 million from the program.In April 2009, Chrysler Corp. announced a contract with A123 to supply batteries for their ENVI EV vehicles.In August 2009, the company received a US$249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVMLP) to build production facilities in Romulus and Livonia, Mich. after it received a US$125 million in tax credits and incentives from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in spring and a US$10 million grant from the state in fall 2008.In September 2009, the company raised US$380 million after going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange.In 2009, the company was included on the Guardian's \"Global Cleantech 100\" list. Later, A123 was selected to Technology Review Magazine's list of the 50 Most Innovative Companies 2011.Chrysler's ENVI division was disbanded by Nov 2009.In December 2009, the company formed a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the largest automaker in China. This was the first joint venture between a Chinese automaker and a non-Chinese battery supplier. The new venture is called Advanced Traction Battery Systems (ATBS).In August 2010, A123's co-founder Professor Yet-Ming Chiang spun off a new company from A123 named 24M Technologies, which makes technology that combines concepts in current lithium ion batteries with flow batteries, where tanks of liquid electrolytes combine to create an electric current.In 2010, A123 received a US$249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for building battery production facilities. Approximately $129 million of the grant was used to build a 550 MWh battery plant in Livonia and another in Romulus. An untapped $120 million grant was abandoned by A123 by May 2012.In September 2010, the company opened the largest lithium ion battery manufacturing facility in North America in Livonia, Michigan. When fully operationalxiang had earlier lost out to Hybrid in bidding for purchase of the government's loan to Fisker. Wanxiang owns A123 Systems LLC, Fisker's former battery supplier, and Fisker argued that Wanxiang's conduct was partly responsible for Fisker's business failure. As part of its bid, Wanxiang proposed restarting production of the Karma.Wanxiang received court approval on February 18, 2014, to buy the assets of Fisker after a three-day auction against Hybrid with a bid of $149.2 million, with bidding starting at $55 million, significantly more than the previous $24.75 million bid, and significantly higher than the $25 million Hybrid Technology LLC paid the Department of Energy for a $164 million loan note. On top of the $25 million, the DOE also recouped $28 million from Fisker for a total of $53 million recovered of its $192 million loan.Following Fisker Automotive's structured bankruptcy auction in February 2014, Henrik Fisker retained the Fisker logo and trademarks. Wanxiang Group then transformed the assets of Fisker Automotive into a new company named Karma Automotive, thus launching the Karma Revero plug-in hybrid car based on the Fisker Karma. Henrik Fisker would later start another electric vehicle company named Fisker Inc in 2016 with the Fisker logo and trademarks.\n\nProduction models\nFisker Karma\nThe Karma was a plug-in hybrid luxury sports sedan produced by Fisker Automotive and manufactured at Valmet Automotive in Finland. After missing its initial late 2009 launch, and after the launch was rescheduled several times, the first deliveries took place in the U.S. in late July 2011 and deliveries to retail customers began in November 2011.\nThe 20.1 kWh (72.36 MJ) lithium ion rechargeable battery in each car came from A123 Systems in Watertown, Massachusetts. The aluminum frame was engineered by Fisker and was supplied by Norsk Hydro from Norway. The cabin interior was designed by Fisker Automotive, but was made in the United States by Magna International of Canada. The EVer powertrain system, technically a series hybrid, delivered over 400 horsepower, and was inspired by Quantum Technologies, a cofounder of and early investor in Fisker. A version of the Karma was relaunched as the Karma Revero in 2016 by Karma Automotive.\n\nSales\nBy February 2012, Fisker had established 45 dealerships in the US and three in Canada. By March 2012, the company had built over 2,450 vehicles, with over 2000 cars delivered to customers by the end of 2012. Fisker Automotive distributed vehicles through a traditional dealer network and partnered with five importers: GP Supercars (Merano, Italy), Nellemann (Copenhagen, Denmark); the Emil Frey Group (Zurich, Switzerland); BD Otomotive (Istanbul, Turkey) and Al-Futtaim Group (Middle East and North Africa).\n\nManufacturing\nFisker Automotive used to retain core competencies, such as design, engineering and marketing, in house, but outsourced manufacturing of its first vehicle Fisker Karma. Fisker's outsourcing methods allowed the company a 2–3 year period of development instead of the typical 5 years and at a cost of US$333 million instead of $1 billion, and claimed that it could make a profit from selling just 15,000 cars. Fisker used to save significant development costs by using pre-engineered components developed by other car companies whenever possible, such as the door handle mechanism which was a General Motors part; Fisker Automotive just paid a royalty to GM for each door handle in the Karma, which was much cheaper than designing its own door handles. However, the A123 battery failure and its resulting recall, and the eventual bankruptcy of the battery supplier, led to significant problems and added cost to the manufacture of the Karma model, finally resulting in Fisker's bankruptcy.\nIn 2008, Fisker estimated 15,000 cars per year would be assembled by Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki, Finland. Manufacturing eventually commenced in 2011 but by the third quarter of 2012 production ceased.Then-Vice President of the United States Joe Biden (later President) attended the October 27, 2009, announcement that Fisker Automotive would take control of the Boxwood Road Plant (previously owned and operated by General Motors as Wilmington Assembly) in Wilmington, Delaware, with production scheduled to begin in late 2012. This never happened and the plant was ultimately torn down.\n\nFunding\nFisker Automotive's investors have included Leonardo DiCaprio, Palo Alto Investors, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Qatar Holdings, LLC, A123 Systems, and Ace Investments.\nIn April 2012, Fisker announced it had received $392 million in a round of financing, which was in addition to $850 million in private investment it had received in previous rounds. In Fisker's bankruptcy case, Hybrid Technology LLC ranked ahead of all the equity investors as a senior creditor since they purchased the Department of Energy loan note to Fisker Automotive in November 2013. In total, the company raised well over $1 billion from private investors.Fisker had received a US$528.7 million conditional loan in September 2009 from the Department of Energy's US$25 billion Advanced Technologies Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM). Of the total loan amount approved, a total of US$192 million was drawn by Fisker Automotive for engineering work with primarily US suppliers to complete the Fisker Karma and Fisker's Project Nina, later revealed as the Fisker Atlantic.The Department of Energy froze Fisker's credit line in August 2012 after US$192 million had been drawn, and after differences between the DOE and Fisker on the milestones set as conditions for the loan. The loan received additional scrutiny for being awarded for the manufacture of luxury vehicles that are too expensive for much of the general public. Fisker investor Ray Lane responded that the issues were being blown out of proportion due to election-year politics.\n\nSee also\nList of hybrid vehicles\nList of modern production plug-in electric vehicles\nFisker Coachbuild (2005–07)\nKarma Automotive (2014–present)\nFisker Inc.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWLLZ-LP\nWXII-LD (channel 12) is a low-power television station in Cedar, Michigan, United States, serving the Traverse City–Cadillac area with programming from MyNetworkTV and Cozi TV. Owned by Bridge Media Networks, it is sister to Lake City-licensed NewsNet flagship WMNN-LD (channel 26). Both stations share studios on West 13th Street in Cadillac, while WXII-LD's transmitter is located west of downtown Traverse City near Harris and Cedar Run roads.\nDespite having a digital signal of its own, WXII-LD is only 1.5 kW whereas WMNN-LD is 15 kW, so WXII-LD is simulcast over WMNN-LD's fifth digital subchannel (UHF channel 17.5 or virtual channel 26.5) to expand its over-the-air reach.\n\nHistory\nOn December 12, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit for a low-power television station on UHF channel 51 in Pinconning, Michigan with the call sign W51CS. In 2001, the permit was moved to VHF channel 12 in Traverse City under call letters W12CX. In 2003, the call letters were changed to WLLZ-LP. From 1980 to 1996, the WLLZ calls were used by an album oriented rock FM radio station broadcasting on 98.7 in the Detroit area, nicknamed \"Detroit's Wheelz\" (later Smooth Jazz WVMV \"V98.7\" and now top-40 \"AMP Radio\" WDZH). After the FM station dropped the call letters, they were used for several years on an AM station in the market, and were picked up by Channel 12 after the AM station dropped them in 2003. WLLZ's owner at the time, P & P Cable Holdings, is known for picking up calls discarded by other Michigan radio and television stations for use on their own stations.\nWLLZ-LP signed on in January 2004 as an affiliate of Urban America Television. It added America One programming to its schedule in Summer 2004. WLLZ became a full affiliate of the network in May 2006 when Urban America Television ceased operations.\n\nIn June 2008, the station was added to Charter digital channel 202 throughout the northern Lower Peninsula. It moved to the basic tier on channel 72 in December 2008 and has now moved to channel 11 in 18 counties on Charter cable. Also in December 2008, WLLZ became a primary affiliate of MyNetworkTV; the station was then branded as \"My TV 12\". Until then, there was no local affiliate in the northern Michigan market.\nOn May 15, 2009, WLLZ discontinued an affiliation with The Sportsman Channel (which was phasing out its over-the-air affiliations) and added RTV, with America One programming significantly reduced (though not eliminated). Previously from 2007 until 2008, NBC affiliate WPBN-TV (channel 7) carried RTV on a second digital subchannel. This was dropped in favor of a simulcast of ABC affiliate WGTU (channel 29). Due to its low-powered status, WLLZ was exempt from switching to digital-only broadcasting on June 12, 2009.\nThe station discontinued their affiliation with America One in 2015, when it merged with Youtoo TV into Youtoo America, allowing a contractual out of that agreement. With the start of the 2015–16 season, WLLZ has wound down carrying nearly all of their syndicated programming, with Cozi TV being carried most of the day and MyNetworkTV in prime time.\nOn November 1, 2017, the FCC approved the sale of WLLZ-LP to Freelancer Television Broadcasting, Inc. On December 4, 2017, the sale to Freelancer Television Broadcasting was completed, making it a sister station to WMNN-LD; the station then modified its branding to \"MI TV 12\". It changed its call sign to WXII-LP on December 21, 2017.On April 23, 2019, the FCC granted WXII-LP a construction permit to operate a digital companion channel on UHF channel 30. In the meantime, digital over-the-air access to this station had been being provided through a simulcast over a digital subchannel of co-owned station WMNN-LD; that simulcast continued post-transition to improve this station's over-the-air reach and also to feed local cable systems. On September 14, 2021, WXII-LP commenced digital operations and the FCC changed this station's call sign to WXII-LD to reflect this station's new digital operations. Concurrent with the launch of this station's digital operations, an uninterrupted national feed of the NewsNet service, absent of any locally-produced content, was added as a second subchannel.On January 13, 2022, Freelancer Television Broadcasting's portfolio, including NewsNet, WMNN-LD, and WXII-LD, were sold to investor Manoj Bhargava, with Eric Wotila retaining 10% ownership in the new company Bridge News, LLC. Under the terms of the deal, Bridge News would operate the stations via a time brokerage agreement with Freelancer Television Broadcasting. The sale was consummated on March 24.\n\nNews programming\nUntil May 2009, WLLZ aired INN National News, a newscast produced by Independent News Network in Davenport, Iowa from America One. It also carried a video simulcast of an hour of radio station WMKT's morning show hosted by Greg Marshall. The simulcast was discontinued in early 2011.\nIn late 2017, following the station's callsign switch to WXII-LP, sister station WMNN-LD began producing 90-second news updates for channel 12 that aired during prime time over the first commercial break aired each hour. News programming expanded in March 2018, when WMNN-LD began producing hour-long 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts for the station each weeknight. The early newscast competes against a half-hour newscast produced by CBS affiliate WWTV (channel 9) that airs on Fox affiliate WFQX-TV (channel 32), while the 11:00 p.m. competes against longer-established late night newscasts on WWTV (and its Sault Ste. Marie satellite WWUP, channel 10), and WPBN-TV (and its Cheboygan satellite WTOM-TV, channel 4) as well as a pre-recorded broadcast on the latter's sister ABC affiliate, WGTU (and Sault Ste. Marie satellite WGTQ, channel 8).\n\nTechnical information\nSubabout a mile northwest of the Grand Traverse Mall. Another mall, the Cherryland Center, is located on Garfield Avenue on the south end of town; this mall features Big Lots. Two Meijer stores, one Walmart, one Sam's Club, one Costco, one Target, one Menards, and a multitude of local grocery store chains offer grocery and other options to big-box shopping.\n\nTransportation\nAirports\nWith a new terminal completed in 2004, Cherry Capital Airport provides regularly scheduled passenger airline service to Chicago and Detroit, with seasonal flights to Dallas-Fort Worth, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Atlanta, New York City, Denver, Boston, Mesa, Ponte Vedra, St. Petersburg, Orlando, and Newark. It is the fourth largest airport in Michigan. Around the area, there are smaller nearby paved and unpaved airports.\n\nShips and boats\nAdjacent to the airport is Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City, responsible for both maritime and land-based search and rescue operations in the northern Great Lakes region. On April 7, 2010, the USCG designated Traverse City a Coast Guard City. Traverse City is the second city in Michigan and tenth in the country to receive this honor.\nLocated in the harbor of the Great Lakes Maritime Academy is the T/S State of Michigan, a 224-foot (68 m) former Navy submarine surveillance vessel. The vessel is used as a classroom and laboratory while cadets of the academy are underway and shore side.\nA tall ship, the schooner Manitou is berthed at Traverse City, and offers passages to the public.\nNear Traverse City, there are two other tall ships, the schooner Madeline and the 55-foot-long (17 m) replica of the sloop Welcome, an 18th-century British warship sloop, which was built for the 1976 Bicentennial of the American Revolution. They are the only two boats recognized by the State of Michigan for their historic significance. From May through October, trained volunteers conduct tours (when in port), and give a history of the boats and Great Lakes sailing. The Madeline is berthed at Elmwood Township \"Coal Dock\" (Heritage Harbor), West Bayshore, just south of the Elmwood Township Marina Both are maintained by the Maritime Heritage Alliance.\nThe Nauti-Cat, a 43-passenger catamaran books passages on Grand Traverse bay. The Nauti-Cat is the largest commercial sailing catamaran on the Great Lakes at 47 feet (14 m) long, 29 feet (8.8 m) wide and has a 63-foot (19 m) mast. They offer cruises seven days a week, four times a day.\n\nBuses\nThe area is served by Indian Trails Bus service, an intercity bus system that connects to St. Ignace to the north and to Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo to the south. The bus station is located at 107 Hall Street with connection to the BATA transfer station.\nTraverse City also has a public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse and Leelanau region. With link services and a fixed route bus service, called the Loops, serves Traverse City and the urbanized areas of Garfield Township. BATA put into service its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA's downtown bus transfer terminal on Hall Street opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes.\n\nMajor highways\nUS 31 is a major north–south highway, and serves as the primary thoroughfare through Traverse City. US 31 enters Michigan from Indiana, and runs through communities such as Benton Harbor, Holland, Grand Haven, Muskegon, Ludington, Manistee, Charlevoix, and Petoskey. Throughout its route, US 31 parallels the coast of Lake Michigan.\n M-22 is a scenic highway that parallels the shore of Grand Traverse Bay and Lake Michigan. The highway begins at an intersection in Traverse City, and runs north through Greilickville and Suttons Bay, before turning back south along Lake Michigan, through communities such as Leland, Glen Arbor, Empire, Frankfort, and Onekama, before ending at US 31 near Manistee.\n M-37 is a north–south highway. Largely following the route of US 31 in Traverse City, M-37 exits to the north, running about 18 miles (29 km) up the Old Mission Peninsula before terminating at a cul-de-sac near the Mission Point Lighthouse. South of Traverse City, M-37 runs through communities such as Mesick, Baldwin, Grand Rapids, Hastings, and Battle Creek.\n M-72 is an east–west highway that traverses the width of the Lower Peninsula. Beginning at M-22 in Empire, M-72 follows the Grandview Parkway in Traverse City, and continues east toward communities such as Kalkaska, Grayling, Mio, and Harrisville on Lake Huron.\n\nRailroads\nThe Great Lakes Central Railroad (GLCR) provides freight rail service to the Traverse City area on track owned by the state of Michigan. The tracks were once owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (ex-Pere Marquette Railway) and the Pennsylvania Railroad (ex-Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad) but were purchased by the state in the late 1970s and early 1980s to preserve rail service in the area. Current freight traffic includes fruit/perishables, scrap metal, and lumber.\nOn February 20, 1982, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway stopped using the line after the last long train serve Traverse City. Then the railroad was dismantled next year from Manistee to Grawn and from Williamsburg to Charlevoix.Since then, excursion passengers trains have operated in and out of Traverse City on an irregular basis. Recently, Lake Central Rail Tours has operated a summer excursion during the Cherry Festival until 2008. On May 11, 1996, the Grand Traverse Dinner Train began year round service from the Traverse City depot to Williamsburg and to Walton Junction. Dinner train service was suspended in 2004 after a contract dispute with the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay Railway and additional difficulties. The train itself was removed to Owosso in mid-July 2006. However, in 2015 a study was started by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and passenger rail is gaining interest.\n\nSister city\nTraverse City has one sister city:\n Tsuchiyama (Koka), Shiga (Japan).\n\nNotable people\nSee also\nCherry production in Michigan\nFormer Traverse City State Hospital, historical Kirkbride Building\nMunson Medical Center, regional medical referral center serving patients from 32 counties in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula\nWatershed Center Grand Traverse Bay\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCharles Haughey\nCharles James Haughey (; 16 September 1925 – 13 June 2006) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Taoiseach on three occasions – 1979 to 1981, March to December 1982 and 1987 to 1992. Haughey led four governments while serving as Taoiseach; December 1979 to June 1981, March to December 1982, March 1987 to June 1989, and June 1989 to February 1992. He was also Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1987 to 1992, Leader of the Opposition from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987, Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1979 to 1992, Minister for Social Welfare and for Health from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Finance from 1966 to 1970, Minister for Agriculture from 1964 to 1966, Minister for Justice from 1961 to 1964 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice from 1959 to 1961. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1957 to 1992.Haughey was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD in 1957 and was re-elected at every election until 1992, representing successively the Dublin North-East, Dublin Artane and Dublin North-Central constituencies.\nHaughey was the dominant Irish politician of his generation, as well as the most controversial. Upon entering government in the early 1960s, Haughey became the symbol of a new vanguard of Irish Ministers. As Taoiseach, he is credited by some economists with starting the positive transformation of the economy in the late 1980s. However, his career was also marked by several major scandals. Haughey was implicated in the Arms Crisis of 1970, which nearly destroyed his career. His political reputation revived, his tenure as Taoiseach was then damaged by the sensational GUBU Affair in 1982; his party leadership was challenged four times, each time unsuccessfully, earning Haughey the nickname \"The Great Houdini\". Revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal forced him to resign as Taoiseach and retire from politics in 1992.\nAfter Haughey's retirement from politics, further revelations of corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and a 27-year extra-marital affair tarnished his already chequered reputation. He died of prostate cancer in 2006, aged 80.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Castlebar, County Mayo in 1925, the third of seven children, of Seán Haughey and Sarah McWilliams, both natives of Swatragh, County Londonderry.  Haughey's father was in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, then in the National Army of the Irish Free State. Seán Haughey left the army in 1928 and the family moved to County Meath; he subsequently developed multiple sclerosis and the family moved again to Donnycarney, a northern suburb of Dublin, where Charles Haughey spent his youth.Haughey was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St Joseph's secondary school in Fairview, where one of his classmates was George Colley, subsequently his cabinet colleague and rival in Fianna Fáil. In his youth he was an active amateur sportsman, playing Gaelic football with the Parnells GAA Club in Donnycarney; he won a Dublin Senior Football Championship medal in 1945. Haughey studied commerce at University College Dublin (UCD), where he took a first class Honours degree in 1946. It was at UCD that Haughey became increasingly interested in politics and was elected Auditor of the Commerce & Economics Society. He also met there one of his future political rivals, Garret FitzGerald.He joined the Local Defence Force during \"The Emergency\" in 1941 and considered a permanent career in the Army. He continued to serve in the reserve FCÁ force, until entering Dáil Éireann in 1957.On VE-day Haughey and other UCD students burnt the British Union Jack on College Green, outside Trinity College Dublin, in response to a perceived disrespect afforded the Irish tricolour among the flags hung by the college in celebration of the Allied victory which ended World War II.\nHaughey qualified as a chartered accountant and also attended King's Inns. He was subsequently called to the Irish Bar. Shortly afterwards, he set up the accountancy firm of Haughey, Boland & Company with Harry Boland, son of Fianna Fáil Minister Gerald Boland.\nOn 18 September 1951, he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of the Fianna Fáil Minister and future Taoiseach Seán Lemass, having been close to her since their days at UCD, where they first met. They had four children together: Eimear, Conor, Ciarán and Seán.After selling his house in Raheny in 1969, Haughey bought Abbeville and its estate of approximately 250 acres (100 ha), located at Kinsealy, north County Dublin.  This historic house, once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford, had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century and it became the Haughey family home, where he lived for the rest of his life. This marked the beginning of a long period when Haughey's spending was well beyond his apparent income level. For the rest of his life Haughey would refuse to say where the extra money came from.\n\nEarly political career\nHe started his political career as a local councillor, being a member of Dublin Corporation from 1953 to 1955. Haughey's first attempt at election to Dáil Éireann came in June 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested the general election. While living in Raheny, Haughey was first elected to the Dáil as a Fianna Fáil TD at the 1957 general election for the Dublin North-East constituency; it was his fourth attempt.\nHaughey was re-elected in every election until 1992, representing Dublin North-East from 1957 to 1977, Dublin Artane from 1977 to 1981, and Dublin North-Central from 1981 until his retirement in 1992 (moving constituencies in line with boundary changes).\nIn 1959, Haughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister forises.  Lynch supporters saw him as exhibiting strength in facing down the rebel ministers and his detractors saw it as an illustration of his weakness on the national question and procrastination in the face of difficult decisions.\nAs state papers relating to the period were released after 1995, further light was shed on the events, questioning the outcome.  Much remains unknown about the truthfulness of the various personalities involved, and what exactly each knew, and when they came to know it. The diaries of Peter Berry, Secretary of the Department of Justice, published in Magill magazine, claimed that Lynch had not been forthright publicly. Documents released through the Freedom of Information Act 30 years later showed that the state had altered statements by Colonel Hefferon to suppress the fact that he and Captain Kelly had kept Gibbons informed. This caused the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to publicly state that Captain Kelly had done nothing wrong.\n\nSee also\nExercise Armageddon\nPassage 8:\nMembers of the 27th Dáil\nThe 27th Dáil was elected at the 1992 general election on 25 November 1992 and met on 14 December 1992.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nTroy, Montana\nTroy is a city in Lincoln County, Montana, United States. The population was 797 at the 2020 census. It lies at the lowest elevation of any settlement in Montana. The town is on U.S. Route 2, near Montana Highway 56, in the Kootenai River gorge by the Kootenai National Forest.\nOriginally inhabited by the Kutenai, Salish, and Piegan Blackfeet tribes, the area was settled by miners in the 1880s. Troy was registered as a town in 1892 and grew quickly after the Great Northern Railway built a freight station there, leading to a boom in workers, miners, their families, and associates. The area narrowly missed wildfire damage in 1910 and expanded its services throughout the following years, though its population would drop due to a series of misfortunes in the late 1920s before rebounding in the following decades. Troy suffered from the area's contamination from nearby vermiculite mines contaminated with particularly fragile asbestos, leading to the town's inclusion in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List status in 2002 and Public Health Emergency event in 2009. According to the EPA, most risk was reduced by 2015.Troy is on U.S. Route 2, between Yaak and Libby. Montana Highway 56 is three miles southeast and the Troy Airport is two miles northwest. The town's economy has historically been supported by mining and logging, while in recent times, mining has remained, with the addition of education, retail, and tourism. Local natural features such as the Kootenai Falls have attracted tourism to the area and have been featured in movies such as The River Wild (1994) and The Revenant (2015). There is a public school district (which created ceramic ornaments used to decorate the National Christmas Tree in 2017) and a public library, and the town is in-district for Flathead Valley Community College.\n\nHistory\nBefore the westward expansion of the United States, various indigenous peoples lived in the area, with the Kutenai and Salish as the most recent and the Piegan Blackfeet earlier. They lived in base camps and seasonal camps based on the availability of plants and fish: \"lower elevations in the winter and ... uplands in the summer and fall,\" with spring camps near camas prairies, which had edible bulbs. Due to the area's geography and settler fears of the Kutenai, the area remained unsettled until gold was discovered in the 1860s and galena and vermiculite in the 1880s. In 1886, the first miners arrived, prospecting on the Kootenai River at a tent camp first known as \"Lake Camp, Lake Creek Camp, and Lake City\", and making land claims on Grouse Mountain. In 1892, a William O'Brien surveyed the Lake City claim, renaming it Troy.\n\nPost American settlement\nThroughout 1892, Troy was filed as a town in then-Missoula County and grew rapidly as the Great Northern Railway chose a nearby site as a \"division yard\", or freight terminal, which was first renamed \"West Troy\" before just becoming Troy itself as the Lake City area was abandoned. The town's first hotel, then called the Windsor Hotel, was built. One transplant described the town as such: \"Fifteen saloons gaily lit filled to the doors with “wild men and wild women” yelling, singing, dancing, and cursing, with glasses held high, such was Troy. Two large dance halls were in evidence, one grocery store run by John Bowen, several 'beaneries' (called restaurants by some), one drug store owned by 'Doc' Sailey and many shacks and tents where the 'wild women' congregated. Fights and ribaldry were the order of the days and nights.\" Another grocery store followed in 1893, the first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1894, and more mining companies, land claims, and support services such as ferries sprung up as gold was discovered on the Yaak River in 1895.The 1910s brought change. After the Windsor Hotel had been destroyed by fire in 1906 and rebuilt in 1907, wildfires during the summer of 1910 narrowly missed Troy by a few miles but raged throughout the area, causing lasting damage to the newly-protected Kootenai National Forest. In 1912, Troy's first bridge across the Kootenai River was built, along with bridges in Libby and Rexford, after a county vote. Previously, crossings were made on horseback – dangerous – or via ferries, which had started operating in 1892. Phone service reached the area in 1913. U.S. Route 2 was proposed and a volunteer fire department was created. The 1918 flu closed the local mill and schools temporarily. By 1920, there was a Chinese restaurant, a church, and an electric plant in town, and World War I increased the town's mining activity; the rapid expansion and labor conditions sometimes led to strikes and labor conflicts.\nThe town's population reached 1000 residents in 1924, and the same year, the town's Lincoln Theatre opened. The population peaked around 1926, but in March of that year, the Great Northern Railway moved its freight terminal elsewhere, leaving \"only three supervisors and [a] small force of Japanese [workers].\" Fires destroyed a concentrator in 1927 and a sawmill in 1928, with neither rebuilt, and the region's mines decreased in activity.The population dropped to as low as 428 during 1930 in the Great Depression. Still, the Lincoln Theatre began playing talking movies and the Windsor Hotel was renamed to the Great Northern Hotel, which stood until it burned down (for the second time) in 1941. A coffee house and cable shop operate on its former location.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMika Häkkinen\nMika Pauli Häkkinen (Finnish: [ˈmikɑ ˈhækːinen] (listen); born 28 September 1968), nicknamed \"The Flying Finn\", is a Finnish former racing driver. He won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 1998 and 1999, both times driving for McLaren. Häkkinen is one of three Formula One drivers from Finland that have won the World Drivers' Championship, and the only one to have done so more than once. He currently works in driver management and is a brand ambassador for various companies.\nHäkkinen began his career in karting at the age of five and achieved success by winning regional and national kart championships. He progressed to car racing when he entered the Formula Ford and Formula Three series in Italy and the United Kingdom. After success in the series, Häkkinen entered Formula One in 1991 with the Team Lotus where he remained until 1992. The following year, he moved to McLaren as test driver before he was promoted to the race team following the departure of Michael Andretti.\nAfter four years which yielded minor success, Häkkinen scored his first Formula One victory in 1997. He went on to win eight races of the 1998 season, securing the World Drivers' Championship at the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix; his success also helped McLaren secure the World Constructors' Championship. He repeated his World Championship success in 1999, taking five victories. He finished as runner-up in the Drivers' Championship in 2000, behind Michael Schumacher and secured two more victories in 2001 before announcing a sabbatical from the sport, which became full-time retirement in mid-2002.\nFor 2005, Häkkinen moved to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series, where he secured his first victory that year. His form faded during 2006 although he secured two more victories in 2007. He retired from top-level active motorsport at the end of 2007, and subsequently moved into driver management along with becoming a brand ambassador for Johnnie Walker and Mercedes-Benz AMG.\n\nEarly life and career\nHäkkinen was born in Helsingin maalaiskunta, Finland, on 28 September 1968 to Harri, a shortwave radio operator and a part-time taxi driver, and Aila Häkkinen, who worked as a secretary. He has one sister, Nina, who ran a fan site for him until its closure in 1998. Häkkinen lived in the same street as Mika Salo with the two later becoming friends. As a child, Häkkinen played ice hockey and football.When Häkkinen was five years old, his parents rented a go-kart for him to take to a track near their home. Despite an early crash, Häkkinen wished to continue racing, and his father bought him his first go-kart, one that Henri Toivonen had previously competed with. He later won his first karting race in 1975 at the Keimola Motor Stadium where he raced in the regional karting championships in 1978 and 1979, winning the Keimola Club Championship in both years. Häkkinen found further success in 1980 when he won the Swedish Lapland Cup and finished fourth in the 85cc class of the Lapland Karting Championship. Around this time, Häkkinen also drove a Volkswagen Beetle on the frozen lakes of Finland with friend Mika Sohlberg.In 1981, Häkkinen won his first major karting title, the 85cc class of the Finnish Karting Championship. The following year, he finished runner-up in the 85cc class of the Formula Mini series and later won the Ronnie Peterson Memorial event and the Salpauselka Cup in Lahti. Häkkinen moved to the Formula Nordic 100cc class for 1983, where he became the champion on his first attempt and also participated in the A Junior Team Races for Finland alongside Taru Rinne, Jaana Nyman and Marko Mankonen, with the line-up taking the championship.In 1984, Häkkinen won the 100cc Formula Nordic title and later participated in the World Kart Championship race held in Liedolsheim. He took his second consecutive 100cc Formula Nordic Championship in 1985 ahead of Jukka Savolainen. He took part in the Nordic Championship A-Class in the same year, finishing runner-up to Tom Kristensen. Häkkinen went to Parma to participate in the World Kart Championship where he retired before the event's final heat due to a mechanical problem. In 1986, he reached his third consecutive Formula Nordic 100cc title and also took part in karting events across Europe. To further fund his career, Häkkinen got a job with a friend repairing bicycles.In 1987, Häkkinen made the transition from karting to car racing when he purchased a 1986 Reynard Formula Ford 1600 from fellow Finn JJ Lehto. In that year, he entered the Finnish, Swedish and Nordic Formula Ford Championships, winning each title on his first attempt and won nine races combined. Häkkinen also entered two races of the EDFA 1600 Championship and raced in the Formula Ford Festival held at Brands Hatch, where he finished in seventh position. In 1988, Häkkinen entered the EFDA Formula GM Lotus Euroseries with the Dragon team, where he secured four victories and finished the runner-up in the championship, behind Allan McNish. He later entered the Opel-Lotus EDFA Euroseries, taking four victories and became Champion with 126 points, ahead of nearest rival Henrik Larsen.Going into 1989, Häkkinen moved from the Euroseries into the British Formula 3 Championship driving a Reynard 893 chassis for Dragon. He finished seventh position in the championship, scoring 18 points. He was later invited to participate in the Cellnet Formula Three SuperPrix for West Surrey Racing as a guest driver where he secured pole position and the victory. He also raced in the tenth round of the French Formula 3 championship at Le Mans-Bugatti on 24 September and finished third behind Éric Hélary and Laurent Daumet.\nIn 1990, Häkkinen applied to become a member of the \"Marlboro World Championship Team\" through what was akin to a fully sponsored racing driver academy. Its members were short-listed for testing by a judging panel including McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis (whose team was sponsored by Marlboro), Formula One World Champion James Hunt, and Formula 3000 team bosses, Mike Earle and Hugues de Chaunac. In an April 2015 interview, Earle recounted that Häkkinen's application was the last one that he reviewed at the end of a long day, despite protests by Hunt who had already made plans to head to a pub for a beer. Häkkinen performed strongly in his test and went on to secure Marlboro's sponsorship. That same year, therefore, Häkkinenfuel capacity limit of 195 litres, rather than the 220 litre limit in effect from 1984 to 1985. With addition of side-ducted radiators, the car's basic exterior shape was all-new and sleeker than its bulbous looking predecessor with the only visual reminder of the car being its nose section, though this too had been re-designed and was in fact lower and approximately 10% smaller. The suspension set up of the new car was virtually identical to the MP4/2C\nTo many, the MP4/3 seemed to have been designed along the lines of the lowline Brabham BT55 used by the Brabham team in 1986. Brabham's long time designer Gordon Murray had joined McLaren in 1987 as its new Technical Director taking over from Barnard and this led to the popular belief that he had played a major role in the design of the new look McLaren. However, team manager Jo Ramírez downplayed Murray's involvement in the design of the MP4/3, saying that the BT55's design had no bearing on the car and that Murray had primarily been in charge of quality control. However, Murray himself has since said that this car, and its successor the McLaren MP4/4, were designed using his original Brabham BT55 drawings as a base (as they were legally his, Murray had brought the BT55's drawings with him to McLaren). The claim has since been disputed by engineering director Steve Nichols.\n\nEngine\nThe engine was the same 1.5 litre, Porsche built, TAG funded and badged twin-turbo V6 engine that had so successfully powered the MP4/2, but with slight changes in compression and engine balancing, to cope with not only the new reduced fuel limit, but also with the FIA's mandated pop-off valve which restricted turbo boost to 4.0 bar after turbo charging was unrestricted prior to 1987.\n\nSuccess\nThere were three wins in 1987 with the MP4/3 by Alain Prost at Grand Prix of Brazil, Belgium, and Portugal. Stefan Johansson managed a few podium places, but he would be replaced in 1988 by Ayrton Senna. McLaren still managed to finish 2nd overall, with 76 points, in the Constructor's Championship. The MP4/3 represented the pinnacle of the development of the McLaren TAG-Porsche partnership. The Porsche-TAG engine featured an updated Motronic 1.7 engine management system, and now produced 790 bhp (590 kW) in race trim and up to 850 bhp (630 kW) in qualifying.\nAlthough a number of teams, notably Benetton with their Ford V6 turbo and Arrows with their 4 cyl Megatron turbo (formerly the BMW turbo), encountered problems with the pop-off valve during 1987 when it would often come in lower than the 4.0 bar limit thus giving less horsepower, McLaren got around this by generally setting their TAG's turbo limit at 3.6 bar in 1987. This also allowed McLaren the advantage of better fuel economy.\nEven today the MP4/3 is still considered to be one of the most powerful F1 cars ever made, since turbo boost pressure would be further reduced to 2.5 bar in 1988, reducing the power output of the turbo engines to around 650 bhp (480 kW) in a bid to make the naturally aspirated cars more competitive. Turbocharged engines were then banned completely in 1989, so the turbo era in Formula One may remain possibly the high-water mark for horsepower levels in Formula 1.\nThe MP4/3 was also the car with which Prost won the 1987 Portuguese Grand Prix to become the driver with the most wins in Formula One history beating Jackie Stewart's record of 27 wins which had stood since Stewart retired at the end of 1973.\nThe MP4/3 was the last McLaren Grand Prix car to use the TAG-Porsche engine. Its successor, the highly successful MP4/4, would be powered by the Honda V6 turbo.\n\nChassis log history\nFive new MP4/3 cars were moulded from carbon fibre with assistance from Hercules Aerospace, as since the creation of the all-new MP4/1 in 1981. The chassis numbers, 1 through 5, were used throughout the year, with three new cars ready for the first race in Brazil.Two MP4/3s were destroyed during 1987, but three complete MP4/3s still exist: Chassis #4 is on display at the Donington Museum, chassis #5 is still owned by McLaren, and chassis #1, the only one in private hands, belongs to a Porsche collector in the United States and was auctioned on 9 March 2012 at Amelia Island, FL by Gooding & Company.\n#1: Used as a spare car for every race except Österreichring. Stefan Johansson raced this chassis only once, at the aborted start (1st) at Österreichring.\n#2: Raced by Johansson at Rio, Imola, Spa, Monaco, Detroit, Paul Ricard, Silverstone, Hockenheim, and Hungaroring. The car was written off in practice at Österreichring by Johansson, after a deer struck the car, and crashed.\n#3: Raced by Alain Prost at Rio, Imola, Spa, Monaco, Detroit, and Paul Ricard. Car modified for Johansson for race use at Österreichring. It was originally a spare car at Mexico City, but then raced by Johansson, but written off in 1st-lap accident.\n#4: New car for Prost to race at Silverstone, Hockenheim, Hungaroring, Österreichring, Monza, Estoril, Jerez, Mexico City, Suzuka, and Adelaide.\n#5: New car for Johansson at Monza, Estoril, Jerez, Suzuka, and Adelaide.\nThe sixth car, known as the MP4/3B, was a test mule for the Honda turbo engine that would power McLaren's hopes for 1988. The MP4/3B never raced, but was tested by Prost, and later his 1988 teammate Ayrton Senna, until the all-new MP4/4 made its track debut at Imola a week before the start of the 1988 season (Prost lapped Imola over 2 seconds faster in the MP4/4 than he had in the MP4/3B. The MP4/4 would go on to be the most dominant single season car in F1 history, winning 15 of 1988's 16 races, as well as claiming pole in 15). After finishing the role, the sixth car went to Argentina and is on display at the Juan Manuel Fangio Museum in Balcarce.\n\nComplete Formula One results\n(key) (results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLev Ivanov\nLev Ivanovich Ivanov (Russian: Лев Ива́нович Ива́нов; 2 March 1834, Moscow – 24 December 1901, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer and later, Second Balletmaster of the Imperial Ballet. As a performer with the Imperial Ballet, he achieved prominence after performing as an understudy in a benefit performance of La Fille Mal Gardée.  He is most famous as the choreographer of Acts II and IV of Swan Lake, which include the Dance of the Little Swans, Act II of Cinderella, and The Nutcracker, which he choreographed alongside Marius Petipa.\n\nBiography\nIvanov entered the Moscow School of Dance, but in 1844 moved to Saint Petersburg where he studied at the Imperial Ballet, becoming an official member of the Corps de ballet in 1852.  Among his teachers during this time were Jean-Antoine Petipa, Alexandr Pimenov, Pierre Frédéric Malavergne and Emile Gredlu (Эмиль Гредлю).\nHistorically, Ivanov is credited with choreographing the entirety of premiere of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker in 1892 due to the ill health of the ballet master, Marius Petipa. While some contemporary and modern accounts dispute this, Ivanov is still mentioned in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition with choreographing at least the majority of the ballet as Petipa had reportedly not progressed very far in his work. Regardless of the amount of work he actually did, Petipa's was the only name listed for choreography on posters for the first production in St. Petersburg.Ivanov worked with Petipa on a new restaging of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet in 1895.  Ivanov choreographed the entirety of the lakeside acts or \"white acts\", Act II and Act IV.  This includes the Dance of the Little Swans, an iconic pas de quatre where the four cygnets huddle together and dance in unison, before breaking the chain and falling to the floor whilst attempting to fly. Ivanov also choreographed the Danse Vénitienne (Neapolitan/Venetian Dance) and the Pas Hongrois (Hungarian Dance) of the third bier scene.In his last years Ivanov was in financial straits. On the strength of his 50 years' service he petitioned the Imperial Theatres for financial assistance.\n\nBallets\nOriginal works\nLa Forêt enchantée (en. The Enchanted Forest).

The utility company remained a major subsidiary of the North American Company, until that conglomerate's 1940s breakup by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHistory\nClement Studebaker, Jr. (1871–1932) was born the son of Clement Studebaker (1831–1901), the carriage and automobile manufacturer of South Bend, Indiana.In 1911, the company founded by the Studebaker brothers joined forces with Everitt-Metzker-Flanders Company of Detroit to form the Studebaker Corporation. In one of his several executive positions, Clement Studebaker, Jr. served as Vice President of the E-M-F Company.By 1916 Clement Studebaker, Jr. had formed the publicly traded North American Light and Power Company, and issued stock, with certificates  printed by the American Banknote Company.Clement Studebaker, Jr. also served as President and Chairman of the Board of the Illinois Power and Light Company (and of its subsidiary, the Illinois Traction Company), the South Bend Watch Company, and as Treasurer of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad.\n\nNorth American Company\nNorth American Company had once been one of the original stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.North American Light and Power remained under the ownership of North American Company for the next decade after Clement's death, as a major subsidiary holding company of other lines. \nBy 1940, North American Company had become a US$2.3 billion holding company heading up a pyramid of by then 80 companies. It controlled ten major direct subsidiaries in eight of which it owned at least 79%. North American Light and Power Company was by then one of the three major holding companies among the ten direct subsidiaries.North American Company was broken up by the SEC, following the United States Supreme Court decision of April 1, 1946.\nPassage 2:\nSouthern Company\nSouthern Company is an American gas and electric utility holding company based in the southern United States.

Securities and Exchange Commission, 327 U.S. 686 (1946), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) directing a public utility holding company to divest its securities of all companies except for one electric company did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nBackground\nPUHCA was one of a number of trust-busting and securities regulation initiatives that were enacted in response to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression, including the collapse of Samuel Insull's public utility holding companies. By 1932, the eight largest utility holding companies controlled 73 percent of the investor-owned electric industry. Their complex, highly leveraged, corporate structures were very difficult for individual states to regulate. PUHCA required electric company holding companies to register with the SEC, and authorized the SEC to limit a holding company to a single integrated electric system through the divestiture of its other public utility and unrelated companies.\nThe North American Company, formed in 1890, was a holding company in a system that by 1940 contained 80 companies operating in seventeen states and the District of Columbia. These included the Union Electric Company, which operated an electric system around St. Louis, Missouri, and subsidiaries in Illinois and Iowa, the Washington Railway and Electric Company, and the North American Light and Power Company with systems in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa and its subsidiaries Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Detroit Edison Company. In addition, North American also owned an investment trust company and West Kentucky Coal Company. Together the various electric systems served more than 3,000,000 customers in a service territory of 165,000 square miles.\nNorth American initially challenged the constitutionality of PUHCA and requested an injunction against its enforcement, but the Supreme Court in Landis v. North American Co., held that the case was premature and that North American should register and then litigate the constitutionality of PUHCA after the SEC conducted its proceeding. North American then registered in 1937 as a holding company with the SEC, reserving its right to challenge the validity of the remaining portions of PUHCA. After initiating an administrative proceeding, the SEC issued an order requiring divestiture of North American's securities in companies other than the Union Electric Company. North American appealed, but in 1943 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the order. Arguing that ownership of securities was not interstate commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause and that the divestiture ordered by the SEC was a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, North American appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.\n\nOpinion\nThe opinion by Justice Murphy first concluded that North American was engaged in interstate commerce and through its substantial stock ownership dominated its subsidiaries. The opinion then noted that North American's argument that PUHCA's divestiture provision was invalid because ownership of securities was not commerce had been previously rejected by the Court in the anti-trust case of Northern Securities Co. v. United States. Under its authority under the Commerce Clause, Congress could regulate to protect the freedom of interstate commerce using any means that were lawful and not prohibited by the Constitution. Under Northern Securities, Congress could deal with and affect the ownership of securities to protect the freedom of commerce, which it did in fashioning the divestiture remedy in PUHCA.\nLastly, the Court dismissed the takings argument, noting that Congress had weighed the benefit to shareholders of efficient, common management of diversified companies against the actual and potential harm to the public, investors, and consumers from the use of pooled investments, and determined that the economic advantages of a holding company atop an unintegrated, sprawling electric system were not commensurate with the resulting economic disadvantages. In addition, it was not clear that there would be a loss necessary for a takings claim under the Fifth Amendment. PUHCA does not require the dumping or forced liquidation of the securities on the market for cash, so the stock of the companies ordered divested could be distributed to the shareholders or sold under a plan that protects shareholder rights. The Court determined that it could not conclude that North American shareholders were disadvantaged by the operation of the divestiture provision of PUHCA.\nJustices Reed, Douglas and Jackson did not participate in the consideration of the case. Although Chief Justice Stone had initially recused himself for a disclosed reason, but when he discovered that his disqualification plus those of the other justices would result in the lack of a quorum, he reversed his position.\n\nSubsequent events\nPUHCA was repealed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 effective February 8, 2006.\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 327\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004 film)\nAround the World in 80 Days is a 2004 American action adventure comedy film based on Jules Verne's 1873 novel of the same name and remake of the movie of the same name of 1956. It stars Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan and Cécile de France. The film is set in the nineteenth century and centers on Phileas Fogg (Coogan), here reimagined as an eccentric inventor, and his efforts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. During the trip, he is accompanied by his Chinese valet, Passepartout (Chan). For comedic reasons, the film intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of anachronistic elements. With production costs of about $110 million and estimated marketing costs of $30 million, it earned $24 million at the U.S. box office and $48 million worldwide, making it a box office failure. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, mainly for lacking similarities of the original book.\n\nPlot\nLau Xing robs the Bank of England and hides in Phileas Fogg's house, giving his name as \"Passport...too\". Fogg hears \"Passepartout\" and hires him as valet. He helps Fogg break the 50-mile-per-hour (80 km/h) speed barrier. \nAt the Royal Academy of Science, Fogg is insulted by Baron Kelvin. He bets that he can travel around the world in 80 days. If Fogg wins, he will replace Kelvin as Minister of Science. If not, he will be ruined. Fogg and Passepartout take a carriage out of London after a confrontation with corrupt Inspector Fix, hired by Kelvin.\nPassepartout and Fogg journey to Paris, where Passepartout must evade General Fang's warriors. Fang wants the jade Buddha previously given to Lord Kelvin but stolen by Passepartout. Pretending to take Fogg to see Thomas Edison, Passepartout leads him to impressionist painting student Monique La Roche. Passepartout fights the warriors while his boss discusses impressionism. The two men and Monique depart in a hot-air balloon, chased by Fang's warriors.\nThe trio continue their journey by train. However, in Istanbul, they are forced to become guests of Prince Hapi's banquet. Whilst initially hospitable, he soon orders the men to leave while Monique must become his seventh wife. The men convince Hapi to release Monique or they will damage his personal statue of \"The Thinker\", which is accidentally smashed. With Hapi in pursuit, the three travelers then escape.\nKelvin learns about the bank robbery. He orders the British-colonial authorities in India to arrest both men. Passepartout sees notice of the price on his head and warns his companions. Disguised as women they are attacked by Fang's warriors. Using Inspector Fix and a sextant as weapons, Fogg and Passepartout defeat their assailants and flee to China.\nIn a Chinese village where Lau Xing had came from, Lanzhou, they are welcomed by Lau's family members. However, they are captured by the Black Scorpions. Recognized, Lau Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight. At first, he fights alone and is defeated; moments later, he is joined by his fellow \"Ten Tigers of Canton\" to defeat the Black Scorpions. The jade Buddha is returned to the village temple.\nFogg desires to continue alone, disappointed and feeling used by his companions after finding out that through a picture of Lau and his family members in the village. He travels to San Francisco and is tricked out of his money. He is found destitute by Lau Xing and Monique who have followed him. In the Western desert, they find the Wright brothers who discuss their prototype flying machine. Fogg suggests a few changes, which are eagerly taken.\nIn New York City, a jubilant crowd prevents them from their ship. A policeman leads them to an ambush in a workshop. The three friends fight Fang and her warriors and win. Though Fogg could have gotten to the boat, he misses it to help Lau Xing. Fogg feels that he has lost, but the other two say that they may still make it if they catch the next ship.\nThey board an old ship and Fogg builds a plane out of the ship's old wood, promising a new ship to the captain. The ship's crew builds a catapult to launch it. The three fly to London and crash-land at the Royal Academy. Kelvin sends police to hinder them, and the clock strikes noon, ending the wager.\nKelvin proclaims himself the victor. Monique, Fix and other ministers attest to Kelvin's unfair methods. Kelvin insults Queen Victoria who overhears the insult which leads to Kelvin's arrest. She then reveals that she has bet money on Fogg winning and congratulates him for making it back a day early. \nThough Lau and Monique are confused, Fogg eventually realizes that they forgot to take the International Date Line into account: they themselves experienced 80 days, but London only experienced 79 days. He ascends the stairs of the academy and kisses Monique, victorious in his bet.\n\nCast\nJohnny Knoxville was initially cast as San Francisco Hobo.\n\nProduction\nWarner Bros., who owned the rights to the 1956 adaptation, planned their own remake with Stephen Sommers directing and Brendan Fraser starring, after the success of The Mummy. Stan Chervin wrote the script for this utilization of the film. Around the same time, 20th Century Fox and Good Machine were developing their own version with Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner writing the screenplay. Ang Lee and Stephen Herek were considered to direct.When Frank Coraci got involved, he went back to read the original novel and watch the 1956 film, where he realized that the story didn't really have a driving lead character. So he decided to rework the plot considerably, which involved giving Phileas Fogg an arc. Coraci's first choice for Fogg was Johnny Depp, but studio executives at the time didn't think Depp in a family movie would ever work (this was before the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl). Jackie Chan was announced to play Passepartout in June 2002. He was paid about $18 million for the role. After Chan was cast, the filmmakers settled on lesser known character actor Steve Coogan for Fogg. Walden Media was in charge of investing the film while Summit Entertainment handled foreign sales. Paramount Pictures acquired domestic distribution rights, and set a release date for November 21, 2003. However, the studio stepped out at the start of the year, with concerns over the high budget and bankability of the cast.Principal photography began on March 13, 2003, in Thailand, followed by a 3-Express\nPalin finds that the ship had indeed sailed from Singapore. However, quite fortunately, it was only four miles from shore and Palin was able to make it on board using a fast motorboat. While in Hong Kong, he has a big win betting on a horse race, is attacked by a cockatoo and meets up with his friend, photographer Basil Pao. He attends a party thrown in his honour at the halfway point (in terms of days) in the journey. Then it is on to Guangzhou for a dinner of shredded cobra and then a train journey to Shanghai. On the train, he is asked by a Chinese businesswoman if he carries an umbrella all the time. Palin replied, \"I just get wet.\" He also collects the roofing tile requested by Terry Gilliam from a very old railway station.\nSections:\n\nOriental Express\nWelcome to Hong Kong\nLocal Life\nThe Hong Kong Riviera\n\"China, here we come\"\nA Snake Supper\nThe Train to Shanghai\nA Four Seasons Climate\n\nFar East and Farther East\nIn Shanghai, Palin gets some herbal remedies to help him on the rest of his trip. He and Basil Pao take in a Chinese jazz band. After parting with Pao the next day, Palin takes a Chinese ferry to Yokohama, where he rides the world-famous shinkansen train to Tokyo. Here he meets David Powers, a British journalist, and is taken to a sushi bar and then a karaoke bar, where he sings a duet of \"You Are My Sunshine\". After spending the night in a capsule hotel, he boards a container ship to cross the Pacific Ocean. The journey takes eleven days and is very dull, enlivened only by a game of pass the parcel with the Singaporean crew, and the crossing of the International Date Line.  Palin partakes in an unusual ceremony to commemorate crossing the line, involving getting doused in tomato paste and flour, and drinking a strange cocktail containing many ingredients, among others, \"eggs, curry powder, cocoa...\". Palin suggests that some people involved in the ceremony had watched Full Metal Jacket to prepare for it.\nSections:\n\nFar East and Farther East\nTime to Move On\nJapan\nKaraoke\nThe Neptune Garnet\nWorsening Weather\nShip-Lag\nHalfway Round the World\n\nDateline to Deadline\nArriving in Long Beach, California only two days behind Fogg, Palin spends his first night in America aboard the permanently berthed Queen Mary. After a few days, he boards Amtrak's Desert Wind in Los Angeles and travels to Glenwood Springs, Colorado in the Rocky Mountains. He takes a hot-air balloon ride and a dog sled trip in Aspen, Colorado. After a nerve-wracking delay he realises he probably should have stayed on the Chicago-bound train. Eventually arriving in New York City (Palin was actually supposed to depart North America from Nova Scotia, Canada, as he mentions earlier in the film, but the reason for the substitution for New York is not mentioned in either the film or the book, although the delay due to the stopover in Colorado is a probable cause). However, in the first episode it is mentioned that departure from either New York City or Nova Scotia would be where the final leg of the journey would take place. He boards the final ship of his journey dead even with Phileas Fogg on day 71. This container ship takes eight days to cross the Atlantic Ocean, and after a quick lunch in Le Havre, Palin arrives in Felixstowe, touching Great Britain for the first time in two and a half months. A few train connections later he arrives at his starting point, the Reform Club in London, but is not allowed in to film, but Palin does get a warm welcome at the BBC with his referees. The journey ends 79 days and 7 hours after it began. The closing credits show Palin chatting with his referees at the BBC offices as he presents the souvenirs requested by them at the beginning to ceremonially prove his accomplishment.\n\nSections:\n\nDateline to Deadline\nAmerica by Train\nGlenwood Springs\nBehind Schedule Again\nNew York Bound\nNine Days Left\nFelixstowe\nThe End in Sight\n\nProduction\nThe journey around the world lasted from 25 September to 12 December 1988. Palin travelled through the following countries by foot, train, ship, balloon, and husky dog, amongst other methods of transport (except for aircraft): United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Japan, and the United States.\nOnly four members of Palin's film crew completed the circumnavigation: Clem Vallance, Roger Mills (the directors), Angela Elbourne, and Ann Holland (the production assistants). The three others who started with him left when they got to Hong Kong, and were replaced by others. Strictly speaking, it was only Palin who obeyed the rules of the journey, as the production team was not allowed on the road trip across Saudi Arabia and Qatar (Palin and Clem Vallance did this stretch) or on the Croatian ship (Palin and Nigel Meakin did this stretch). The remainder of the team flew on these stretches. During the Jeddah to Dubai episode, Palin managed to snap a few pictures which are seen in the documentary.\nWhile preparing for the journey, Palin had a chat with renowned documentarist Alan Whicker. In the book and an interview on the DVD, Palin mentions that Whicker had been the BBC's first choice of presenter, but he and two others (Miles Kington and Noel Edmonds) had declined; Palin was fourth on the BBC's list.\n\nAround the World in 20 Years\nOn 30 December 2008, the BBC aired a special one-hour documentary entitled Around the World in 20 Years. In it, Palin goes in search of the crew of the Al Shama, the dhow which carried him from Dubai to Bombay (now Mumbai) some 20 years ago. After an extensive search involving the shipping company that owned Al Shama, Palin tracks them to the city of Mandvi in Gujarat. There, Palin finds the captain of Al Shama himself, along with five other members of the crew. Two of the original crew members had died in the intervening years, one of them being the older man whom Palin had let listen to Bruce Springsteen on his Walkman. Palin also discovers that the Al Shama had sunk in the Indian Ocean while being towed for repairs years before. The production crew are the same people as on 80 Days.\n\nSee also\nTelevision portal\n World portal\nPassage 8:\nSummer Magic\nSummer Magic may refer to:\n\nSummer Magic (film), a 1963 Walt Disney Productions family musical film\nSummer Magic (EP), an EP by Red Velvet\nSummer Magic (song), a song by Ai\nSummer Magic, a 1994 set of Magic: The Gathering cards\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRabi cycle\nIn physics, the Rabi cycle (or Rabi flop) is the cyclic behaviour of a two-level quantum system in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. A great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two-level quantum mechanical systems, and exhibit Rabi flopping when coupled to an optical driving field. The effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance and quantum computing, and is named after Isidor Isaac Rabi.\nA two-level system is one that has two possible energy levels. These two levels are a ground state with lower energy and an excited state with higher energy. If the energy levels are not degenerate (i.e. not having equal energies), the system can absorb a quantum of energy and transition from the ground state to the \"excited\" state. When an atom (or some other two-level system) is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons, it will cyclically absorb photons and re-emit them by stimulated emission. One such cycle is called a Rabi cycle, and the inverse of its duration is the Rabi frequency of the photon beam. The effect can be modeled using the Jaynes–Cummings model and the Bloch vector formalism.\n\nMathematical description\nA detailed mathematical description of the effect can be found on the page for the Rabi problem. For example, for a two-state atom (an atom in which an electron can either be in the excited or ground state) in an electromagnetic field with frequency tuned to the excitation energy, the probability of finding the atom in the excited state is found from the Bloch equations to be\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ∝\n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        (\n        ω\n        t\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |c_{b}(t)|^{2}\\propto \\sin ^{2}(\\omega t/2),}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n   is the Rabi frequency.\nMore generally, one can consider a system where the two levels under consideration are not energy eigenstates. Therefore, if the system is initialized in one of these levels, time evolution will make the population of each of the levels oscillate with some characteristic frequency, whose angular frequency is also known as the Rabi frequency. The state of a two-state quantum system can be represented as vectors of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space, which means that every state vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle }\n   is represented by complex coordinates:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    c\n                    \n                      1\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    c\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle ={\\begin{pmatrix}c_{1}\\\\c_{2}\\end{pmatrix}}=c_{1}{\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}}+c_{2}{\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}},}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{1}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{2}}\n   are the coordinates.If the vectors are normalized, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{1}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{2}}\n   are related by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |c_{1}|^{2}+|c_{2}|^{2}=1}\n  .

Rabi saw science as a way of inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.\n\nMilitary matters\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that created the Atomic Energy Commission provided for a nine-man General Advisory Committee (GAC) to advise the Commission on scientific and technical matters. Rabi was one of those appointed in December 1946. The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but in 1950 the GAC unanimously opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. Rabi went further than most of the other members, and joined Fermi in opposing the hydrogen bomb on moral as well as technical grounds. However, President Harry S. Truman overrode the GAC's advice, and ordered development to proceed. Rabi later said:\n\nI never forgave Truman for buckling under the pressure. He simply did not understand what it was about. As a matter of fact, after he stopped being President he still didn't believe that the Russians had a bomb in 1949. He said so. So for him to have alerted the world that we were going to make a hydrogen bomb at a time when we didn't even know how to make one was one of the worst things he could have done. It shows the dangers of this sort of thing.\nOppenheimer was not reappointed to the GAC when his term expired in 1952, and Rabi succeeded him as chairman, serving until 1956. Rabi later testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Atomic Energy Commission's controversial security hearing in 1954 that led to Oppenheimer being stripped of his security clearance. Many witnesses supported Oppenheimer, but none more forcefully than Rabi:\n\nSo it didn't seem to me the sort of thing that called for this kind of proceeding... against a man who has accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has accomplished. There is a real positive record... We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it, and we have a whole series of super bombs, and what more do you want, mermaids?\nRabi was appointed a member of the Science Advisory Committee (SAC) of the Office of Defense Mobilization in 1952, serving as its chairman from 1956 to 1957. This coincided with the Sputnik crisis. President Dwight Eisenhower met with the SAC on October 15, 1957, to seek advice on possible US responses to the Soviet satellite success. Rabi, who knew Eisenhower from the latter's time as president of Columbia, was the first to speak, and put forward a series of proposals, one of which was to strengthen the committee so it could provide the President with timely advice. This was done, and the SAC became the President's Science Advisory Committee a few weeks later. He also became Eisenhower's Science Advisor. In 1956 Rabi attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. He served as the US Representative to the NATO Science Committee at the time that the term \"software engineering\" was coined. While serving in that capacity, he bemoaned the fact that many large software projects were delayed. This prompted discussions that led to the formation of a study group that organized the first conference on software engineering.\n\nHonors\nIn the course of his life, Rabi received many honors in addition to the Nobel Prize. These included the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1942, the Medal for Merit and the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom from Great Britain in 1948, the officer in the French Legion of Honour in 1956, Columbia University's Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1960, the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the Atoms for Peace Award in 1967, the Oersted Medal from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1982, the Four Freedoms Award from the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute and the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1985, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the Vannevar Bush Award from the National Science Foundation in 1986. He was a Fellow (elected 1931) of the American Physical Society, serving as its president in 1950, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was internationally recognized with membership in the Japan Academy and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and in 1959 was appointed a member of the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The most valuable of Columbia University's undergraduate research scholarships, designed to motivate and support promising young scientists, is named after him, so is the street, Route Rabi at CERN, on the Prévessin site in France.\n\nDeath\nRabi died at his home on Riverside Drive in Manhattan from cancer on January 11, 1988. His wife, Helen, survived him and died at the age of 102 on June 18, 2005. In his last days, he was reminded of his greatest achievement when his physicians examined him using magnetic resonance imaging, a technology that had been developed from his ground-breaking research on magnetic resonance. The machine happened to have a reflective inner surface, and he remarked: \"I saw myself in that machine... I never thought my work would come to this.\"\n\nBooks\nRabi, Isidor Isaac (1960).

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSanta's Workshop (Colorado)\nSanta's Workshop is an amusement park that opened on June 16, 1956 in Cascade, Colorado, located on U.S. Route 24 just west of Colorado Springs at the entrance to the Pikes Peak Highway, at the Northern end of Pikes Peak. Modeled after the Santa's Workshop in Wilmington, New York, the park features a charming North Pole village complete with a variety of shops selling toys, candy, and Christmas decorations. The village is also home to Santa's Workshop itself, where children (and adults) can meet with Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus year round. Much of the staff is dressed in Christmas themed attire, especially those at work in stores and admissions.\nIn addition to the village, Santa's Workshop is a fully operational amusement park best suited for children ages 2 to 12. It is home to 28 rides, many of which are classified specifically as \"kiddie\" rides. Family highlights include a small roller coaster, the highest altitude Ferris wheel in North America, a Giant Slide (Helter skelter), as well as a North Pole made of permanent ice in the center of the park.  Attractions also include a Tilt-A-Whirl, a Scrambler, a chairlift, a narrow gauge railroad, a magic show, and an arcade. In 2014, Santa's Sleigh, a 30 mph, 2-person zip line was added.\nThe park is generally open from mid-May through Christmas Eve, and is closed from January to May. As of 2018, admission is $24.00 per person for ages 3–59. Under 3 and 60 or older are free. Military and group rates are available. The park is still owned and operated by the Haggard family who opened it in 1956.\n\nExternal links\nSanta's Workshop (Colorado amusement park) at the Roller Coaster DataBase\nPassage 2:\nLarry Wilson (screenwriter)\nLarry Wilson (born January 23, 1948) is an American film producer and screenwriter. He is best known for his screenwriting work on the films Beetlejuice (1988) and The Addams Family (1991). He also co-wrote the films The Little Vampire (2000) and, for television, The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006). He wrote and directed a number of episodes of the Tales from the Crypt television series from 1991 to 1996.\nPassage 3:\nRankin/Bass Productions\nRankin/Bass Animated Entertainment (founded and formerly known as Videocraft International, Ltd. and Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.) was an American production company located in New York City, and known for its seasonal television specials, usually done in stop motion animation. Rankin/Bass' stop-motion productions are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called \"Animagic\".\nNearly all of the studio's animation was outsourced to Japanese animation companies such as Toei Doga Entertainment, MOM Production, Mushi Productions and Topcraft. Rankin/Bass was one of the first western studios to outsource their low-budget animated television and film productions to animation studios in foreign countries; the others that already practiced animation outsourcing includes Total Television and King Features Syndicate TV in New York City; and Jay Ward Productions and Hanna-Barbera Productions in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in New York City by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass on September 14, 1960, as Videocraft International, Ltd. The majority of Rankin/Bass' work, including all of their \"Animagic\" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in Tokyo, Japan. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator Tadahito Mochinaga at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as \"Tad Mochinaga\".\nRankin/Bass' traditional animation output was done by several animation studios such as Toei Animation, Eiken (formerly known as TCJ, short for the Television Corporation of Japan), Mushi Production, and especially Topcraft, which was formed on February 1, 1972 by Toei animator Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass' specials). While several of Topcraft's staff, including Hara and industry legends such as Hayao Miyazaki, would go on to form Studio Ghibli in the wake of Topcraft's death, others formed another studio: Pacific Animation Corporation, which continued working on Rankin/Bass' titles until the latter company shut down.\nIn addition to the \"name\" talent that provided the narration for the specials, Rankin/Bass had its own company of voice actors. For the studio's early work, this group was based in Toronto, Ontario where recording was supervised by veteran CBC announcer Bernard Cowan. The Canadian group included actors such as Paul Soles, Larry D. Mann, and Carl Banas.\nMaury Laws served as musical director for almost all of the animated films and television programs. Romeo Muller was another consistent contributor, serving as screenwriter for many of Rankin/Bass' best-known productions including Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), The Little Drummer Boy (1968), and Frosty the Snowman (1969).\n\nOutput\nOne of Videocraft's first projects was an independently produced television series in 1960, The New Adventures of Pinocchio, based on the Italian author Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio and featuring \"Animagic\", a stop motion animation process using figurines or puppets (a process already pioneered by George Pal's \"Puppetoons\" and Art Clokey's Gumby and Davey and Goliath), managed by Mochinaga and his MOM Production staffers for Videocraft with Dentsu. This was followed by another independently produced series in 1961, Tales of the Wizard of Oz, Videocraft's adaptation of the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, as well as their first production to use traditional cel animation. Unlike many of Rankin/Bass' works, Tales of the Wizard of Oz was animated by Crawley Films in Ottawa, headed by F. R. Crawley.\n\nRudolph era\nOne of the mainstays of the business was holiday-themed animated specials for airing on American television. In 1964, the company produced a special for NBC and sponsor General Electric, later owner of NBC. It was a stop motion animated adaptation of Robert L. May's 1939 story \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and the 19to poison any child unlucky enough to chance upon it. This hate-filled stocking stuffer has nothing but contempt for its intended audience, promoting the worst possible beliefs about people, while cloaking itself, incredibly, in the fake guise of a meaningful lesson about the holidays: the gall that the cretinous makers of this film have is really quite audacious.”\n\nCast\nJohn Goodman as Santa Claus\nDelta Burke as Mrs. Claus\nMichael McKean as Snow Miser\nHarvey Fierstein as Heat Miser\nEthan Suplee as Jingle Bells\nEddie Griffin as Jangle Bells\nChris Kattan as Sparky\nDylan Minnette as Ignatius \"Iggy\" Thistlewhite\nBilly Slaughter as Nerd ElfCarol Kane as Mother Nature\nCarson Kressley as the elf costumer\nLaura Schlessinger, \"Dr. Laura\", as herself\nJack LaLanne as Hercules\n\nSequel\nA sequel, titled A Miser Brothers' Christmas, was produced in 2008 by Warner Bros.

Distributed by Warner Bros. Animation under their Warner Premiere label (the rights holders of the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios, the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday, December 13, 2008, during the network's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming.Mickey Rooney (at age 88) and George S. Irving (at age 86) reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser. Snow Miser (originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987) was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus (voiced in the original by Shirley Booth who died in 1992) was portrayed by Catherine Disher. The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style. This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016.\n\nPlot\nThe feuding Miser Brothers (Heat and Snow) attend their family reunion with Mother Nature and their fellow siblings including the North Wind, Earthquake, Thunder and Lightning, and the Tides. North Wind passively asks Mother Nature what might happen if Santa would be unable to complete his duties on Christmas. She responds that North Wind would take control instead. Heat then begins to call out Snow for trying to \"give global warming a bad name\". Snow responds by talking about Heat's attempts to scare people with reports of a second Ice Age. Heat then reprimands Snow for claiming Iceland as his own, which barely has any ice. Snow then calls out Heat for claiming Greenland as his own because it's full of ice. The brothers then fight each other. Mother Nature ends the fight.\nDespite his dashing appearance and veneer of flattery and devotion toward Mother Nature, the North Wind is far more malevolent than either of his brothers. Self-absorbed and vain, the North Wind is fixated with the idea of replacing Santa Claus as a way to achieve personal glory. Beginning his machinations, He then sends two of his minions to crash Santa's Super-Sleigh designed by his mechanic Tinsel, causing Santa to injure his back after falling in the middle of a fight between the brothers as he unintentionally crosses into their domain.\nDespite what she told the North Wind before and having been informed by Mrs. Claus about what happened to Santa, Mother Nature assigns the Miser Brothers the responsibility of running the toy factory. Their fighting continues as they move through several workshop stations. The North Wind hatches a new plan to keep them fighting so it would appear as if they ruined Christmas themselves, but Mrs. Claus convinces the Miser Brothers to put aside their differences and cooperate by showing them the Naughty/Nice list station. The brothers' history is revealed, showing they've always been on Santa's naughty list for mutual bickering. Upon learning the error of their ways, they begin working together and successfully get work back up to speed. However, the North Wind hatches a plan to destroy their truce and get them fighting again, leaving Santa to deliver the toys and giving North Wind the chance to finish him off.\nOn Christmas Eve, the North Wind's minions surreptitiously attach heating and cooling units to the sleigh, apparently capable of heating or cooling entire regions of the planet. The discovery causes the Miser Brothers to blame each other. With them fighting again, Santa has no choice but to drive the sleigh as North Wind planned. After Santa leaves, Tinsel discovers the super-sleigh has been sabotaged, which stops the Misers' fight as they realize that neither of them was responsible for injuring Santa. Upon finding one of North Wind's Christmas cards with him dressed as Santa, the Misers realize the truth about their brother and comprehend his plan. Meanwhile, the North Wind attacks Santa's sleigh in flight, whipping up a vortex to consume Santa, but the Miser Brothers, with the aid of Tinsel and a team of young reindeer, save Santa in the nick of time.\nThe North Wind's cover is blown and Mother Nature sentences him to do household chores for the next several thousand years as punishment for trying to finish off Santa and making his brothers fight. With North Wind thwarted, the brothers learn they've finally made the nice list. They deliver the presents for Santa and give gifts to each other in the process, making peace between them and ending their feud.\n\nCast\nMickey Rooney as Santa Claus\nGeorge S.

The VDC is just 80 km (approx.) from Kathmandu, the capital city. \"Nohak Gupha (Nohak Cave)\" also lies within the VDC which can be one of the longest cave in the country though it is yet to be publicized and verified. Canyoning in also a major attraction for local and foreign tourist in the VDC.\nPassage 2:\nOld Bazaar, Gjakova\nThe Old Bazaar (Albanian: Pazari i vjetër; Serbian: Стари базар / Stari bazar) in Gjakova is the oldest bazaar in Kosovo (also known as Çarshia e Madhe (Grand Bazaar) or Dakovica. Mëhalla e Hadumit, the historical neighborhood where it is located also houses the city's oldest mosque, the Hadum Mosque (Xhamia e Hadumit), which dates from the 15th century.\nThe Grand Bazaar (from the Turkish: Çarşı meaning marketplace Albanian: Çarshia e Vjetër) was the heart of the economy in Gjakova, a city of trade and merchandise which served the villages around the municipality of Gjakova, the Junik zone and Gjakova’s highlands (Malësia e Gjakovës) on the border between Kosovo and Albania. The Old Bazaar was burnt and destroyed and then it was reconstructed after suffering damage during the 1999 war (the last war in Kosovo).\nAround the mosque lie the graves with sculpted decorations, with inscriptions engraved in the old Ottoman language. In the past, it was used to bury members of the popular families in Gjakova. Within the mosque’s complex were the hamam (Turkish bath) which was destroyed in 2008, the building of the old library, from 1671 (burnt by Serbian forces during the war of 1999 and totally ruined in 2000) and also meytepi from 1777.\nThe bazaar is linked to the city centre, just five minutes away via the IslamBegu Bridge. The bazaar covers an area of about  35,000 m2 (380,000 sq ft) and the length of its main road is 1 km, with about 500 shops situated along it. It is, however, still home to an active mosque, several türbes, and a clock tower, which was destroyed during the First Balkan War and was recently rebuilt.\n\nHistory\nGrand Bazaar of Gjakova arose with the appearance of the first craftsmen and the artisan processing produce; it arose then when Gjakova obtained the kasaba (small town) status, when in 1003 H (1594/95), Selman Hadim Aga donated some public facilities, which he had built himself to religious institutions the Hadum Mosque, a meytep (elementary religious school), a library, a muvakit-hane, “a building for measuring the time and determining the calendar by means of astrolabic quadrates\", a public bath (hamam), an inn and some shops. For the maintenance of these facilities he asked from sultan to attach to his “vakif” some lands of sultan properties (hases), whose income should be used for the maintenance of the mentioned buildings and for the payment of the staff that would work there.\nHowever, the first direct facts about the Grand Bazaar were provided by the Turk traveloguer Evlia Çelebi, who visited Gjakova in 1662 and, it seems, was amazed by the beauty and treasure of the city and of Gjakovar citizens. Among other things, he wrote: “Jakova has two thousand decorated houses located in a vast field. It has two beautiful mosques, mosques without a minaret (“mesjide”), inns covered in lead. It has a beautiful public bath (hamam) that pleases your heart and about three hundred shops with one thousand kinds of crafts. Referring to the impressions the Gjakovars left on him, he continues \"Since it has a lovely climate, the inhabitants are good looking and kind\".\nAs it can be seen from the beginnings, there was a great number of shops in the Grand Bazaar, in which almost all kinds of trades were developed aiming at fulfilling all the needs of the population of the region of Gjakova and of export such as those of metal processors, leather processors, textile processors, tinsmiths, saddlers, (shag-makers) white woolen cap-makers, rug-makers etc.\nThe metal processing included some very important trades for that time, such as gunsmiths, silversmith, copper dishes productions, tinsmith etc. In the 18th century the famous gun master Tush the gunsmith was mentioned in Gjakova, who dealt not only with their producing, but also with their decoration. As a master of luxurious guns producing, which at that time were requested without any distinction by all the social classes, he managed to create, in this century, “the people's school\" of this trade, known until today by his name.\n\nHadum Mosque\nA shepherd from the Guskë village was looking after his sheep and goats. The Turkish (Ottoman) guardsof produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.\n\nIn art and literature – Orientalism\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the Orient. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilization; the peoples could be threatening- they were \"despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.\" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.\n\nSubject-matter\nMany of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade. Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks. For example, Charles D'Oyly, who was born in India, published the Antiquities of Dacca featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. European society generally frowned on nude painting – but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.\n\nNotable Orientalist artists\nNotable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830-1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-Étienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India. Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830–1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853–1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.\n\nOrientalist literature\nA proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of The Arabian Nights (translated into English from the French in 1705–08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's Oriental Tales, is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle's Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas published in 1922\n\nGallery of paintings, drawings, and watercolours\nSelected illustrations of bazaar scenes\n\nGallery of photographs\nList of bazaars and souks\nSee also\nList of Orientalist artistsTypes of markets, bazaars and souksBazaari\nBedesten (also known as bezistan, bezisten, bedesten) refers to a covered bazaar and an open bazaar in the Balkans.\nHaat bazaar – (also known as a hat) an open air bazaar or market in South Asia.\nLanda bazaar – a terminal market or market for second hand goods (South Asia), such as Medina quarter.\nMeena Bazaar – a bazaar that raises money for non-profit organisations.\nPasar malam – a night market in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore that opens in the evening, typically held in the street in residential neighbourhoods.\nPasar pagi – a morning market, typically a wet market that trades from dawn until midday, found in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nTommie Smith\nTommie C. Smith (born June 6, 1944) is an American former track and field athlete and former wide receiver in the American Football League. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Smith, aged 24, won the 200-meter sprint finals and gold medal in 19.83 seconds – the first time the 20-second barrier was broken officially. His Black Power salute with John Carlos atop the medal podium to protest racism and injustice against African Americans in the United States caused controversy, as it was seen as politicizing the Olympic Games. It remains a symbolic moment in the history of the Black Power movement.\n\nEarly life and career\nTommie Smith was born on June 6, 1944, in Clarksville, Texas, the seventh of twelve children born to Richard and Dora Smith. He suffered from pneumonia as a child, but still grew to be an athletic youth. While attending Lemoore High School in Lemoore, California, Smith showed great potential, setting most of the school's track records, many of which remain. He won the 440-yard dash in the 1963 CIF California State Meet. He was voted Lemoore's \"Most Valuable Athlete\" in basketball, football, and track and field, and was also voted vice president of his senior class. His achievements earned him a scholarship to San José State University.On May 7, 1966, while he was at San Jose State, Smith set a world best of 19.5 seconds in the 200m straight, which he ran on a cinder track. That record for 200m was finally beaten by Tyson Gay on May 16, 2010, just over 44 years later, though Smith still holds the record for the slightly longer 220-yard event. Since the IAAF has abandoned ratifying records for the event, Smith still retains the official record for the straightaway 200m/220 yards in perpetuity.A few weeks later, on June 11, 1966, Smith set the record for 200 meters and 220 yards around a turn at 20.0, the first man to do that in 20 seconds. Six days later he won the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship. Smith also won the national collegiate 220-yard (201.17 m) title in 1967 before adding the AAU furlong (201.17m) crown as well. He traveled to Japan for the 1967 Summer Universiade and won the 200m gold medal. He repeated as U.S. 200m champion in 1968 and made the Olympic team.\n\n1968 Summer Olympics\nLeading up to the Olympics, at the U.S. Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, California, San Jose State teammate John Carlos beat Smith and his world record, running 19.92A. John Carlos' record was disallowed because of the brush spike shoes he was wearing, as was a similar record by Vince Matthews in the 400 meters.As a member of the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR) Smith originally advocated a boycott of the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games unless four conditions were met: South Africa and Rhodesia uninvited from the Olympics, the restoration of Muhammad Ali's world heavyweight boxing title, Avery Brundage to step down as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the hiring of more African-American assistant coaches. As the boycott failed to achieve support after the IOC withdrew invitations for South Africa and Rhodesia, he decided, together with Carlos, to not only wear their gloves but also go barefoot to protest poverty, wear beads to protest lynchings, and wear buttons that said OPHR.At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico, Smith nursed an injured groin into the 200m final. In the race, teammate Carlos powered out to the lead through the turn, while Smith got a slow start. Coming off the turn, Smith charged past Carlos and sped to victory.  Knowing he had passed his training partner and closest opponent, his victory was so clear, he raised his arms to celebrate 10m before the finish line. Still, he improved upon his own world record that would last for 11 years until Pietro Mennea would surpass it on the same track. Smith's time of 19.83 was among the first automatically timed world records for the event as recorded by the IAAF.\n\nCarlos and Smith made headlines around the world by raising their black-gloved fists at the medal award ceremony. Both athletes wore black socks and no shoes on the podium to represent African-American poverty in the United States. In support, Peter Norman, the silver medalist who was a white athlete from Australia, participated in the protest by wearing an OPHR badge.IOC president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were \"a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit.\" Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against Nazi salutes during the Berlin Olympics. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes' salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.Smith and Carlos faced consequences for challenging white authority in the U.S. Ralph Boston, a black U.S. long jumper at the 1968 games, stated: \"The rest of the world didn't seem to find it such a derogatory thing. They thought it was very positive. Only America thought it was bad.\" The men's gesture had lingering effects for all three athletes, the most serious of which were death threats against Smith, Carlos and their families. Following their suspension by the IOC, they faced economic hardship.Smith stated in later years that \"We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how Muhammad Ali got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges.\"\n\nAthletics and later career\nDuring his career, Smith set seven individual world records and also was a member of several world-record relay teams at San Jose State, where he was coached by Lloyd (Bud) Winter. With personal records of 10.1 for 100 meters, 19.83 for 200 and 44.5 for the 400, Smith still ranks high on the world all-time lists.\nSmith, who had been drafted by the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams in the ninth round of the 1967 NFL Draft, signed to play for the American Football League's Cincinnati Bengals and was part-African holiday. Karenga said his goal was to \"give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.\"Kwanzaa is inspired by African \"first fruit\" traditions, and the name chosen is from Swahili, \"matunda ya kwanza.\" The rituals of the holiday promote African traditions and Nguzo Saba, the \"seven principles of African Heritage\" that Karenga described as \"a communitarian African philosophy\":\n\nUmoja (unity)—To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.\nKujichagulia (self-determination)—To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.\nUjima (collective work and responsibility)—To build and maintain our community together and make our brother's and sister's problems our problems and to solve them together.\nUjamaa (cooperative economics)—To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.\nNia (purpose)—To make our collective vocation the building and development of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.\nKuumba (creativity)—To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.\nImani (faith)—To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.\n\nCriminal conviction and imprisonment\nIn 1971, Karenga was sentenced to one to ten years in prison on counts of felony assault and false imprisonment. One of the victims gave testimony of how Karenga and other men tortured her and another woman. The woman described having been stripped naked and beaten with an electrical cord. Karenga's estranged wife, Brenda Lorraine Karenga, testified that she sat on the other woman's stomach while another man forced water into her mouth through a hose.\nA May 14, 1971, article in the Los Angeles Times described the testimony of one of the women:\n\nDeborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis' mouth and placed against Miss Davis' face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters.\nJones and Brenda Karenga testified that Karenga believed the women were conspiring to poison him, which Davis has attributed to a combination of ongoing police pressure and his own drug abuse.Karenga denied any involvement in the torture, and argued that the prosecution was political in nature. He was imprisoned at the California Men's Colony, where he studied and wrote on feminism, Pan-Africanism, and other subjects. The US Organization fell into disarray during his absence and was disbanded in 1974. After he petitioned several black state officials to support his parole on fair sentencing grounds, it was granted in 1975.Karenga has declined to discuss the convictions with reporters and does not mention them in biographical materials. During a 2007 appearance at Wabash College, he again denied the charges and described himself as a former political prisoner.\n\nLater career\nAfter his parole, Karenga re-established the US Organization under a new structure.He was awarded his first Ph.D. in 1976 from United States International University (now known as Alliant International University) for a 170-page dissertation titled \"Afro-American Nationalism: Social Strategy and Struggle for Community\". In 1977, he formulated a set of principles called Kawaida, a Swahili term for normal. Karenga called on African-Americans to adopt his secular humanism and reject other practices as mythical.He was also the director of the Kawaida Institute for Pan African Studies and the author of several books, including his Introduction to Black Studies, a comprehensive Black/African Studies textbook now in its fourth edition (2010), originally published in 1982. He is also known for having co-hosted, in 1984, a conference that gave rise to the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations. \nIn 1994, he was awarded a second Ph.D. in social ethics from the University of Southern California for an 803-page dissertation titled \"Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics.\" In 1995, he sat on the organizing committee and authored the mission statement of the Million Man March.Karenga delivered a eulogy at the 2001 funeral service of New Black Panther Party leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad, praising him for his organizing activities and commitment to black empowerment. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Maulana Karenga on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.As of 2021, Karenga chairs the Africana Studies Department at California State University, Long Beach.\n\nFilms\nOwen Alik Shahadah's documentary 500 Years Later (2005) and its sequel Motherland (2010)\nM.K.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nReggae rock\nReggae rock is a subgenre of reggae fusion and rock music that primarily uses the genres reggae, rock, and ska. Typical lyrics of reggae rock songs incorporate love, personal awareness, and life challenges while incorporating music and beat elements of rock, punk, and hip-hop. The term \"reggae rock\" has been used to categorize bands like the Police, Men at Work, Sublime, Sublime with Rome, No Doubt, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, the Expendables, Iration, the Dirty Heads, Rebelution, 311 and, to some extent, heavier bands such as Bad Brains.\nAmong the earliest examples of the genre are the 1972 songs \"D'yer Mak'er\" by English rock band Led Zeppelin and \"C Moon\" by Paul McCartney and Wings.The term \"reggae metal\" has been used to describe bands that combine reggae rock with heavy metal, such as Dub War, Shinobi Ninja, Skindred, Twelve Foot Ninja, and Zeroscape. Reggae rock found its rise in popularity in the 1990s in Long Beach, California, with the band Sublime. The genre has lately found a boost in popularity with the 2010 song \"Lay Me Down\" by the Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez from Sublime with Rome, which peaked at number 1 on both the US Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts.With reggae rock rising in popularity, the genre was included in the inaugural California Roots Music & Arts Festival in 2010.\nPassage 2:\nStreet punk\nStreet punk (sometimes alternatively spelled streetpunk) is an urban working class-based subgenre of punk rock, which partly emerged as a rebellion against the perceived artistic pretensions of the first wave of British punk. Street punk emerged from the style of Oi! and hardcore punk bands. A key band in defining the aesthetic was the Exploited. Street punks generally have a much more ostentatious and flamboyant appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Street punks commonly sported multi-coloured hair, mohawks, tattoos, heavily studded vests and leather jackets, and clothing, especially plaids, adorned with political slogans, patches, and/or the names of punk bands. In the 1990s and 2000s, a street punk revival began with emerging street punk bands such as the Casualties.\n\nCharacteristics\nStreet punk music is characterized by single-note guitar lines and short solos. Unlike similar genres, such as traditional hardcore punk, street punk bands sometimes consisted of two guitarists, one of which plays guitar melodies while not singing. Street punk also makes frequent use of communal vocals, gang vocals, and sing–along choruses. Street punk lyrics commonly address topics such as fighting, drinking, partying, inner-city turmoil or personal relationships. Street punk bands sometimes express political viewpoints, typically of a left-wing variety, although some street punks eschew politics altogether in favor of a more hedonistic, nihilistic outlook. Street punk also had influences from New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands like Iron Maiden and Motörhead.Punk veteran Felix Havoc said:\n\nIt was aggressive, yet had melody. As opposed to today's \"melodic\" punk it still had a lot of energy. It was honest. Hence the term \"street punk.\" There is and was a feel that this was the kids music, from the streets, and was uncorrupted by \"professionalism\" or \"musicianship.\" As opposed to the anarcho bands its message was more bleak and irreverent. The music was not a-political, just a less intellectual expression of political views of working class youth. The music was marketed as being of and by the working class. I suspect this was not universally the case. Still most middle and upper class kids cringe at frank discussions of violence as evidenced in a typical Blitz song. Early 80's UK punk was catchy as hell; it has sing-a-long choruses and hooky riffs.\n\nHistory\nOrigins (1980s)\nUK 82\nUK 82 (also known as UK hardcore or second wave punk) took the existing punk sound and added faster drumbeats and an aggressive distorted guitar sound. The term UK 82 is taken from the title of a song by the Exploited. Cross-pollination existed between this era of British street punk and American hardcore punk.The lyrics of UK 82 bands tended to be much darker and more violent than the lyrics of earlier punk bands. They tended to focus on the possibilities of a nuclear holocaust, and other apocalyptic themes, partially due to the military tension of the Cold War atmosphere. The other mainstay of the lyrics of the era was unemployment, and the policies of the Conservative Party government. Lyrics frequently denounced the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher in the same way that American hardcore punk bands addressed the Ronald Reagan administration.\nThe three most prominent UK82 bands, according to Ian Glasper, are the Exploited, Discharge, and GBH. The Exploited were controversial due to their aggressive lyrics and rowdy concerts, and were considered by Glasper to be \"cartoon punks\". Glasper wrote: \"For many, The Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses-searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter 'Wattie' Buchan's archetypal orange mohican.\" Discharge's early work proved to be enormously influential, providing the blueprint for an entire subgenre. Their later work, however, has been described as moving into heavy metal.\n\nD-beat\nD-beat (also known as Discore or käng (boot), in Sweden) was developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band Discharge, for whom the genre is named. The first such group was the Varukers. The vocal content of D-beat tends towards shouted slogans. The style is distinct from its predecessors by its minimal lyrical content and greater proximity to heavy metal. It is closely associated with crust punk, which is a heavier, more complex variation. D-beat bands typically have anti-war, anarchist messages and closely follow the bleak nuclear war imagery of 1980s anarcho-punk bands. The style was particularly popular in Sweden, and was developed there by groups such as Anti Cimex and Mob 47.\n\nRevival (1990s and 2000s)\nIn the 1990s, a new era of street punk began with emerging street punk bands like the Casualties and Rancid, The Casualties became one of the most well-known street punk bands and achieved underground success. Their 2004 album On the Front Line peaked at number 8 on the Independent Albums chart. On the Front Line and the Casualties' 2006 album Under Attack peaked at numbers 7 and 9 on the Heatthe soundtrack of the 1986 movie Sid and Nancy, and was heard in the film.\nChris Poland played bass with Circle Jerks briefly circa 1989 after being fired as guitarist for Megadeth (Schloss had left the band by that point).\n\nHiatus (1990–1993)\nCircle Jerks dissolved in 1990 after Hetson left the band to continue recording with Bad Religion. Live recordings made during what would be their final tour at the time were immortalized in the live album Gig in 1992, their third and last release for Relativity.\nDuring the hiatus, Hetson would continue playing in Bad Religion; Schloss played guitar and bass with various acts; Clark initially retired from music; Morris worked menial jobs and battled health problems (he had kicked a longtime dependence on drugs and alcohol in 1988).\n\nReunions and hiatuses (1994–2011)\nA long period of inactivity for Circle Jerks ended in 1994, when the Wonderful-era lineup reunited and signed a major label deal with Mercury Records, a move that had a few business complications: Hetson was still with Bad Religion, who had signed a long-term contract with Atlantic Records, while Schloss had been part of a band contracted to Interscope Records. After ironing out these difficulties, the band recorded their final studio album to date, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, released June 20, 1995. One track on the album, a cover of the Soft Boys' \"I Wanna Destroy You\", featured backing vocals from pop singer/songwriter Deborah Gibson, who had just finished a solo album with the same producer that Circle Jerks were using. Gibson later made a surprise appearance at Circle Jerks' performance at punk mecca CBGB to perform \"I Wanna Destroy You\" with the band. Despite such media attention, the group suddenly imploded three weeks into a tour behind the album. The breakup would not be totally permanent, with the Jerks playing sporadically throughout the late 1990s, but Clark left music for good afterward. Original bassist Rogerson died in 1996 of a drug overdose. He was 41 years old.\nFurther Circle Jerks activity was suddenly held up when Morris announced that he had been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes in 1999. A multitude of punk bands held benefits on his behalf.\nThe core of Morris, Hetson and Schloss, with drummer Kevin Fitzgerald, continued to tour until 2011, in between other commitments — Hetson was still a full-time member of Bad Religion, Schloss played bass for the reformed first-generation LA punk band the Weirdos, and Morris was an A&R director for V2 Records until the label was suddenly shuttered by its owners in 2007.\nIn 2004, the Circle Jerks shot a live concert DVD as part of Kung-Fu Records' live DVD series The Show Must Go Off!, in which the band played songs from all six of their studio albums, plus – in nods to Schloss' other current band and Morris' first band, respectively – covers of the Weirdos' \"Solitary Confinement\" and Black Flag's \"Nervous Breakdown\". In 2005, Hetson formed another band, Black President.\nFor several years, a rumored Circle Jerks album featuring new material was said to be imminent, although no further formal announcement was made. In late February 2007, the band released their first new song since 1995 on their Myspace page, titled \"I'm Gonna Live\", adding more anticipation to the possibility of a new album emerging. However, in an April 2008 interview, guitarist Hetson admitted that Circle Jerks would not release any new studio material, saying that he does not know what will happen in the future, \"but in the near future, no Circle Jerks stuff will come out\".Circle Jerks were featured on a television commercial for XM Satellite Radio (they were the first band played in the commercial, which included \"Operation\" from the album Group Sex), and the band also posted a cover of  Germs song \"The Slave\" on their Myspace page.\nThe Circle Jerks played their final show for nearly a decade at the Bluebird Theater in Denver on January 27, 2011.From 2011 to 2019, the Circle Jerks were on hiatus due to a dispute between Morris and the rest of the band. The conflict was over songs that were written by Morris and Dimitri Coats. Coats (from Burning Brides), who was supposed to produce a new Circle Jerks album, decided that the songs Hetson had written were not up to par with Circle Jerks' catalog. Morris agreed, and both he and Coats wrote multiple songs intended for the new album. The other members of Circle Jerks believed Coats to be \"arrogant, overbearing, egotistical\" and called for him to be fired from producing the new record. Morris disagreed, and he and Coats recruited Steven Shane McDonald (from Redd Kross) and Mario Rubalcaba (Rocket from the Crypt, Hot Snakes, 411, Clikatat Ikatowi, Earthless) to start a new band called Off!.\n\nGroup Sex anniversary shows (2019–present)\nOn November 22, 2019, the Circle Jerks announced that they were going to reunite in 2020 for a number of shows to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their debut album Group Sex, including that year's Punk Rock Bowling. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused performances to be postponed until 2021. Three-fourths of the final lineup — Keith Morris, guitarist Greg Hetson, bassist Zander Schloss — were involved in the reunion.\nOn July 15, 2021 it was announced that former Queens of the Stone Age and Danzig drummer Joey Castillo would be joining the band on drums.In April 2022, six dates on the anniversary tour were postponed after Morris tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nBand members\nCurrent members\nKeith Morris – vocals (1979–1990, 1994–1995, 2001–2011, 2019–present)\nGreg Hetson – guitars (1979–1990, 1994–1995, 2001–2011, 2019–present)\nZander Schloss – bass (1984–1988, 1989-1990, 1994–1995, 2001–2011, 2019–present)\nJoey Castillo – drums (2021–present)\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\nGroup Sex (1980)\nWild in the Streets (1982)\nGolden Shower of Hits (1983)\nWonderful (1985)\nVI (1987)\nOddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities (1995)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nYIVO\nYIVO (Yiddish: ייִוואָ, [jiˈvɔ]) is an organization that preserves, studies, and teaches the cultural history of Jewish life throughout Eastern Europe, Germany, and Russia as well as orthography, lexicography, and other studies related to Yiddish. (The word yidisher means both \"Yiddish\" and \"Jewish.\")  Established in 1925 in Wilno in the Second Polish Republic (now Vilnius, Lithuania) as the Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut (Yiddish: ייִדישער װיסנשאַפֿטלעכער אינסטיטוט, pronounced [ˈjidiʃɛr ˈvisn.ʃaftlɛχɛr instiˈtut], Yiddish Scientific Institute, its English name became Institute for Jewish Research after its relocation to New York City, but it is still known mainly by its Yiddish acronym. YIVO is now a partner of the Center for Jewish History. Formerly, they had linguists whose main occupation was deciding on grammar rules and new words, and during this time they were seen in the secular world to serve as the recognized language regulator of the Yiddish language. However, YIVO no longer serves this purpose. Nevertheless, the YIVO system is still commonly taught in universities and known as klal shprakh (spelled in Yiddish:כּלל־שפּראַך, meaning 'standard language') and sometimes \"YIVO Yiddish\" (spelled in Yiddish:ייִוואָ־ייִדיש).\n\nActivities\nYIVO preserves manuscripts, rare books, and diaries, and other Yiddish sources.  The YIVO Library in New York contains over 385,000 volumes dating from as early as the 16th century. Approximately 40,000 volumes are in Yiddish, making the YIVO Library the largest collection of Yiddish-language works in the world. The YIVO archives hold over 23,000,000 documents, photographs, recordings, posters, films, and other artifacts. Together, they comprise the world's largest collection of materials related to the history and culture of Central and East European Jewry and the American Jewish immigrant experience.  The archives and library collections include works in twelve major languages, including English, French,  German, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, and Judaeo-Spanish.YIVO also functions as a publisher of Yiddish-language books and of periodicals including YIVO Bleter (founded 1931), Yedies Fun YIVO (founded 1929), and Yidishe Shprakh (founded 1941). It is also responsible for English-language publications such as the YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Studies (founded 1946).\n\nHistory\nYIVO was initially proposed by Yiddish linguist and writer Nochum Shtif (1879–1933). He characterized his advocacy of Yiddish as \"realistic\" Zionism, contrasted to the \"visionary\" Hebraists and the \"self-hating\" assimilationists who adopted Russian or Polish. Other key founders included philologist Max Weinreich (1894–1969) and historian Elias Tcherikower (1881–1943).YIVO was founded at a Berlin conference in 1925, but headquartered in Vilna, a city with a large Jewish population in the Second Polish Republic. The early YIVO also had branches in Berlin, Warsaw and New York City. Over the next decade, smaller groups arose in many of the other countries with Ashkenazi populations.\nIn YIVO's first decades, Tcherikover headed the historical research section, which also included Simon Dubnow, Saul M. Ginsburg, Abraham Menes, and Jacob Shatzky. Leibush Lehrer (1887–1964) headed a section including psychologists and educators Abraham Golomb, H. S. Kasdan, and Abraham Aaron Roback. Jacob Lestschinsky (1876–1966) headed a section of economists and demographers Ben-Adir, Liebmann Hersch, and Moshe Shalit. Weinreich's language and literature section included Judah Leib Cahan, Alexander Harkavy, Judah A. Joffe, Zelig Kalmanovich, Shmuel Niger, Noach Pryłucki, and Zalman Reisen. YIVO also collected and preserved ethnographic materials under the direction of its Ethnographic Committee.  In 1925, YIVO's honorary board of trustees or \"Curatorium\" consisted of Simon Dubnow, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Moses Gaster, Edward Sapir and Chaim Zhitlowsky.\nFrom 1934 to 1940, YIVO operated a graduate training program known as the Aspirantur. Named after Zemach Shabad, YIVO's chairman, the program held classes and guided students in conducting original research in the field of Jewish studies. Many of the students' projects were sociological in nature (reflecting the involvement of Max Weinreich) and gathered information on contemporary Jewish life in the Vilna region.The Nazi advance into Eastern Europe caused YIVO to move its operations to New York City. A second important center, known as the Fundacion IWO, was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina. All four directors of YIVO's research sections were already in the Americas when the war broke out or were able to make their way there. The organization's new headquarters were established in New York City. A portion of the Vilna archives was ransacked by the Nazis and sent to Frankfurt to become the basis of an anti-Semitic department of the Nazis' planned university. In 1946, the U.S. Army recovered these documents and sent them to YIVO in New York.The YIVO Library was looted by the Germans and the ERR, but an organization that called itself \"The Paper Brigade\" were able to smuggle out many books and preserve them from destruction. These materials were then saved from the Soviets by a Lithuanian librarian, Antanas Ulpis. These materials are now held in the Lithuanian Central State Archives and Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania. In 2014, with the cooperation of the government of the Republic of Lithuania, Brent established the landmark Edward Blank YIVO Vilna Online Collections project at The YIVO Institute to preserve and digitize over 1.5 million documents and approximately 12,200 books representing 500 years of Jewish history in Eastern Europe and Russia.In addition to New York City and Buenos Aires, the Chicago YIVO Society is a third center active today.\n\nPublications\nYIVO has undertaken many major scholarly publication projects, the most recent being The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe, published in March 2008 in cooperation with Yale University Press.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCheval de frise\nThe cheval de frise (plural: chevaux de frise [ʃə.vo də fʁiz], \"Frisian horses\") was a defensive obstacle, existing in a number of forms, principally as a static anti-cavalry obstacle but also quickly movable to close breaches.  The term was also applied to underwater constructions used to prevent the passage of ships or other vessels on rivers.  In the anti-cavalry role the cheval de frise typically comprised a portable frame (sometimes just a simple log) with many projecting spikes.  Wire obstacles ultimately made this type of device obsolete. \nThe invention of the cheval de frise is attributed to ancient China. The concept of using a defensive obstacle made of wooden or metal stakes predates its use in Europe. Historical records suggest that similar types of defensive barriers, known as \"teng pai\" or \"mó pai\", were used in China as early as the 4th century BC. These early versions of the cheval de frise were employed to protect cities, forts, and other strategic locations from enemy attacks.\nThe use of chevaux de frise spread to Europe during the Middle Ages and became a common feature of medieval fortifications. They were used extensively in castle defenses and military campaigns, particularly during the Renaissance and early modern periods. However, the original concept and early usage of the cheval de frise can be traced back to ancient China.\nDuring the American Civil War the Confederates used them more than the Union forces. During World War I, armies used chevaux de frise to temporarily plug gaps in barbed wire. Barbed wire chevaux de frise were used in jungle fighting on the South Pacific islands during World War II.\nThe term is also applied to defensive works on buildings. This includes a series of closely set upright stones found outside the ramparts of Iron Age hillforts in northern Europe, or iron spikes outside homes in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nEtymology\nIn French, cheval de frise means \"Frisian horse\". The Frisians fought predominantly using cavalry; they were known for being formidable horsemen, and Frisian horses were renowned for their strength and agility. Therefore, for defense they relied heavily on anti-cavalry obstacles. The Dutch also adopted the use of these defensive devices when at war with Spain. The term cheval de frise came to be used for any spiked obstacle, such as broken glass embedded in mortar at the top of a wall.\nThe cheval de frise was adopted in New York and Pennsylvania during the American Revolutionary War as a defensive measure installed on rivers to prevent upriver movement by enemy ships. During the Peninsular War, at the siege of Badajoz in 1812, a cheval de frise was successfully deployed to fill a breach in the town wall, allowing the French to inflict heavy casualties on the British storm troops.\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War\nDuring the American Revolutionary War both Thaddeus Kosciuszko and Robert Erskine designed an anti-ship version of the cheval-de-frise to prevent British warships from proceeding up the Delaware River and Hudson River, respectively. A cheval de frise by Erskine's design was placed between Fort Washington at northern Manhattan and Fort Lee in New Jersey in 1776. The following year construction began on one to the north of West Point at Pollepel Island, but it was overshadowed by the completion of the Great Chain across the Hudson in 1778, which was used through 1782.\n\nSimilar devices planned by Ben Franklin and designed by Robert Smith were used in the Delaware River near Philadelphia, between Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer. Two other lines of chevaux-de-frise were also placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and Fort Billingsport, New Jersey as a first line of defense for Philadelphia against the British naval forces.A cheval de frise was retrieved from the Delaware River in Philadelphia on November 13, 2007, in excellent condition, after more than two centuries in the river. In November 2012, a 29-foot (9 m) spike from a cheval-de-frise was recovered from Delaware off Bristol Township; it was also believed to be from the Revolutionary era installation at Philadelphia and freed up by Hurricane Sandy earlier that fall.\n\nLegacy\nA small promontory on the north-east Essex coast in the United Kingdom (UK), between Holland Haven and Frinton-on-Sea, was named Chevaux de Frise Point.\n\nSee also\nCzech hedgehog\nPassage 2:\nJacob Haish\nJacob Haish (March 9, 1826 – February 19, 1926) was one of the first inventors of barbed wire. His type of barbed wire was in direct competition with the other barbed wire manufacturers in DeKalb, Illinois. He was a known carpenter and architect in DeKalb County and designed several prominent DeKalb homes.\n\nEarly life\nHaish was born in Baden, Germany on March 9, 1826, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1835. He came to Illinois in 1845, married Sophie Ann Brown in 1847, and moved to DeKalb in 1853, where he was a carpenter. He cultivated osage orange hedges whose thorns made them effective as cattle fencing.\n\nThe birth of barbed wire\nIn late 1872, Henry Rose developed a wire fence with an attached wooden strip containing projecting wire points to dissuade encroaching livestock. He patented his fence in May 1873 and exhibited it at the DeKalb County Fair that summer. This prompted Haish and other DeKalb residents Isaac Ellwood and Joseph Glidden to work on improving the concept.  Haish had patented three styles of barbed fencing by June 1874. When Haish's patent for an \"S-barb\" design was granted in August 1875, he launched a drawn out legal battle to stymie his rivals. It failed at the US Supreme Court in 1895.\n\nHaish gifts a library\nIn 1893, the city council of DeKalb, Illinois, decreed the establishment of a public library.  The impetus for this ordinance was requests from the Ladies of the Library Association, a group that had conducted a reading room for several years. The library moved twice before the Haish gift came along; it was first located on the second floor of the city hall and then, in 1923, moved to the second floor of the DeKalb Daily Chronicle building on Lincoln Highway.\nJacob Haish died at his home in DeKalb on February 19, 1926. He had bequested a $150,000 gift for a library building in his will. The result was the Haish Memorial Library in downtown DeKalb.\n\nSee also\nGeorge H. Gurler House\nJoseph F.

In 1867, he served on the executive committee of DeKalb County Agriculture and Mechanical Society's Seventh Annual Fall Fair, held September 25–28. In 1876, he was the Democratic nominee for Illinois State Senator. From 1861 to 1874, he served as a member of the board of school directors, and for 20 years paid the largest school tax of any citizen of the county. He was also one of the largest contributors to the erection of one of the churches. He was also vice-president of the DeKalb National Bank, director of the North Western Railroad, and owner of the DeKalb Rolling Mill.\n\nDemonstration of use in Texas changes ranching\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of barbed wire, Glidden and his sales agent for the State of Texas, Marques Fortner, in 1881 developed the \"Frying Pan Ranch\" in Bushland in Potter County near Amarillo, Texas. The wire was brought in by wagon from the railhead at Dodge City, Kansas, and the timbers were cut from Palo Duro Canyon and along the Canadian River Valley. A herd of 12,000 head of cattle was branded with the \"Panhandle Brand\", which the cowboys called \" frying pan\". The ranch proved the success of the wire and changed ranching.Henry B. Sanborn, a sales representative for Glidden's company, owned a ranch in Grayson County north of Dallas and wished to advertise barbed wire there. In 1881, Sanborn purchased ninety-five sections of land in southwestern Potter County from near the Canadian River extending into Randall County south of Amarillo. Included in the purchase was Tecovas Spring, once a watering site and a trading post for Indians and Comancheros. John Summerfield, a surveyor from Sherman, Texas, reported a constant flow of freshwater from the spring. Sanborn chose this site for his ranch headquarters and enclosed 120 miles of land in barbed wire for $39,000 ($1.18 million in 2022 dollars). Warren W. Wetzel, also of Sherman, used cedar posts brought from both the Palo Duro Canyon and the breaks of the Sierrita de la Cruz in the northwestern portion of the ranch to hold up the wire.Besides ranchers, railroads were large purchasers of barbed wire, so that cattle did not stray onto their tracks. The Frying Pan Ranch soon had 15,000 head of cattle, and 125,000 more acres were added. Later the ranch was divided. In 1898, Glidden deeded Frying Pan Ranch to his son-in-law William Henry Bush. Between 1908 and 1920, William Henry Bush and his second wife Ruth Bush built a larger ranch house near Tecovas Spring, which later became the residence of Stanley Marsh 3 and his wife, Wendy. Gwendolyn “Wendy” Bush O’Brien was the daughter of Emeline Bush and her husband Frank O’Brien; Emeline was a daughter of William Henry and Ruth Bush. Stanley Marsh called the estate “Toad Hall.”\n\nLand for the Northern Illinois State Normal School\nGlidden, a former teacher, gave 63 acres (255,000 m2) of his homestead as a site for the Northern Illinois State Normal School. The school opened on September 12, 1898, with 139 students and 16 members of the faculty. The school's name was changed to Northern Illinois University in 1957.\nThe town of Glidden, Iowa, is named in his honor.\n\nPersonal life\nHe and his wife Lucinda had one daughter, Elva Frances, in 1851. She married William Henry Bush in DeKalb on February 1, 1877. His wife Lucinda died on October 28, 1895.Elva died in 1906 not long before her father died, and is buried in the Glidden family plot in a cemetery in DeKalb.\nIn 1898, Glidden deeded his Frying Pan ranch in Texas to his son-in-law, W. H. Bush. Bush married again in 1908, after being widowed, to Ruth Russell Gentry. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe \"barbed wire salesman\" in Back to the Future Part III is either based on Joseph F.

The song sarcastically recounts the location of various army members, not to be found in the combat zone, and concludes by describing the location of the old battalion: \"hanging on the old barbed wire\". A barbed wire fence separated the front-line trench from no man's land, and men brave or unfortunate enough to go over the top of the dug-out were often quickly shot and their bodies caught in the barbed wire. This troop song was not popular with officers, who thought it bad for morale, though attempts to suppress it were unsuccessful.\n\nLyrics\nThere are several different versions of this song, though all share the final two lines. One version:\n\nA variant last line is \"if you want to find the privates\".Another variation fourth verse sees C.O replaced with colonel, put at the start and, \"He's On another 7 days leave\".\n\nCovers\nThe song was included on the 1988 album English Rebel Songs 1381–1914 by the English anarchist punk band Chumbawamba, as well as on their 2003 re-recording of the same album (English Rebel Songs 1381–1984).\nA shortened version of the song was also included on the 2018 album The Blind Leading the Blind by the Ukrainian metal band 1914 as an interlude. The band's songs are all related to WWI events.\nThe song was covered by death industrial band Maruta Kommand on their 2000 album \"Holocaust Rites\".\nThe song is part of the \"Great War Trilogy\" (The Valley of the Shadow / The Old Barbed Wire / Long, Long Trail) sung by John Roberts and Tony Barrand in their album,   A Present from the Gentlemen: A Pandora's Box of English Folk Songs (Golden Hind Music, GHM-101, 1992).\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The district, with Martadi (today part of Badimalika municipality) as its district headquarters, covers an area of 2,188 km2 (845 sq mi) and had a population of 108,781 in 2001 and 134,912 in 2011.The annual rainfall is about 13,433 mm and temperatures vary from 0 °C to 40 °C. The livelihood of more than 80% of the district population depends on agriculture farming, mainly small scale livestock. Due to low level of agricultural production, the majority of the households face acute food shortages for a large part of the year. According to the National Census 2011, the total population of the district is 134,912 comprising 69,106 female (51%) and 65,806 male (49%) residing in 24,908 households. Bajura district has an average population density of around 62 people per square km. The average family size is 5.4. Life expectancy of the people is 58 years. The average literacy rate is about 32%. Bajura district has a multi ethnic composition with Chhetri, Kami, Thakuri, Brahman, Damai, SarkI and Sanyashi (Giri and Puri). The common language is Nepali (96%) followed by Bhote Sherpa (0.46%) and Tamang (0.42%). Although accessibility to Bajura is very poor, this is improving rapidly. The Government strategy is mainly focused on the connection of VDC headquarters with all-weather motor able roads to SRN or District headquarters. Moreover, the DDC body of Bajura district has given higher priority on rural roads.\n\nGeography and Climate\nThe district has nine municipalities, 9 Ilakas (administrative areas) and 1 constituency areas. The district is situated in Longitude between 81° 10′ 20″ to 81° 48′ 27″ East and Latitude 29° 16′ 21″ to 29° 56′ 56″ North. Geographically the district is divided in three distinct regions from north to south viz. Higher Himalayan Region, Higher Mountain and mid – Mountains. The Higher Himalayan region comprises Saipal Himalayan range; High Mountain region comprises Doha Lekh and Ghori Lekh. Similarly, Mid-Mountain range comprises different ranges of mountains e.g. Badimalika Temple. The District has started from 300m to 6400m in height.\n\nDemographics\nAt the time of the 2011 Nepal census, Bajura District had a population of 134,912.\nAs their first language, 99.2% spoke Nepali, 0.5% Sherpa, 0.1% Tamang and 0.1% other languages.Ethnicity/caste: 57.8% were Chhetri, 9.8% Kami, 7.0% Hill Brahmin, 5.2% Thakuri, 5.0% Sarki, 4.2% Damai/Dholi, 3.9% Lohar, 2.4% Sanyasi/Dasnami, 1.4% Badi, 1.0% Bhote, 0.9% other Dalit, 0.3% Kumal, 0.2% Teli, 0.1% Limbu, 0.1% Magar, 0.1% Mallaha, 0.1% Musalman, 0.1% Tamang, 0.1% other Terai, 0.1% Tharu and 0.2% others.Religion: 98.7% were Hindu, 1.1% Buddhist, 0.1% Christian and 0.1% Muslim,Literacy: 55.4% could read and write, 2.5% could only read and 42.1% could neither read nor write.\n\nAdministration\nThe district consists of nine municipalities, out of which four are urban municipalities and five are rural municipalities. These are as follows:\nBadimalika Municipality\nTriveni Municipality\nBudhiganga Municipality\nBudhinanda Municipality\nGaumul Rural Municipality\nJagnnath Rural Municipality\nSwamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality\nChhededaha Rural Municipality\nHimali Rural Municipality\n\nFormer Village Development Committees\nPrior to the restructuring of the district, Bajura District consisted of the following Village development committees:\n\nHealth care\nThe small health centres in many VDCs are without Auxiliary Health Workers (AHWs), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Community Health Workers (CHWs). Primary or normal treatment can be done in the district headquarters and also in Bayalpata Hospital of neighbouring district Accham while people seeking severe cases have to travel a long distance to Kathmandu or other major cities or end up dying because of lack of treatment. Many people still believe in Dhami and Jhakri and do not always seek medical or go to the hospital for treatment. An NGO, PHASE Nepal provides many health care facilities and training programs to six VDCs: Kolti, Wai, Kotila, Pandusain, Rugin and Bandhu. Many people residing in these VDCs have benefited from the program.Currently PHASE Nepal is working on several projects in this district including community health and education, livelihood, hygiene, sanitation and diarrhoea mitigation programmes. PHASE Nepal also conduct education programs like teacher training and girls empowerment programme.\n\nColleges and School in Bajura\nMartadi, Bajura\n\nBajura Multiple CampusIt has been conditioning the bachelor level programs with affiliation to Tribhuwan University, Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal.\n\nBadimalika English Boarding School\nConverse Academy\nShree Malika Higher Secondary SchoolKolti, Bajura \n\nShree Jana Prakash Higher Secondary SchoolNaubis, Bajura\n\nShree Bhanodaya higher Secondary School\nBadimalika Multiple CampusIt is conducting the Bachelor's level program BBS, BEd & B.A. with affiliation to Tribhuwan University\nTriveni, Bajura\n\nRatna Higher Secondary School, Seliphal, Bajura.It was established in 2022 BS, it recently started offering +2 level program in Humanities and Education stream.\n\nMasteshwori Higher Secondary School, Pandhara, Bajura.The school is providing plus two level program in Humanities and Education stream.\n\nTolidewal Danda Secondary School, Toli, Bajura.The school is providing plus two level program in Humanities and Education stream1 and W21, and 40–45 minutes for M20 and W20. Middle distances often take place in forests. Competitors race individually, typically starting with 2 minute gaps between the competitors. Fastest time to punch all the controls in the right order and cross the finish line wins.\n\nLong Distance\nThe long distance is the longest discipline. Winning times are 105–115 minutes for M21 and W21, and 84–92 minutes for M20 and W20. Long distances often take place in forests. Competitors race individually, typically starting with 3 minute gaps between the competitors. Fastest time to punch all the controls in the right order and cross the finish line wins.\n\nMass Start\nThe mass start is known as the most chaotic discipline. Winning times are 75–85 minutes for M21 and W21, and 60–68 minutes for M20 and W20. Mass starts often take place in forests. Competitors all start at the same time, hence the name mass start. In order to keep competitors from just following each other and ensuring they have to orienteer themselves, there are 'forkings' on mass starts. This means that not all competitors have to ride to the control points in the same order. It could for example be 2 loops called A and B where half the competitors do A first and then B, and the other half does B first and then A. All competitors will end up riding the exact same course in the end, but will have to split up during the race. First competitor to punch all controls in the right order and cross the finish line wins.\n\nRelay\nThe relay is a team-discipline. There are 3 competitors on each team, taking turn to ride their course. Winning times are 120–135 minutes (total) for M21 and W21, and 90–105 minutes for M20 and W20. Relays often take place in forests. The first competitors on all teams start at the same time, similar to the mass start. When they cross the finish line and touch their team's next competitor, the next competitor continues the race. Similarly to the mass start, there are forkings on the relay, so competitors can't just follow other riders. All teams will end up riding the exact same courses in the end, but in different orders. First team to all finish their courses and cross the finish line wins.\n\nRules\nThere is a set of rules which must be followed when competing at events. If not followed, it can lead to disqualification. The most prominent rules are:\n\nCompetitors may not leave their bike; it has to be ridden, carried or pushed at all times.\nCompetitors may only ride on paths and roads that are on the map, unless otherwise described. In some countries or areas riders are allowed to ride off-track, which will be specified in the event bulletin.\nCompetitors may not use GPS devices while competing in a race.For a full list of the rules, see MTBO Competition Rules\n\nMost recent World Championships\nThe most recent World Championships were in Finland, Kuortane from 9 to 18 June 2021.

Avalanche Lake sits at 2,885 feet (879 m) between 4,714-foot (1,437 m) Mount Colden and 3,816-foot (1,163 m) Avalanche Mountain. The two mountains rise in vertical cliffs from the surface of the lake. Immediately west of Avalanche Mountain (formerly known as Caribou Mountain) lies the MacIntyre Range: 5,115-foot (1,559 m) Algonquin Peak (the second highest mountain in the state), 4,829-foot (1,472 m) Boundary Peak, 4,843-foot (1,476 m) Iroquois Peak and 4,380-foot (1,340 m) Mount Marshall. Mount Marcy is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) to the east. Avalanche Lake feeds Lake Colden to the south, in the Hudson River watershed. To the north, the trail to the lake from the Adirondak Loj surmounts Avalanche Pass, which is only slightly above lake level but separates it from the Lake Champlain (St. Lawrence River) watershed. Following the lake toward Lake Colden, the trail is choked with large boulders, and a number of wooden ladders have been built to make passage possible. There are also three places where the trail takes to wooden catwalks, first built in the 1920s, that are bolted directly into the cliff face. This section is known as the \"Hitch-Up Matilda;\" in 1868 when a mountain guide waded to carry one of his clients past a point with no footing on shore, her husband urged her to sit higher on his shoulders.\n\nHistory\nThe European discovery of the lake dates to an 1833 surveying party led by Judge John Richards and Major Reuben Sanford; it was named by William C. Redfield. A large avalanche occurred on August 20, 1869, that created a number of the landslides on Mount Colden, the rubble from which substantially raised the level of the lake. Another avalanche in 1942 caused further slides that raised the lake level by 10 feet (3.0 m).\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nVaccine\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented completely.The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twenty-five different preventable infections.The first recorded use of Inoculation to prevent smallpox occurred in the 16th century in China, with the earliest hints of the practice in China coming during the 10th century . It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced.The folk practice of inoculation against smallpox was brought from Turkey to Britain in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.\nThe terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner (who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine) to denote cowpox. He used the phrase in 1798 for the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed. The science of vaccine development and production is termed vaccinology.\n\nEffects\nThere is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. The immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the agent, and thus is prepared to respond, by first neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and secondly by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.Limitations to their effectiveness, nevertheless, exist. Sometimes, protection fails for vaccine-related reasons such as failures in vaccine attenuation, vaccination regimens or administration.Failure may also occur for host-related reasons if the host's immune system does not respond adequately or at all. Host-related lack of response occurs in an estimated 2-10% of individuals, due to factors including genetics, immune status, age, health and nutritional status. One type of primary immunodeficiency disorder resulting in genetic failure is X-linked agammaglobulinemia, in which the absence of an enzyme essential for B cell development prevents the host's immune system from generating antibodies to a pathogen.Host–pathogen interactions and responses to infection are dynamic processes involving multiple pathways in the immune system. A host does not develop antibodies instantaneously: while the body's innate immunity may be activated in as little as twelve hours, adaptive immunity can take 1–2 weeks to fully develop. During that time, the host can still become infected.Once antibodies are produced, they may promote immunity in any of several ways, depending on the class of antibodies involved. Their success in clearing or inactivating a pathogen will depend on the amount of antibodies produced and on the extent to which those antibodies are effective at countering the strain of the pathogen involved, since different strains may be differently susceptible to a given immune reaction. \nIn some cases vaccines may result in partial immune protection (in which immunity is less than 100% effective but still reduces risk of infection) or in temporary immune protection (in which immunity wanes over time) rather than full or permanent immunity. They can still raise the reinfection threshold for the population as a whole and make a substantial impact. They can also mitigate the severity of infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, faster recovery from illness, and a wide range of other effects.Those who are older often display less of a response than those who are younger, a pattern known as Immunosenescence.Adjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response, particularly for older people whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened.The efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on several factors:\n\nthe disease itself (for some diseases vaccination performs better than for others)\nthe strain of vaccine (some vaccines are specific to, or at least most effective against, particular strains of the disease)\nwhether the vaccination schedule has been properly observed.\nidiosyncratic response to vaccination; some individuals are \"non-responders\" to certain vaccines, meaning that they do not generate antibodies even after being vaccinated correctly.\nassorted factors such as ethnicity, age, or genetic predisposition.If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated cases.Important considerations in an effective vaccination program:\ncareful modeling to anticipate the effect that an immunization campaign will have on the epidemiology of the disease in the medium to long term\nongoing surveillance for the relevant disease following introduction of a new vaccine\nmaintenance of high immunization rates, even when a disease has become rareIn 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. After the introduction of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. Fifty-four of those infections were associated with importation from another country, although only thirteen percent were actually acquired outside the United States; 63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.Vaccines led to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowwas a colony in British North America which comprised the former French colony of Canada. It was established by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1763, following the conquest of New France by British forces during the Seven Years' War. As part of the Treaty of Paris, France gave up its claim to the colony; it instead negotiated to keep the small profitable island of Guadeloupe.Following the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada was renamed the Province of Quebec, and from 1774 extended from the coast of Labrador on the Atlantic Ocean, southwest through the Saint Lawrence River Valley to the Great Lakes and beyond to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Portions of its southwest, those areas south of the Great Lakes, were later ceded to the newly established United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783) at the conclusion of the American Revolution; although the British maintained a military presence there until 1796. In 1791, the territory north of the Great Lakes was reorganised and divided into Lower Canada and Upper Canada.\n\nHistory\nUnder the Proclamation, Quebec included the cities of Quebec and Montreal, as well as a zone surrounding them, but did not extend as far west as the Great Lakes or as far north as Rupert's Land.In 1774, the Parliament of Great Britain, Frederick North, Lord North, Prime Minister, passed the Quebec Act that allowed Quebec to restore the use of French customary law (Coutume de Paris) in private matters alongside the English common law system, and allowing the Catholic Church to collect tithes. The act also enlarged the boundaries of Quebec to include the Ohio Country and part of the Illinois Country, from the Appalachian Mountains on the east, south to the Ohio River, west to the Mississippi River and north to the southern boundary of lands owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, or Rupert's Land.\nPrince Edward  Duke of Kent lived in Quebec City \n(Known as the Prince of Quebec)from 1791-1793 this was when Michigan territory was a part of Quebec and a member of Parliament. \nDetroit was transferred to Quebec under the Quebec Act of 1774 . \nIt was then the third-largest city in the Province of Quebec, after Montreal and Quebec. 1792 Detroit, including settlements on both sides of the river, holds its first election, sending\nthree representatives to the Parliament of Upper Canada.\nThe Act Against Slavery, 1793, an anti-slavery act passed in Upper Canada. The Act was created partially in response to Loyalist refugees who brought slaves with them.\nMichigan Territory was a part of Upper Canada from 1790-1796  British control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of Kent County, Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now  Niagara-on-the-Lake). \nWestern District was one of four districts of the Province of Quebec created in 1788 in the western reaches of the Montreal District which were later detached in 1791 to create the new colony of Upper Canada. Known as Hesse District (named after Hesse in Germany) until 1792.\nThrough Quebec, the British Crown retained access to the Ohio and Illinois Countries after the Treaty of Paris (1783) ceded control of this land to the United States. By well-established trade and military routes across the Great Lakes, the British continued to supply not only their own troops but a wide alliance of Native American nations through Detroit, Fort Niagara, Fort Michilimackinac, and so on, until these posts were turned over to the United States following the Jay Treaty (1794).\nQuebec retained its seigneurial system after the conquest. Owing to an influx of Loyalist refugees from the American Revolutionary War, the demographics of Quebec came to shift and now included a substantial English-speaking Protestant element from the former Thirteen Colonies. These United Empire Loyalists settled mainly in the Eastern Townships, Montreal, and what was known then as the pays d'en haut west of the Ottawa River. The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the colony in two at the Ottawa River, so that the western part (Upper Canada) could be under the English legal system, with English speakers in the majority. The eastern part was named Lower Canada.\n\nGovernors\nIn 1760, following the capitulation of Montreal, the colony was placed under military government, with civil government only instituted beginning in 1764. The following were the governors:\n\nJames Murray 1760–1766\nGuy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester 1766–1778\nSir Frederick Haldimand 1778–1786\nGuy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester 1786–1796There were also \"lieutenant governors\", but these were merely the deputies of the governors, and should not be confused with the subsequent to 1791 Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec.\n\nGuy Carleton (lieutenant governor to James Murray)\t1766–1768\nHector Theophilus de Cramahé (lieutenant governor to Guy Carleton)\t1771–1782\nHenry Hamilton (lieutenant governor to Frederick Haldimand)\t1782–1785\nHenry Hope (lieutenant governor to the Lord Dorchester)\t1785–1788\nAlured Clarke (lieutenant governor to the Lord Dorchester)\t1790\n\nCounsellors to the governor\nThe Province of Quebec did not have an elected legislature and was ruled directly by the governor with advice from counsellors. A council responsible to advise the governor (then James Murray) on all affairs of state was created in 1764. In 1774, the Quebec Act created a Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec to advise the governor on legislative affairs. The Legislative Council served as an advisory council to the governor until a legislative assembly was established after 1791.\nThe individuals James Murray called into the council from 1764 to 1766:\n\nList of councillors under Carleton from 1766 to 1774:\n\nGeography\nAround 1763 to 1764, the province was divided into two judicial districts:\n\nMontreal District – covering the western parts of Quebec along the St. Lawrence River including Montreal and much of Ontario (Eastern and Southern Ontario)\nQuebec District – covering the eastern parts of Quebec along the St. Lawrence and LabradorIn 1790, the Trois-Rivières District was formed out of part of Quebec District.\nThe Trois-Rivières and Quebec districts continued after 1791 when Lower Canada came into existence, while Montreal District west of the Ottawa River became Upper Canada and east of the Ottawa River was partitioned into many electoral districts.\n\nSee also\nFormer colonies and territories in Canada\nTerritorial evolution of Canada after 1867\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

They also received the titles of excellentissimus vir' (most excellent man) and apostolic rector of Sant'Andrea, which Gregory received in 980. In 981, Gregory bore the title Romanorum consul, dux et senator: \"Consul, duke, and senator of the Romans.\"\nAs well as being an intimate and ally of the popes, especially Sylvester II, Gregory also served as praefectus navalis of Holy Roman Emperors Otto I and Otto II. However, on 6 February 1001, he was named \"Head of the Republic\" by the Romans for leading the revolt against Otto III and expelling the Crescentii. In 1002, the latter returned to power and he had to renounce his title.\nHis death is attested before the 11 June 1012, when his successor, Theophylact, was elected Pope.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBy his wife Maria (died 1013) he had three sons and a daughter:\n\nTheophylact, who became Pope Benedict VIII.\nAlberic III who succeeded him in Tusculum and in his titles.\nRomanus, who became Pope John XIX\nMarozia III, who married Thrasimund III of Spoleto. Together, the houses of Tusculum and Spoleto were the dominant secular powers in the central Italian peninsula, the one representative of the imperial power and the other, Gregory's, of papal.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPassage 3:\nAlberic II of Spoleto\nAlberic II (912–954) was ruler of Rome from 932 to 954, after deposing his mother Marozia and his stepfather, King Hugh of Italy.\nHe was of the house of the counts of Tusculum, the son of Marozia by her first husband, Duke Alberic I of Spoleto. His half-brother was Pope John XI. At the wedding of his mother to King Hugh of Italy, Alberic and his new stepfather quarreled violently after Hugh slapped Alberic for clumsiness. Infuriated by this and perhaps motivated by rumors that Hugh intended to have him blinded, Alberic left the festivities and incited a Roman mob to revolt against Hugh. In December 932 Hugh fled the city, Marozia was cast into prison, and Alberic took control of Rome.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 936 Alberic married his stepsister Alda, the daughter of King Hugh of Italy and had one son by her, Count Gregory I of Tusculum. According to Benedict of Soracte, he also had one illegitimate son, Octavianus, by an unknown mistress. On his deathbed Alberic had Roman nobility and clergy swear they would elect Octavianus as pope.\n\nSources\nWilliams, George L. (1998). Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes.

The bastard son, two grandsons, two great grandsons, and one great great grandson of Marozia—a rare genealogy—were seated in the Chair of St. Peter.\" Pope John XIII was her nephew, the offspring of her younger sister Theodora. From this description, the term \"pornocracy\" has become associated with the effective rule in Rome of Theodora and her daughter Marozia through male surrogates.\n\nEarly life\nMarozia was born about 890. She was the daughter of the Roman consul Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, and of Theodora, the real power in Rome, whom bishop Liutprand of Cremona characterized as a \"shameless whore... [who] exercised power on the Roman citizenry like a man.\"\nAt the age of fifteen, Marozia became the mistress of Theophylact's cousin Pope Sergius III, whom she knew when he was bishop of Portus. The two had a son, John (the later Pope John XI). That, at least, is the story found in two contemporary sources, the Liber Pontificalis and the Antapodosis sive Res per Europam gestae (958–62), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920–72). But a third contemporary source, the annalist Flodoard (c. inus of Bomarzo to act on his behalf, while Agapetus wrote to a number of bishops, asking them to be present at the council. Through his legate the pope indicated his support for King Louis IV of France, and gave his support for reinstalling Artald as bishop of Reims. This council was followed up by another one at Trier, where Agapetus was again represented by Marinus of Bomarzo. In 949, Agapetus held a synod in Rome, which confirmed the rulings of the two councils. It condemned the former bishop Hugh and it excommunicated his father, Count Herbert II of Vermandois, for his opposition to King Louis IV.After receiving requests from both Louis IV of France and Otto I of Germany, Agapetus granted privileges to monasteries and nunneries within their respective kingdoms. He also was sympathetic towards Otto's plans to restructure the bishoprics within Germany, which were eventually aborted due to pressure exerted by William of Mainz. Around 948, Agapetus, granted the Archbishop of Hamburg the right of consecrating bishops in Denmark and other northern European countries instead of the pope. The pope was also allegedly asked by a Danish king named Frode, now considered legendary, to send missionaries to his kingdom.Agapetus was also asked to intervene in a dispute between Herhold, archbishop of Salzburg and Gerard, bishop of Lauriacum, who both claimed the title of metropolitan of all Pannonia. Agapetus dispatched a letter to the two claimants, in which he stated that the diocese of Lauriacum had been the metropolitan church of all Pannonia before the invasion of the Huns. However, following the ravages inflicted by them, the metropolitan had transferred his see to another city, and since that time Salzburg had been raised to an archbishopric. Consequently, both lawfully occupied their respective sees, and both were to retain their rank and diocese. Agapetus ruled that jurisdiction over western Pannonia would rest with Herhold, while the eastern part, along with the regions occupied by the Avars and the Moravians, would fall under Gerard.In Italy, Agapetus wrote to the dukes of Beneventum and Capua, demanding that monasteries be returned to the monks whom they had displaced. He also deposed the bishops of Termoli and Trivento who were accused of simony. Hoping to rejuvenate the religious life of the clerics in Italy, Agapetus, with the blessing of Alberic, asked for the abbot of Gorze Abbey to send some of his monks down and join the monastic community attached to the church of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.Agapetus died on 8 November 955, and was succeeded by Alberic's son, Octavian, who took the papal name of John XII. He was buried in the Lateran basilica, behind the apse, and close to the tombs of Leo V and Paschal II. Agapetus was noted for his caution and for the sanctity with which he led his life.\nPassage 9:\nPope Leo VII\nPope Leo VII (Latin: Leo VII; died 13 July 939) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from 3 January 936 to his death.\n\nElection\nLeo VII's election to the papacy in 936, after the death of Pope John XI, was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time. Alberic wanted to choose the pope so that the papacy would continue to yield to his authority. Leo was the priest of the church of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk. He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.\n\nPontificate\nAs pope, Leo VII reigned for only three years. Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny. Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and King Hugh of Italy. Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh's daughter Alda and Alberic. Leo VII also appointed Archbishop Frederick of Mainz as a reformer in Germany. Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.Leo VII died on 13 July 939, and was interred at St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Stephen VIII.\nPassage 10:\nSimon, Count of Ponthieu\nSimon of Dammartin (1180 – 21 September 1239) was a son of Alberic III of Dammartin (Aubry de Dammartin) and his wife Mathildis of Clermont,  heiress to the county of Clermont and daughter of Renaud II, Count of Clermont.\n\nBiography\nSimon was the brother of Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, who had abducted the heiress of Boulogne, and forced her to marry him. It is thought that in order to strengthen the alliance with the Dammartins, King Philip Augustus of France allowed Simon to marry Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, who was a niece of the king, in 1208. Renaud and Simon of Dammartin would eventually ally themselves with John, King of England. In 1214 the brothers stood against Philip Augustus in the Battle of Bouvines. The French won the battle, and Renaud was imprisoned, while Simon was exiled.\nMarie's father William IV, Count of Ponthieu had remained loyal to Philip Augustus. When William died in 1221, Philip Augustus denied Marie her inheritance and gave Ponthieu in custody to his cousin Robert III, Count of Dreux. After the death of Philip Augustus, Marie was able to negotiate an agreement with his successor Louis VIII in 1225. Ponthieu was held by the king, and Simon would only be allowed to enter this or any other fief if he obtained royal permission. In 1231 Simon agreed to the terms and added that he would not enter into marriage negotiations for his daughters without consent of the king.\n\nFamily\nSimon married Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, the daughter of  William IV, Count of Ponthieu and Alys, Countess of the Vexin. Marie became Countess of Ponthieu in 1225.Simon and his wife Marie had four daughters:\n\nJoan, Countess of Ponthieu (1220–1278), married 1) Ferdinand III of Castile. Mother of Eleanor of Castile, the wife of Edward I of England. Married 2) Jean de Nesle, Seigneur de Falvy et de La Hérelle.\nMathilda of Dammartin (-1279), married John of Châtellerault\nPhilippe of Dammartin (-1280), married 1) Raoul II of Lusignan, 2) Raoul II, Lord of Coucy, 3) Otto II, Count of Guelders.\nMaria of Dammartin, married John II, Count of Roucy.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The population at the 2011 census was 11,894. It is a residential area with two minor industrial estates on either side of the main A56 Chester Road, which divides the two halves of the ward. Gorse Hill Park is a park which has recently had its historic main gates renovated and sits in between the two halves of the ward also, bridging Chester Road and Talbot Road. Gorse Hill is also the northernmost ward of Trafford council and is home to Trafford Town Hall, housing the council offices. Gorse Hill shares a border with the Clifford and Longford wards, and is town is home to two teams; both Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club.\nPassage 2:\nTrafford Bar tram stop\nTrafford Bar is a tram stop on Greater Manchester's light rail system, Metrolink, at the junction of Talbot Road and Seymour Grove in Old Trafford. It opened on 15 June 1992 as part of Phase 1 of Metrolink's expansion, before which it was a mainline railway station.\n\nHistory\nThe station was opened as Old Trafford on 20 July 1849 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&AR). It closed as a British Rail station on 24 December 1991, and the \"Old Trafford\" name was transferred to the former Warwick Road Station, to avoid confusion for passengers travelling to Old Trafford Football Ground and Old Trafford Cricket Ground. It was renamed Trafford Bar when it reopened as a Metrolink station on 15 June 1992.

It is one of the original high school rugby clubs which are part of the Georgia High School Rugby Association (GHSRA). The club was founded in 2005, and has made its mark on rugby in Georgia. Matches and practices are held at Noonday Creek Park in Marietta. Coach Randall Joseph has been the head coach since the club's founding, with John Green, Winston Daniels and Michael Murrell as assistant coaches. The club has taken park in many tournaments and state final matches in Georgia and the Southeast United States.  A major goal of the Trojans Rugby Football Club is to teach and play the sport of rugby in the United States. This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors. The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby. Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age. In the summer of 2011, the Trojan Rugby Football Club took part in another version of rugby called rugby sevens. This variation of rugby is faster paced, with the same size fields but fewer people, and shorter half lengths.\n\nLocation, practices and games\nNoonday Creek Park serves as the Trojans Rugby Football Club's home pitch. Although Lassiter High School is associated with the Trojans Rugby Football Club they do not permit the club to use fields at the school. Noonday Creek Park is located off Shallowford Rd., and at 489 Hawkins Store Rd., NE, Kennesaw, GA, 30144. The park has been part of high school rugby in Georgia since the first game was played there on March 4, 2005. Most practices and all home games for the Trojans take place at this park. Although Fall is the off season, practices currently occur every Wednesday at 4:45pm on field 13. During the formal spring season practices are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5pm and games are typically played on Friday nights.  When the park is closed, practices are held on the field at McCleskey Middle School, located at 4080 Maybreeze Road Marietta, Georgia, 30066.\n\nHistory\nThe Trojans Rugby Football Club began as one of the first three high school rugby teams in Georgia, in 2005. To create these teams the coaches got together and used the graduate thesis, \"The Bryant Model.\" This graduate thesis was written by Phillip C. Bryant, MBA, to provide a manual to starting a high school rugby club. After the first year the Trojans Rugby Football Club had earned a State Championship title for beating Pope High School's team 23-19. By the next season in 2006, the Georgia High School Rugby Association had created two divisions due to the increase in teams. The Trojan Rugby Football Club was placed in the Cobb County Division along with the Pope High School, the Sequoyah High School, and the Campbell High School Rugby Football Clubs. In the 2006 season, the Trojan Rugby Football Club lost all of their games to the other teams in the Cobb County Division. The club entered the 2007 season with growing numbers of new competition and notable performance. At the season's end the Trojans Rugby Football Club had an 11-1 record with the one loss coming from a defeat in the Southeast Tournament, by the Rummel Raiders Rugby Club of New Orleans, Louisiana. The club earned a second State Championship title after defeating the Alpharetta Phoenix Rugby Football Club, and participated in its first Southeast Tournament. In 2008, the club added to their success with yet another State Championship titleon English clubs in European competitions was lifted for the 1990–91 season, United were England's representatives in the European Cup Winners' Cup, as FA Cup winners, and they marked their return to Europe by winning the competition, with a 2–1 win over Barcelona (by now without Maradona) in the final, in which Mark Hughes scored twice. Their defence of the trophy in the 1991–92 season was short-lived, ending at the hands of Atlético Madrid in the second round, and they lost at the first hurdle in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup. League title glory in 1993 saw United enter the European Cup (now branded the Champions League) for the first time in 25 years, but in spite of their excellent domestic form during this era, they failed to make much of an impact in European competitions until the 1996–97 season, when they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and were beaten by Borussia Dortmund. This campaign in Europe also saw them suffer their first home defeat in a European competition, 40 years after first competing on the continent, losing 1–0 to Turkish side Fenerbahçe in the group stage.They finally ended a 31-year wait for a second European Cup in 1999 when stoppage-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær gave them a 2–1 win over Bayern Munich in the final in Barcelona. In 2003–04, United were beaten by Porto in the last 16 of the Champions League, ending a seven-year run of quarter-final appearances in the competitions, which also included one run to the final and a further two to the semi-finals.\nAfter three short-lived Champions League campaigns, United made an impact on the competition in the 2006–07 season. After going down 2–1 in Italy to Roma in the quarter-final first leg, they triumphed 7–1 in the second leg to reach the semi-finals for the first time in five years. They took a 3–2 lead against Milan in the first leg, only for their hopes of an all-English final with Liverpool to be ended by a 3–0 second leg defeat. A year later, however, they won the trophy for the third time, beating fellow English side Chelsea on penalties in Moscow after a 1–1 draw in the first all-English European Cup final.\n\nUnited reached a further two European Cup finals in the next three years, but lost to Barcelona on both occasions: first in the 2009 final in Rome, and then in the 2011 final at the new Wembley Stadium in London. Poor performances in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage saw United finish third, giving them another chance in Europe via the UEFA Europa League. This was the first time United entered the tournament since its rebrand from the UEFA Cup in 2009, in which they last competed in 1995–96. They were eventually knocked out in the round of 16, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Athletic Bilbao.\n\n2010s and 2020s: decline and resurgence\nAfter finishing seventh in the Premier League in 2013–14 under David Moyes, United missed out on European football in 2014–15 for the first time in 25 years, but returned to European action the following season after Moyes' replacement Louis van Gaal guided the club to fourth in the league and a place in the Champions League play-off round. It was the first time that Manchester United had played in the qualifying phase of the Champions League since beating Hungarian side Debrecen in the 2005–06 competition.By virtue of winning the 2015–16 FA Cup (compounded by a fifth-place finish in the Premier League that season), United started their 2016–17 European campaign in the Europa League, the first time since 1995–96. United won the tournament after defeating Ajax 2–0 in the final, giving them their first win of the competition and becoming the fifth club to win all three of UEFA's major titles. Underperformance in the league has led the club to another Europa League participations in 2019–20, in which United lost to Sevilla in the one-leg semi-final. In the 2020–21 Europa League they lost the final to Villarreal—their first major trophy; United qualified to the competition after a third-place finish in the 2020–21 Champions League group stage, a feat repeated from 2015–16. Since the club last won the league title in 2012–13, they are yet to qualify for the semi-finals of the Champions League. In the 2021–22 Champions League, the Reds topped their group but were knocked out in the round of 16 by Atlético Madrid, losing 1–2 on aggregate. As a result of a sixth-place finish in the 2021–22 Premier League, Manchester United were again qualified for the 2022-23 Europa League. United performed well in the competition, beating Barcelona in the Round of 32 play-offs, but were knocked out by Sevilla 5-2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals.\n\nMatches\nOverall record\nBy competition\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nBy country\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nBy club\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nHonours\nEuropean\nEuropean Cup / UEFA Champions League:\nWinners (3): 1967–68, 1998–99, 2007–08\nRunners-up (2): 2008–09, 2010–11\nUEFA Europa League:\nWinners (1): 2016–17\nRunners-up (1): 2020–21\nUEFA Cup Winners' Cup:\nWinners (1): 1990–91\nUEFA Super Cup:\nWinners (1) 1991\nRunners-up (3): 1999, 2008, 2017\n\nWorldwide\nIntercontinental Cup:\nWinners (1): 1999\nRunners-up (1): 1968\nFIFA Club World Cup:\nWinners (1): 2008\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nRagbi Klub Mornar Bar\nRagbi Klub Mornar Bar (Montenegrin:Рагби клуб Морнар Бар, English: Rugby Club Mornar Bar) is a Montenegrin rugby club based in Bar, Montenegro.

Critics agree that in this, Tyler's 18th novel, the author again treads familiar territory by setting her novel in Baltimore and by following the life of an inconspicuous man who has never realised his full potential.\n\nPlot summary\nOn the surface, Liam Pennywell leads an ordered, decent life. Once widowed and once divorced, with three grown-up daughters, he has just been dismissed from his teaching job and, for lack of funds, has moved to a smaller apartment on the outskirts of Baltimore. Toying with the idea of retiring altogether rather than going job hunting at his age, Pennywell is assaulted by a burglar on the very first night he stays at his new place. When he wakes up in hospital with a bandaged head, he cannot remember a thing about the attack.\nThe loss of memory disturbs him more than the crime itself. In a neurologist's waiting room he observes 38-year-old Eunice accompanying an ageing entrepreneur to his doctor's appointment and finds out that she is working for him as a \"rememberer\" or, as she herself puts it later, the old man's \"external hard drive.\" Intrigued by this occupation, Pennywell contrives a chance encounter with her, and eventually they strike up a relationship with each other.\nComplications in their love affair arise when his youngest daughter, 17-year-old Kitty, decides to move in with him, obviously because she expects to be enjoying more freedom than if she stayed with her mother; and when his middle daughter Louise makes a habit of dumping his four-year-old grandson Jonah at Pennywell's apartment for him to babysit. On top of that, Eunice turns out to be a married woman who, after Pennywell has found out, still does not want to let go of him.\nIn the end the police arrest the burglar—a juvenile delinquent whose mother has the cheek to ask Pennywell to serve as a character witness at her son's forthcoming trial. By then, Pennywell has made up with his eldest daughter Xanthe, who was bearing an old grudge against her father, has got rid of Eunice, and has got settled in at his new apartment. Also, he has started working as a zayde for Jewish preschool children.\n\nTitle\nThe novel takes its title from a discussion Pennywell has with his grandson about whether Noah was steering his ark, or just bobbing up and down in the flood. \"Noah didn't need to figure out directions, because the whole world was underwater and so it made no difference,\" he tells Jonah. “There wasn't anywhere to go. He was just trying to stay afloat.\"\n\nReviews\nWilliam Boot: \"Do I Have to Read Noah's Compass?\", www.thedailybeast.com (23 January 2010).\nKathleen Byrne: \"Families, They Suck You Up\",  The Globe and Mail (29 January 2010).\nElizabeth Day: \"Anne Tyler's Noah's Compass, The Observer (16 August 2009).\nKathryn Harrison: \"The Memory Thief\", The New York Times (3 January 2010) BR10.\nYvonne Zipp: \"Noah's Compass\", The Christian Science Monitor (5 January 2010).\nLinks to more reviews at  www.reviewsofbooks.com.\n\nSee also\n2009 in literature\nPassage 2:\nStanley Elkin\nStanley Lawrence Elkin (May 11, 1930 – May 31, 1995) was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist. His extravagant, satirical fiction revolves around American consumerism, popular culture, and male-female relationships.\n\nBiography\nElkin was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Chicago from age three onwards. He did both his undergraduate and graduate work at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, receiving a bachelor's degree in English in 1952 and a Ph.D. in 1961 for his dissertation on William Faulkner. During this period he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957. In 1953 Elkin married Joan Marion Jacobson. He was a member of the English faculty at Washington University in St. Louis from 1960 until his death, and battled multiple sclerosis for most of his adult life. In 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.During his career, Elkin published ten novels, two volumes of novellas, two books of short stories, a collection of essays, and one (unproduced) screenplay. Elkin's work revolves about American pop culture, which it portrays in innumerable darkly comic variations. Characters and especially prose style take full precedence over plot. His language is extravagant and exuberant, baroque and flowery, taking fantastic flight from his characters' endless patter. \"He was like a jazz artist who would go off on riffs,\" said critic William Gass. In a review of George Mills, Ralph B. Sipper wrote, \"Elkin's trademark is to tightrope his way from comedy to tragedy with hardly a slip.\" About the influence of ethnicity on his work Elkin said he admired most \"the writers who are stylists, Jewish or not.

What I go for in my work is language.\"\nAlthough living in the Midwest, Elkin spent his childhood and teenage summers in a bungalow colony called West Oakland, on the Ramapo River in northern New Jersey not far from Mahwah, the home of Joyce Kilmer. This was a refuge for a close-knit group of several score families, mostly Jewish, from the summer heat of New York City and urban New Jersey. Elkin's writings placed in New Jersey were informed by this experience.Elkin won the National Book Critics Circle Award on two occasions: for George Mills in 1982 and for Mrs. Ted Bliss, his last novel, in 1995. The MacGuffin was a finalist for the 1991 National Book Award for Fiction. However, although he enjoyed high critical praise, his books have never enjoyed popular success. The 1976 Jack Lemmon film Alex & the Gypsy was based on Elkin's novella \"The Bailbondsman\".\nElkin died May 31, 1995, of a heart attack, twenty days after his 65th birthday. His manuscripts and correspondence are archived in Olin Library at Washington University in St. Louis. Elkin's literary legacy is represented by the literary agency07.\nPassage 9:\nMrs. Ted Bliss\nMrs. Ted Bliss is a 1995 novel by American author Stanley Elkin, published by Hyperion Books. It concerns the last eventful years in the life of an old widow. Elkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for this work.\n\nPlot\nMrs. Dorothy Bliss is an old woman in her early 80s living alone in a retirement community near Miami Beach, Florida, after her husband's death due to cancer. She was born in Russia and is Jewish. Her mother bribed an immigration officer and added three years to her age on legal documents in order that she could start working in Manhattan's Lower East Side after their immigration. Her husband, Ted Bliss, had a butcher shop in Chicago and together they had three kids. Her oldest son dies of cancer at a young age and after her husband's retirement, the couple moved to Florida. She is obsessed with cleaning and also keeps records of the gifts given to her grandchildren in order to keep track and stay impartial with everyone.The single life of Mrs. Bliss is now filled with expectations of finding a romance or a partner but eventually she is disappointed and heartbroken. She gets involved with Alcibiades Chitral, a drug lord who operates in her neighborhood, and starts using her and her husband's car as a front for his activities. The story keeps introducing various new men in her life, such as Hector Camerando, a jai alai pro who helps Mrs. Bliss with some tips on dogs, and Tommy Auveristas, an imposter. Junior Yellin, a once upon a time lover with whom Mrs. Bliss had had a passionate encounter in her husband's butcher shop, also makes a re-entry into her life. She eventually dies when Hurricane Andrew hits Miami and brings massive destruction.\n\nPublication\nFollowing Elkin's death on 31 May 1995 at age 65, the novel was released posthumously on 7 September 1995. Elkin had published ten novels, five short-story collections, and various novellas and non-fiction articles in various magazines and papers during the course of his writing career, which began in the 1950s.\n\nReview and reception\nKirkus Reviews writes that Elkin makes readers believe that the novel has a plot when drug dealers are introduced in it. However, \"there isn't so much a plot as an accumulation of detail about Mrs. Bliss\". Elkin's \"long poetic sentences about seemingly mundane minutiae\" later bring substance to the character of Mrs. Bliss. Walter Goodman, a television critic for The New York Times, mentions in his review that \"[the book] may not be Stanley Elkin's best, but it is a smart, generous, melancholy, funny, even elegiac work by a prodigious practitioner\". Publishers Weekly writes that \"Elkin is at his best here, blessed with the gift of one-liner insight and a definite, if reluctantly exercised, ability to tug on a reader's heartstrings\".\n\nAwards\nElkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. The book was nominated along with Independence Day (by Richard Ford),  Galatea 2.2 (by Richard Powers), Moo (by Jane Smiley), and The Tent of Orange Mist (by Paul West). Elkin had earlier won in the same category for his 1982 novel George Mills.\nPassage 10:\nGeorge Mills (novel)\nGeorge Mills is a 1982 novel by American author Stanley Elkin, published by E. P. Dutton. The novel, set in five parts, tells the family history of succeeding generations of characters named George Mills. The story covers more than 1,000 years from the First Crusade in Europe to the Ottoman Empire to present-day America. Elkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. Elkin mentioned George Mills as one of his favorite novels. The novel is considered Elkin's \"longest and most complexly organized work\".: 189\n\nPlot\nThe first George Mills sets out on a journey with his lord on the First Crusade. But he eventually gets lost in the Netherlands and reaches a salt mine in Poland. His lord at the mines is Guillalume, who teaches him some life lessons. Mills becomes aware of what is written in his fate and this helps him understand the walks of life in this world in a better manner. Despite having the knowledge of what would happen in the future, his timidity and powerlessness does not bring out any situation-changing effects. \nThe novel covers the history of succeeding family members named George Mills and all of them are aware of their fates and equally feeble and ineffective in changing their circumstances. The 43rd Mills encounters King George IV and is assigned on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, where he first joins the Janissaries but later ends up in the Ottoman Sultan's harem doing household chores. He escapes from there and reaches America. The present-day Mills in America is a caretaker of an old woman named Judith Glazer in St. Louis, who is in the final stages of terminal cancer. Mills accompanies Glazer to Mexico and upon her death participates in her funeral together with her family.\n\nPublication\nElkin worked for over seven years writing George Mills and by the end of its completion, he felt exhausted and insisted this would be his last fictional work. But after watching a British news report of how terminally ill children had a memorable experience at Disneyland, he wrote his next novel, The Magic Kingdom (1985), and dedicated it to his son who had died young from a medical ailment after lengthy treatments.George Mills was published on 25 October 1982. In 1989, Elkin mentioned that several sections of George Mills had been adapted from the 1936 novel Absalom, Absalom! by William Faulkner. He also mentioned that in writing the novel, he came to realise \"that I was a novelist, that anything I say is a part of this novel is a part of this novel\".: 194\n\nReview and reception\nKirkus Reviews called the novel \"a leaky collection of parts rather than one whole strong book\" but said it was required reading for connoisseurs of comic fiction. The New York Times reviewer Leslie Epstein complimented \"the novel's fine writing, flashes of humor and memorable heroine\", but felt that the plot was \"out of control\". Brad Owens of The Christian Science Monitor praised the novel for its \"energetic entertainment\" and said that it \"sometimes overpowers its more serious intentions\".\n\nAwards\nElkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel.  The novel was nominated along with Levitation: Five Fictions (by Cynthia Ozick), Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant (by Anne Tyler),  The Color Purple (by Alice Walker), and Shiloh and Other Stories (by Bobbie Ann Mason). Elkin also won the award in 1995 for his novel Mrs. Ted Bliss.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAverill Park, New York\nAverill Park is a census-designated place within the town of Sand Lake in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 2,098 at the 2020 census.\nThe community is named after the local Averill family. It is located on Route 43, south of Crystal Lake and east of West Sand Lake.\nThe Sand Lake Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\n\nDemographics\nHistory\nOriginally known only as part of greater Sand Lake, the community along with neighboring towns grew with the nineteenth-century development of wool and cotton textile manufacturing by local watermills and knitting factories along the Wynants Kill tributary of the Hudson River. By the 1880s, several independent local mills produced hosiery, undergarments, and knit shirts.The hamlet was named Averill in 1880 after a local leading family, then in 1882 renamed Averill Park in promotion of local summer-resort development and of the Troy & New England Railway, a never-completed trolley and freight line intended to connect the city of Troy, New York with the mills and summer resorts of Averill Park and its “upstate Coney Island” recreational Crystal Lake Beach, and with the mills of the neighboring town of West Sand Lake.The local mills declined after the increasing efficiency of steam and electrical power improved competition from regional factories, and were then destroyed by a 1891 river flood. The Faith Knitting Company (later Faith Mills), founded in 1897, restored local industry by buying and re-equipping the old mills and rehiring local labor. Other late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century firms included Jake Warger’s Dry Goods Store; Gilbert Beebe’s blacksmith shop; Stout’s Hardware; and Park Pharmacy, where Jerry Lewis worked as a soda jerk in 1942 when his father was a superintendent at Faith Mills.Mid-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century seasonal hotels included Al’s Place, Hilke’s Averill Park Hotel (previously housing Scram’s Collegiate Institute), Traveler’s Rest (aka Sand Lake House, Tillotson’s Hotel, and Wagner’s Hotel), the Lake View Hotel (aka Blake’s and the Gabler Hotel, later housing the Averill Park Female Seminary), and Clum’s. For mill workers and townspeople, Faith Mills’s Clubhouse was “the entertainment center of the town for many years,” complete with dance hall, motion picture parlor, cafeteria, bowling alleys, pocket billiard room, and shower room.Faith Mills’s decline, and with it that of Averill Park, began in the Great Depression, during which local textile mills did not regain business till 1932. During World War II, manufacture of wool blankets and long woolen underwear for the military earned Faith Mills four rare “excellence in production” Army-Navy \"E\" Awards.From 1955 to 1962, Faith Mills, by then one of only three remaining U.S. manufacturers of woolen long underwear “considered obsolete by most persons” as the market shifted to cotton undergarments, was sold to holding companies and downsized to one factory in Averill Park employing as few as 54 workers, finally closing in 1962. In 1965, the factory was to manufacture a “floor-sweeping compound” and become a warehouse for corrugated shipping containers, employing 15 workers.\n\n2010 demographics\nAs of the census of 2010, The racial makeup of the CDP was 85.4% White, 6.5% African American, 4.1% Asian, and 4.0% from two or more races.

The race was contested over 90 laps at Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Alabama. It was the 7th time that the IndyCar Series had raced on the circuit. In qualifying, Simon Pagenaud took pole position with a time of 1:06.7762, beating out his teammate Will Power. Sébastien Bourdais set a new track record during the second round of qualifications with a time of 1:06.6001, but was unable to match that pace in the third round of qualifying, relegating him to a fifth place start. Championship contender Juan Pablo Montoya struggled heavily in qualifying, placing 21st and last.The race opened with an incident before it even started. As the field came off the final turn to prepare to take the green flag, Carlos Muñoz tipped Mikhail Aleshin into a spin, sending Aleshin and Jack Hawksworth off into the outside grass. All involved escaped major damage, while the rest of the field ran an extra lap under yellow before the start. It would be the only caution flag of the day. Simon Pagenaud held the lead when the race started, with Power slotting in behind him. Further back in the field, Sébastien Bourdais and Scott Dixon made contact in turn five, sending Dixon into a spin and causing front wing damage to Bourdais' car. Both would continue, but their races were both greatly hampered due to the incident.Pagenaud dominated the majority of the race. However, in the closing laps, Pagenaud was held up in lap traffic, allowing Graham Rahal to catch up and set a thrilling duel for the lead. On lap 82, Rahal and Pagenaud made contact entering turn seven, sending Pagenaud off course and handing Rahal the lead. The lead would be short lived, as four laps later, Pagenaud caught back up and attempted to make a pass at the exit of turn six. In the middle of the move, Rahal made contact with back-marker Jack Hawksworth, damaging Rahal's front wing and ending any chance of holding off Pagenaud. Pagenaud would extend his lead and take victory by 13.7 seconds. It was Pagenaud second consecutive victory of the season. Despite his damaged wing, Rahal managed to hang on and finish second. Josef Newgarden finished third. Despite his terrible starting position, Juan Pablo Montoya was able to charge through the field and finish in a respectable fifth place.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSchorle\nSchorle is a German beverage made by diluting juice or wine with carbonated water or lemonade (lemon-lime soda). The most common variety is Apfelschorle (made from apple juice and sparkling mineral water). Large bottles of Schorle can be found at most grocers, stores, supermarkets and anywhere else where carbonated drinks are sold, next to the soda. Due to its dilution it is less sweet or alcoholic than the original beverage, making it better suited as a refreshment on hot summer days or as an alternative to beer at the biergarten or weinstube.\nTypical proportions are half seltzer in a high glass and half juice or wine. In the Palatinate, in Germany, a wine schorle may consist of considerably less than 1/2 water if it is ordered 'fett' (German for 'fat').\n\nVarieties\nThere is no specific word for Schorle in the English language. However, Spritzer is very similar with the slight difference of Schorle typically being a freshly mixed drink and not usually sold in cans or bottles as spritzers sometimes are.\nSchorle, Spritzer and Gespritzter are all expressions for similar variations of Schorle:\n\nWine with mineral watersour Schorle (“Schorle sauer”), sour spritzed Schorle (“Sauergespritzter”)\nin Austria: white/red spritzed or simply spritzer (“Gespritzter” or “G’spritzter”)Wine with lemonadesweet Schorle which is also known as the “Arbeitersekt” which can be translated as “worker’s sparkling wine”Wine with Cola”Cola-Schoppen”\nin Austria: red Cola or white ColaJuice with mineral water”Juice-Schorle”, “Fruit-Schorle” or “Fruit-Juice-Schorle”\nin Austria: spritzed apple juice, spritzed orange juice etc.Schorle (usually with the female German article “die”, but in Baden-Württemberg typically with the neutral German article “das” or male German article “der” and in the Palatinate area with the male German article “der” as well) is very popular as a refreshment especially in summer. The mixing proportions are mostly approximately 1:1 but in case of Schorle with juice the proportions are usually unbalanced and there is often far more mineral water in the drink.\n\nOrigin of the Term Schorle\nAccording to the Duden dictionary of etymology, the word Schorlemorle, which occurred first as Schurlemurle in Lower Bavaria, is since the 18th century a designation for a mixed drink consisting of wine and sparkling mineral water. The origin of the word is uncertain; perhaps it is due to a play on words, similar to that in the 16th century, where the designations for beer, scormorrium in Münster and Murlepuff in Strasbourg, could be ascertained. The Southern German word Schurimuri, which dates from the 16th century and means “excited, hectic”, and the older Low German word Schurrmurr, which means “mishmash”, might be related to it.According to Kluge, the word Schorlemorle, however, is probably based upon the vernacular Southern German word schuren, which means \"to bubble\" or \"to fizz\".\nIn an article of the Südwest Presse, Henning Petershagen lists also other attempts to interpret the origin of this word, for example a linguistic relationship to the Dutch term schorriemorrie, which means \"ragtag\" or \"rabble\".\nThe digitale bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse letteren provides evidence that the word originates from the Persian-Turkish schurmur which means \"confusion, turmoil\" and is similarly present in Albanian, Serbian, Slovenian and Russian, up to the Spanish churriburri. The latter can be found in the dictionary of the royal-Spanish Academy as zurriburri (\"muddle\", \"base subject\", \"plebs\"). Schorle is said to have formed thus; the oriental schurimuri came to Europe with its original meaning \"muddle\" where it was established as a character denotation (also as family name) and as a term to refer to the beverage-muddle.\n\nMixing with Wine\nGermany\nSchorle made with fruit juice is subject to the order on the regulation of fruit and soft drinks (cf. Fruchtsaft- und Erfrischungsgetränkeverordnung).\n\nWeinschorle (wine spritzer)\nWine is the basis of „wine schorle“ or “wine spritzer“. Preferred wine varieties are Riesling (Riesling schorle / Riesling spritzer), Blauer Portugieser, vin gris, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner or other red wine.  Depending on what the wine is mixed with, a wine schorle is called “sour” when it is prepared with carbonated water, “sweet” when prepared with carbonated lemonade, or also “sweet and sour” when made with both mineral water and lemonade.\nIn the Palatinate, the ratio of wine is often much larger; depending on the waiting staff, the glass is filled almost completely with wine and diluted with only a spritzer of water, especially in wine bars and at wine festivals. In the Palatinate, schorle is traditionally served in a special glass that holds 0.5 liters, a Palatinate pint glass. A regional term for this glass is “Dubbeglas”.\nSimilarly to schorle, wine is sometimes mixed with cola: red cola and white cola, meaning cola mixed with red or white wine respectively.\n\nGespritzter\nSchorle is also called Gespritzter in some areas of Germany but this doesn’t always mean the same thing:\nIn Hesse ‘Gespritzer’ stands for a 2:1, sometimes even a 3:1 mixture of apple wine and sparkling water. At traditional apple wine pubs, this mixture is only served in corrugated apple wine glasses. Today it is also known as Sauergespritzter, so that it can be differentiated from ‘Süßgespritzten’, which is made with Lemonade.\nIn Rheinhessen a ‘Gespritzter’ or ‘sauer Gespritzter’ is a mixture made out of white wine or red wine together with sparkling water. In addition, there are also mixtures with cola or Lemonade.\nIn Bavaria and Austria 'Gespritzter' basically refers to the same drink.\n\nAustria\nAccording to §3 of the German Weinbezeichnungsverordnung, which is a decree for the labelling of wine, a G'spritzter (also Gespritzter, Spritzer) is a drink mixed with at least 50% wine and 50% soda or mineral water at the most. The drink itself has to contain at least 4.5 % per vol. of alcohol. The name Schorle is unusual in Austria.\nColloquially the expression Sommerspritzer or Sommergespritzter is used for a mixture with less wine and Winterspritzer for a mixture with more wine.\nThereA study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2013 concluded that consumption of soft drinks was associated with a 23% higher risk of developing kidney stones.\n\nMortality, circulatory and digestive diseases\nIn a 2019 study, 451,743 people who had higher consumption of soft drinks (two or more a day) were associated with mortality, artificially sweetened drinks with cardiovascular diseases and sugar-sweetened drinks with digestive diseases.\n\nGovernment regulation\nSchools\nSince at least 2006, debate on whether high-calorie soft drink vending machines should be allowed in schools has been on the rise. Opponents of the soft drink vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents also argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. A 2011 bill to tax soft drinks in California failed, with some opposing lawmakers arguing that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's drink choices.On May 3, 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Cadbury Schweppes, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and the American Beverage Association announced new guidelines that will voluntarily remove high-calorie soft drinks from all U.S. schools.\nOn May 19, 2006, the British education secretary, Alan Johnson, announced new minimum nutrition standards for school food. Among a wide range of measures, from September 2006, school lunches will be free from carbonated drinks. Schools will also end the sale of junk food (including carbonated drinks) in vending machines and tuck shops.\nIn 2008, Samantha K Graff published an article in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science regarding the \"First Amendment Implications of Restricting Food and Beverages Marketing in Schools\". The article examines a school district's policy regarding limiting the sale and marketing of soda in public schools, and how certain policies can invoke a violation of the First Amendment. Due to district budget cuts and loss in state funding, many school districts allow commercial businesses to market and advertise their product (including junk food and soda) to public school students for additional revenue. Junk food and soda companies have acquired exclusive rights to vending machines throughout many public school campuses. Opponents of corporate marketing and advertising on school grounds urge school officials to restrict or limit a corporation's power to promote, market, and sell their product to school students. In the 1970s, the Supreme Court ruled that advertising was not a form of free expression, but a form of business practices which should be regulated by the government. In the 1976 case of Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, the Supreme Court ruled that advertising, or \"commercial speech\", to some degree is protected under the First Amendment. To avoid a First Amendment challenge by corporations, public schools could create contracts that restrict the sale of certain product and advertising. Public schools can also ban the selling of all food and drink products on campus, while not infringing on a corporation's right to free speech.On December 13, 2010, President Obama signed the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 (effective in 2014) that mandates schools that receive federal funding must offer healthy snacks and drinks to students. The act bans the selling of soft drinks to students and requires schools to provide healthier options such as water, unflavored low-fat milk, 100% fruit and vegetable drinks or sugar-free carbonated drinks. The portion sizes available to students will be based on age: eight ounces for elementary schools, twelve ounces for middle and high schools. Proponents of the act predict the new mandate it will make it easier for students to make healthy drink choices while at school.In 2015, Terry-McElarth and colleagues published a study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school drink availability and student consumption. The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014–2015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy drinks at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.\n\nTaxation\nIn the United States, legislators, health experts and consumer advocates are considering levying higher taxes on the sale of soft drinks and other sweetened products to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption. Others say that taxes should help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption. The food and drink industry holds considerable clout in Washington, DC, as it has contributed more than $50 million to legislators since 2000.In January 2013, a British lobby group called for the price of sugary fizzy drinks to be increased, with the money raised (an estimated £1 billion at 20p per litre) to be put towards a \"Children's Future Fund\", overseen by an independent body, which would encourage children to eat healthily in school.In 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain imposed a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks to curb excess consumption of the commodity and for additional revenue.\n\nAttempted ban\nIn March 2013, New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed to ban the sale of non-diet soft drinks larger than 16 ounces, except in convenience stores and supermarkets. A lawsuit against the ban was upheld by a state judge, who voiced concerns that the ban was \"fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences\". Bloomberg announced that he would be appealing the verdict. The state appellate courts upheld the trial court decision, and the ban remains unenforceable as of 2021.\n\nSee also\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

He and his wife, Sharon, were the parents of four children, along with three grandchildren.Leach was atypical among NCAA Division I head coaches in that he did not play college football.Famous among fans for his fascination with 18th-century pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack, Leach lectured his players on the history of pirates, and told them before games to \"swing their swords.\" His office had been described as a museum of pirate paraphernalia. Notably, his office at Washington State included a life-size statue of a singing pirate, a gift from basketball coaching legend Bob Knight, who had coached at Texas Tech for most of Leach's tenure at that school. In particular, Leach admired the teamwork exhibited by pirates:\nPirates function as a team. There were a lot of castes and classes in England at the time. But with pirates, it didn't matter if you were black, white, rich or poor. The object was to get a treasure. If the captain did a bad job, you could just overthrow him.\nLeach spent time during each off-season pursuing non-sport interests. Besides pirates, he had studied topics such as Native American leader Geronimo, American pioneer Daniel Boone, grizzly bears, chimpanzees, whales, and American artist Jackson Pollock.Leach made a cameo appearance on the TV series Friday Night Lights. In the show's fourth season, he portrayed a \"random loon\" at a gas station who implores a despondent coach Eric Taylor to \"swing your sword\" and \"find your inner pirate.\"During the spring of 2019, Leach co-taught a five-week seminar at Washington State, \"Insurgent Warfare and Football Strategies,\" alongside Washington politician Michael Baumgartner.\n\nDeath\nOn December 11, 2022, Leach experienced an undisclosed health issue and was hospitalized in Jackson, Mississippi. That evening, Sports Illustrated reporter Ross Dellenger reported that Leach was in critical condition. The Clarion-Ledger reported that Leach had suffered a massive heart attack and had not received medical attention for 10 to 15 minutes, and had also suffered seizures that may have contributed to brain damage as a result. He died the following day at the age of 61.

The Bears won their next two games against Stephen F. Austin and Rice at home, before traveling to Kansas State where they lost a tightly contested game 35–36 to the greatly improved Bill Snyder-coached team.  After defeating Iowa State 49–26 at home, the Bears finished October losing two straight on the road at Texas A&M and eventual conference champion Oklahoma State.The Bears rebounded to finish the regular season with five straight victories including a Homecoming win over Missouri, a 31–30 overtime victory at Kansas in which Baylor tied a school record by overcoming a 21-point deficit in the 4th quarter, and the program's first win over then #5 Oklahoma on a 34-yard touchdown pass from Griffin to Terrance Williams with 8 seconds remaining in the game. Baylor concluded November in Dallas playing against Texas Tech in Cowboys Stadium; although Griffin left the game due to a concussion at the half, backup Nick Florence entered the game to lead the Bears to a 66–42 victory. Baylor's win over Texas Tech was their first since 1995.The Bears finished the regular season at home with a 48–24 victory over then #22 Texas that propelled the team (9–3, 6–3 Big 12) to the Alamo Bowl with #12 and #15 BCS and AP rankings respectively. The victory also propelled quarterback Robert Griffin III to the top of the Heisman Trophy voting; he became the first Baylor player to win the award and the first Baylor player since Don Trull in 1963 to factor significantly in the voting.\n\nSchedule\n^A Game was called at the end of the 3rd quarter due to lightning.\n\nGame summaries\nMissouri\nOklahoma\nBaylor's first victory over Oklahoma in school history.\n\nTexas Tech\nRobert Griffin III was knocked out just before halftime with a concussion.\n\nTexas\n2011 Alamo Bowl\nOn December 4, 2011, Baylor accepted an invite to represent the Big-12 in the 2011 Alamo Bowl. Their opponents were the Washington Huskies of the Pac-12. The game was played at the Alamodome.  The crowd of 65,256 represented the 5th largest attendance in the history of the bowl game. A very good showing since the highest ever attendance at an Alamo bowl was only 66,100 which was set several years before.  The Bowl officials stated it was also the most exciting college football game ever witnessed at the Bowl.\nThe contest became the second-highest scoring bowl game in history, and the highest-scoring regulation bowl game ever. Baylor went up 21–7 early in the game, with Griffin throwing for one touchdown and rushing for another. The Huskies roared back with 28 unanswered points, and the teams finished the half with Washington leading 35–24. In the second half, with the defenses showing limited ability to cope with the high-powered offenses led by Griffin and Husky QB Keith Price, the teams traded scores. The Bears overcame the halftime deficit, going ahead for good 60–56 halfway in the 4th quarter, and Baylor RB Terrance Ganaway tacked on a final 43-yard touchdown run with 2:28 left to play. Ganaway finished with 21 carries for 200 yards and 5 TDs, and was recognized as the game's offensive MVP. The victory represented Baylor's first bowl win since a victory in the John Hancock (Sun) Bowl in 1992. With the win, Baylor had their first 10-win season since 1980.\n\nAwards and honors\nDavey O'Brien Award: Robert Griffin III\nHeisman Trophy: Robert Griffin III\nAP Player of the Year: Robert Griffin III\nSporting News Player of the Year: Robert Griffin III\n\nRankings\nPassage 2:\n2010 Connecticut Huskies football team\nThe 2010 Connecticut Huskies football team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season as a member of the Big East Conference. The team was coached by Randy Edsall and played its home games at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut. The Huskies finished 8–5, 5–2 in Big East play to share the conference title with Pittsburgh and West Virginia. Due to victories over both schools, the Huskies earned the Big East's automatic bid to a BCS game, and were invited to the Fiesta Bowl where they were defeated by Big 12 champion Oklahoma 48–20.  It was the first major-bowl appearance in the program's 115-year history.\n\nPrevious season\nThe 2009 team finished with a record of 8–5, 3–4 in Big East play and won the PapaJohns.com Bowl 20–7 against South Carolina.\n\nBefore the season\nCoaching changes\nConnecticut lost two assistant coaches in January, when the tight ends coach, Dave McMichael left to accept the same position at West Virginia, and defensive backs coach, Scott Lakatos, left for the same position at Georgia.\nOn February 4, UConn announced that Jon Wholley would return to the coaching staff as the tight ends coach, and Darrell Perkins would assume the defensive backs coaching position.\n\nRoster changes\nThe Huskies lost eight starters from the 2009 team to graduation.

On 4th down from the UW 4-yard line, Beaver quarterback Ryan Katz's pass for John Reese fell to the turf in the end zone. The Huskies stormed the field, only then to realize a late flag from back judge Johnny Jenkins was for pass interference against the Huskies' Desmond Trufant.\nJacquizz Rodgers then scored from the 2 on the next play to pull Oregon State to 35-34. Beavers coach Mike Riley called timeout and decided to go for two. But Katz's throw fell out of Joe Halahuni's hands as he was hit by linebacker Cort Dennison and Washington's celebration was on again.\nWashington snapped a six-game losing streak to the Beavers.\n\nArizona\nStanford\nOregon\nUCLA\nCalifornia\nWashington scored from the one-yard line without time left in the regulation to defeat Cal and took the Golden Bears out of a bowl game.

The original running time of 120 minutes was also shortened to 90, and the programme was finally broadcast in one instalment in May 2008. The drama was produced by BBC Northern Ireland and shot in Bristol. A DVD was released in Sweden in 2010, but as of 2016, has not been released in the UK. Viewing figures of 3.9 million did not prove strong enough for a full series to be commissioned.\n\nSynopsis\nA plot synopsis issued by the BBC in a press release read as follows: \"In this drama, a killer has killed once and kidnapped another victim, challenging the investigative and forensic team to work out why. Suddenly everyone's past comes under scrutiny, everyone's version of the truth comes under suspicion. Kay Rousseau (Louise Lombard), who heads up the crime team, is back at work after the death of her child. Suspicion about her involvement in this death remains, not least in her own husband. Only Matt Costello (Danny Dyer), Kay's second-in-command and a dedicated, impassioned copper, is loyal to the core. Dr. George Austen (Lyndsey Marshal), the team's forensic scientist, worked on Kay's case and knows things Kay wished she didn't, and this isn't helped by her own fast increasing addiction to alcohol which puts her evidential work under unwelcome scrutiny.\nDr Clive Morrell (Shaun Parkes) is a profiler whose own mood swings and strange behaviour are causing concern within the team. Jude Whiley (Lenora Crichlow) is a rookie cop, who is young, fresh and has an energy and passion for the job that verges on obsession. Miles Trumeman (Ace Bhatti) plays Kay's husband Miles Trueman, who is a lawyer attached to the case. Brian McCardie plays killer Michael Bovery, a man obsessed with one of the team, and Jeffery Kissoon plays Commissioner Wilson, Rousseau's boss.\"\n\nCast\nLouise Lombard as Superintendent Kay Rousseau\nDanny Dyer as Detective Inspector Matt Costello\nLenora Crichlow as Detective Constable Jude Whiley\nLyndsey Marshal as Dr. George Austen, pathologist\nShaun Parkes as Dr. Clive Morrell, profiler\nAce Bhatti as Miles Trueman, lawyer\nCaroline O'Hara as Jane, kidnap and rape victim\nNeil McDermott as John, kidnap victim\nPerry Benson as The Courier\nBrian McCardie as Michael Bovery\nJeffery Kissoon as Commissioner Wilson\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nKiss of Death at BBC Online \nKiss of Death at IMDb\nPassage 2:\nSam &amp; Max Save the World\nSam & Max Save the World is a graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games. The game was originally released as Sam & Max: Season One before being renamed in early 2009. Save the World was developed in episodic fashion, comprising six episodes that were released for Microsoft Windows over the course of late 2006 and early 2007. The episodes were initially distributed online by GameTap and Telltale Games themselves, although the later retail releases of the game were published by The Adventure Company and JoWooD Productions in North America and Europe respectively. A Wii port of the game was published in late 2008, and an Xbox Live Arcade version was released in mid-2009. A remaster of the game by Skunkape Games was released in December 2020 for Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows, in August 2021 for Xbox One, and in September 2022 for PlayStation 4.Based on Steve Purcell's comic book series Sam & Max, the game follows the title characters Sam and Max—self-styled vigilante private investigators, the former an anthropomorphic dog and the latter a \"hyperkinetic rabbity thing\"—through several cases involving a hypnotism conspiracy. Each episode features one case with a contained story, with an underlying plot running through the series. The game was announced by Telltale Games in 2005 following the cancellation of Sam & Max: Freelance Police by LucasArts in the preceding year; many of the employees at Telltale Games were members of the Freelance Police development team.\nThe game received a positive response from critics, with praise bestowed on the game's humor, graphics and gameplay, but concerns were voiced over the low difficulty of the puzzles, repetition in design between episodes and the effectiveness of the story. Opinions dissented across the Atlantic; some British reviewers did not appreciate the writing in the way that American critics did. Nevertheless, the game has won several awards and is often cited by commentators as the first successful application of episodic distribution. The game was accompanied by a number of short machinima videos set between each episode. The game was followed by two episodic sequels: Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space in 2007 and Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse in 2010.\n\nGameplay\nSam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic adventure game in which the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments of the game and solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.The game implements an inventory system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks up during the course of the game. The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the World's predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.The characters can travel between a variety of locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player with a list of available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving sequences, usually involving pursuing or fleeing crimas Detective Constable Jack Silver (Episodes 3–6)\n\nSupporting cast\nMalcolm Tierney as Superintendent Charlie Vanne (Pilot)\nPhyllis Logan as Inspector Anne Warwick (Pilot)\nKenneth Cranham as Ricky Valesi (Pilot)\nSteven Berkoff as George Rolf (Episodes 1 and 2)\nAnita Dobson as Jean Harris (Episodes 1 and 2)\nZawe Ashton as Mia Davis (Episodes 1 and 2)\nRalph Brown as Ray Du Barriatte (Episodes 1, 2 and 6)\nDaniel Mays as Danny Bird (Episodes 1 and 2)\nNicky Henson as Vincent Fairey (Episodes 3 and 4)\nMichael McKell as Lee Wilde (Episodes 3 and 4)\nSteve Speirs as Benny Luck (Episode 6)\n\nEpisodes\nPilot (2001)\nSeries (2002)\nPassage 9:\nThe Frankenstein Chronicles\nThe Frankenstein Chronicles is a British television period crime drama series that first aired on ITV Encore on 11 November 2015, designed as a re-imagining of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nElephant\nElephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.\nElephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.  Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.\nMales (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and dead individuals of their kind.\nAfrican bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants have an iconic status in human culture and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"elephant\" is based on the Latin elephas (genitive elephantis) (\"elephant\"), which is the Latinised form of the Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos), probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script. As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal. The word \"elephant\" appears in Middle English as olyfaunt (c. 1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).\n\nTaxonomy\nElephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria.Three species of living elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). African elephants were traditionally considered a single species, Loxodonta africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species. Mammoths (Mammuthus) are nested within living elephants as they are more closely related to Asian elephants than to African elephants. Another extinct genus of elephant, Palaeoloxodon, is also recognised, which appears to have close affinities with and to have hybridised with African elephants.\n\nEvolution\nOver 180 extinct members of order Proboscidea have been described. The earliest proboscideans, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium are known from the late Paleocene. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and some, like Moeritherium and Barytherium were probably amphibious. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited more forested areas. Proboscidean diversification changed little during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, which may have been an ancestor to several later species.\nA major event in proboscidean evolution was the collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early Miocene, around 18-19 million years ago allowing proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland across Eurasia, and later, around 16-15 million years ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the \"shovel tuskers\" like Platybelodon), choerolophodontids and stegodontids. Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres.Elephantids are distinguished from earlier proboscideans by a major shift in the molar morphology to parallel lophs rather than the cusps of earlier proboscideans, allowing them to become higher crowned (hypsodont) and more efficient in consuming grass. The Late Miocene saw major climactic changes, which resulted in the decline and extinction of many proboscidean groups. The earliest members of modern genera of Elephantidae appeared during the latest Miocene-early Pliocene around 5 million years ago. The elephantid genera Elephasparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, imports of the species almost stopped by the end of the 1980s. Subsequently, the US received many captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they allow easy access to the animals and provide fund and knowledge for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Opponents claim that animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of wobbling the body or head and pacing the same route both forwards and backwards. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live just as long.The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was rebuked for using an electric prod on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices hurt the animals. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on positive reinforcement when training his animals. Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.\n\nAttacks\nElephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants have entered villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. From 2000 to 2004, 300 people died in Jharkhand, and in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.\nThroughout the country, 1,500 people were killed by elephants between 2019 and 2022, which led to 300 elephants being killed in kind. Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, though officials have disputed this. Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village in December 2002, killing six people, which led to the retaliatory slaughter of about 200 elephants by locals.\n\nCultural depictions\nElephants have a universal presence in global culture. They have been represented in art since Paleolithic times. Africa, in particular, contains many examples of elephant rock art, especially in the Sahara and southern Africa. In Asia, the animals are depicted as motifs in Hindu and Buddhist shrines and temples. Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience of them. The ancient Romans, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted elephants more accurately than medieval Europeans who portrayed them more like fantasy creatures, with horse, bovine and boar-like traits, and trumpet-like trunks. As Europeans gained more access to captive elephants during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by Leonardo da Vinci.Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African societies, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, in modern day Nigeria, placed elephant tusks underneath their death leader's feet in the grave. The animals' importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma in some traditions. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires, but could also take these things away. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human.\n\nIn Western popular culture, elephants symbolise the exotic, especially since – as with the giraffe, hippopotamus and rhinoceros – there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences. As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, where they are portrayed positively. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to or finding a family, such as \"The Elephant's Child\" from Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Disney's Dumbo, and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's The Saggy Baggy Elephant. Other elephant heroes given human qualities include Jean de Brunhoff's Babar, David McKee's Elmer, and Dr. Seuss's Horton.Several cultural references emphasise the elephant's size and strangeness. For instance, a \"white elephant\" is a byword for something that is weird, unwanted, and has no value. The expression \"elephant in the room\" refers to something that is being ignored but ultimately must be addressed. The story of the blind men and an elephant involves blind men touching different parts of an elephant and trying to figure out what it is.\n\nSee also\nAnimal track\nDesert elephant\nElephants' graveyard\nList of individual elephants\nMotty, captive hybrid of an Asian and African elephant\nNational Elephant Day (Thailand)\nWorld Elephant Day\nPassage 2:\nGajabrishta\nGaja in Sanskrit means elephant.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFifty Shades Freed (film)\nFifty Shades Freed is a 2018 American erotic romantic drama film directed by James Foley and written by Niall Leonard, and based on E. L. James's 2012 novel of the same name. It is the third and final installment in the Fifty Shades film series, following Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The film stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, and follows the couple as they marry, and must deal with Ana's former boss (Eric Johnson), who begins to stalk them.\nFollowing the first film premiered in February 2015, development on the sequels promptly began. By November 2015, Foley was hired to direct both sequels, which would be shot back-to-back in 2016.Principal photography on Fifty Shades Freed began simultaneously with Darker in February 2016, in Paris and Vancouver, and ended in July 2016.\nFifty Shades Freed was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, including a limited IMAX release. It was a box office success, grossing over $370 million worldwide against a production budget of $55 million, but the lowest-grossing film of the trilogy. Like its two predecessors, Fifty Shades Freed received negative reviews, with criticism for its screenplay and acting.\n\nPlot\nNewlyweds Christian and Anastasia are forced to cut their honeymoon short and return home after receiving news of a break-in at his corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen and security camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new personal security team.\nChristian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired an attractive architect, Gia Matteo, to rebuild it for her. She is annoyed when Gia openly flirts with him in her presence. Ana privately threatens to fire Gia if she keeps it up, forcing her to stop.\nWhen Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and meets her friend, Kate Kavanagh, for a drink. Kate is dating Christian's older brother Elliot and fears Elliot may be having an affair with Gia, his business associate. Jack Hyde attempts to kidnap Ana when she gets home. Ana's security team subdues him and he is arrested.\nAfter arguing with Christian about her night out with Kate, Ana berates him for being overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after, he surprises her with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and José. Elliot proposes to Kate, who accepts. It is revealed that Gia was only helping Elliot choose the ring.\nThe newlyweds continue with their erotic sexual experimentation, but it becomes complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is deeply disturbed, saying he had other plans for their early years together. He leaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. After he returns, Ana discovers that Christian had texted and met his ex-lover and former BDSM dominant, Elena Lincoln. She becomes angry with him and locks herself in the playroom for the night. He searches for Ana in the morning and they continue arguing, with Ana telling Christian how important the baby is to her.\nShortly after, Hyde is released on a $500,000 bond and phones demanding a ransom for Mia, Christian's abducted sister. Hyde demands $5 million in cash in two hours and threatens to kill her if his demands are not met. He warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the money alone. Ana takes a chequebook and revolver from Christian's desk and goes to the bank to withdraw the full amount.\nThe suspicious bank manager calls Christian. He thinks Ana is leaving him but then notices it coincides with Hyde's recent release, Mia's unknown whereabouts, and Ana's sudden large cash withdrawal. Hyde instructs Ana to get into a car parked in the alley and to hand over her phone to the driver to discard. She tricks Hyde by taking the bank manager's phone and slipping hers into the bag of money. She exits the back entrance to discover that the driver and Jack's accomplice is her co-worker, Liz.\nAna arrives at the drop-off site with the money. Hyde, psychotic and vengeful, attacks her, kicking her abdomen. Liz tries to stop him as Ana pulls out the revolver and shoots him in the leg. Christian and his security team, who electronically tracked Ana's cell phone, arrive and apprehend Hyde and Liz. Ana blacks out as she hears Christian's voice.\nAna awakens three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though angry at her recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Christian's adoptive mother, Grace, assures him that Ana will not leave him. She returns home the next day.\nChristian's private investigator, Welch, has left a report showing that Christian and Hyde had shared the same foster family, though he has no memory of this. Hyde was envious of Christian being adopted by the wealthy Grey family instead of him. Hyde also blackmailed Liz into being his accomplice. Christian and Ana also find out where his birth mother is buried. They visit her grave and he lays flowers on it.\nWhile Christian is playing his piano, Ana walks through the hallway to the living room to watch Christian. As she's watching him, flashbacks of Christian and Ana's time together are shown with \"Love Me like You Do\" playing. Ana then decides she wants to play. She sends him a text message to get his attention. As Christian joins Ana in the playroom, the music continues to play as Christian shuts the door, right after seeing Ana smile.\nSeven months later, Christian and Ana have a son named Teddy and Two years later Ana is pregnant with their second child.\n\nCast\nDakota Johnson as Anastasia \"Ana\" Grey, Christian's wife and Teddy's mother.\nJamie Dornan as Christian Grey, Ana's husband and Teddy's father\nEric Johnson as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss and stalker.\nEloise Mumford as Katherine Kavanagh, Ana's best friend and Elliot Grey's fiancée.\nRita Ora as Mia Grey, the adoptive daughter of Carrick Grey and Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey, and younger sister of Christian and Elliot Grey.\nLuke Grimes as Elliot Grey, older brother of Christian and Mia Grey, and Katherine's fiancé.\nVictor Rasuk as José Rodriguez, one of Anastasia's friends.\nMax Martini as Jason Taylor, Christian's bodyguard.\nJennifer Ehle as Carla May Wilks, Anastasia's mother.\nKim Basinger as Elena Lincoln, Christian's former dominant. (Unrated Version only)\nMarcia Gay His \"sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases\", and described it as \"depressing\". The book garnered some accolades. In December 2012, it won both \"Popular Fiction\" and \"Book of the Year\" categories in the UK National Book Awards. In that same month, Publishers Weekly named E. L. James the 'Publishing Person of the Year', causing an \"outcry from the literary world\". For example, \"What was Publishers Weekly thinking?\" asked Los Angeles Times writer Carolyn Kellogg, while a New York Daily News headline read, \"Civilization ends: E.L. James named Publishers Weekly's 'Person of the Year'.\"\n\nDepiction of BDSM\nThe Fifty Shades trilogy has also attracted criticism due to its depictions of BDSM, with Katie Roiphe of Newsweek asking \"But why, for women especially, would free will be a burden? ... It may be that power is not always that comfortable, even for those of us who grew up in it; it may be that equality is something we want only sometimes and in some places and in some arenas; it may be that power and all of its imperatives can be boring.\" Zap2it's Andrea Reiher expressed frustration at Roiphe's depiction of the series, stating that \"[b]eing submissive sexually is not tantamount to being the victim of abuse\" or that they're \"giving up their power or their equality with their partner\". Other sites such as Jezebel have responded to the article, with Jezebel listing reasons for Fifty Shades of Grey's popularity, stating that \"the vast majority of fans fawn over the emotional relationship Anastasia and Christian have, not about the sex.\"In an interview with Salon, several dominatrices have responded that while submission can be an escape from daily stresses, they also frequently have male clients and that trust is a big factor in dominant/submissive relationships. One interviewed former dominatrix and author, Melissa Febos, stated that even if the book's popularity was a result of women's \"current anxieties about equality\" that it \"doesn't mean that it's 'evidence of unhappiness, or an invalidation of feminism,' ...it might actually be a sign of progress that millions of women are so hungrily pursuing sexual fantasies independent of men.\" Writing in The Huffington Post, critic Soraya Chemaly argued that interest in the series was not a trend, but squarely within the tradition and success of the romance category which is driven by tales of virgins, damaged men and submission/dominance themes. Instead, she wrote, the books are notable not for transgressive sex but for how women are using technology to subvert gendered shame by exploring explicit sexual content privately using e-readers. Instead of submission fantasies representing a post-feminist discomfort with power and free will, women's open consumption, sharing and discussion of sexual content is a feminist success. At the beginning of the media hype, Dr. Drew and sexologist Logan Levkoff discussed the book on The Today Show, about whether Fifty Shades perpetuated violence against women; Levkoff said that while that is an important subject, this trilogy had nothing to do with it – this was a book about a consensual relationship. Dr. Drew commented that the book was \"horribly written\" in addition to being \"disturbing\" but stated that \"if the book enhances women's real-life sex lives and intimacy, so be it.\" Amy Bonomi, a Human Development and Family Studies professor argues that the relationship portrayed is non-consensual: \"Unable to bear the thought of being alone, Christian employs strategies to \"trap\" Anastasia, including keeping his violent tendencies private, limiting Anastasia's availability of help and support from her friends and family through his nondisclosure agreement and through verbal and nonverbal intimidation, and attempts to convince Anastasia that she finds his punishments pleasurable\"\n\nCensorship or removal of books\nIn March 2012, branches of the public library in Brevard County, Florida, removed copies of Fifty Shades of Grey from their shelves, with an official stating that it did not meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches. Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association commented that \"If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're being fair. In a public library there is usually very little that would prevent a book from being on the shelf if there is a demand for the information.\" Brevard County public libraries later made their copies available to their patrons due to public demand.In Macaé, Brazil, Judge Raphael Queiroz Campos ruled in January 2013 that bookstores throughout the city must either remove the series entirely from their shelves or ensure that the books are wrapped and placed out of the reach of minors. The judge stated that he was prompted to make such an order after seeing children reading them, basing his decision on a law stating that \"magazines and publications whose content is improper or inadequate for children and adolescents can only be sold if sealed and with warnings regarding their content\".\n\nFilm adaptations\nA film adaptation of the book was produced by Focus Features, Michael De Luca Productions, and Trigger Street Productions, with Universal Pictures and Focus Features securing the rights to the trilogy in March 2012. Universal is also the film's distributor. Charlie Hunnam was originally cast in the role of Christian Grey alongside Dakota Johnson in the role of Anastasia Steele, but Hunnam gave up the part in October 2013, with Jamie Dornan announced for the role on 23 October. The film was released on 13 February 2015, and became an immediate success, making it to #1 at the box office with $558.5 million. However, critical reactions were generally negative. After the first film premiered at a special fan screening in New York City on 6 February 2015, director Sam Taylor-Johnson confirmed two sequels to be succeeded after the first film, with Fifty Shades Darker releasing on 10 February 2017 and Fifty Shades Freed releasing on 9 February 2018.\n\nSee also\nBDSM in culture and media\nSadism and masochism in fiction\nSecretary (2002)\n\nFurther reading\nUpstone, Sara (2016). \"Beyond the bedroom: motherhood in E.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nVictor Diamond Mine\nThe Victor Mine was the first Canadian diamond mine located in Ontario, and De Beers' second diamond mine in Canada (after the Snap Lake Diamond Mine). It is located in the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire, in the James Bay Lowlands 90 kilometres (56 mi) west of Attawapiskat in the remote northern part of the province. In June 2005, the Attawapiskat First Nation voted in favour (85.5%) of ratifying the Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA). Construction of the mine began in February 2006 which created 3200 positions; mining and operations will create around 400 permanent positions. The Victor Mine is an open-pit mine, with a processing plant, workshops, and an airstrip located on site. By 2013–2014 royalties collected from De Beers Victor Mine amounted to $226. At that time De Beers was continuing to pay off its \"$1 billion investment to build the mine and from now until it closes, the company expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalties.\" The mine completed mining and processing in 2019 and has moved to a shut-down phase including demolition of infrastructure and rehabilitation of the site.\n\nHistory\nDe Beers started looking for Kimberlite Pipes within Canada in the 1960s. \"The Victor Mine was developed within a cluster of 16 kimberlite pipes that were discovered in the James Bay Lowlands near Attawapiskat in 1987.\"  In 1995 the pipes of the James Bay Lowland area were re-examined and interest was renewed in the Victor Mine Project. The cost feasibility of mining Victor diamonds was done in 2002. In 2005, the Project gained approval after an environmental assessment by the Federal and Provincial government and soon after construction began. In 2007, the Moose Cree First Nations peoples signed in favour of the Victor mine and the first successful productions of diamonds began. June 20, 2008, Victor Mine entered the production phase. De Beers celebrated its opening July 26 and reached an agreement with the Government of Ontario to allow up to 10% of the mine's production to be available to the cutting and polishing industry in Ontario. In October 2009, the Victor Mine was voted “Mine of the year” by readers of the international trade publication called Mining Magazine.\n\nGeology\nThe area is composed of 18 kimberlite pipes of the Attawapiskat kimberlite field, 16 of which are diamondiferous, the Victor Mine sits on top of the Victor pipe and mines from Victor Main and Victor Southwest which have appeared close enough to the surface to be used in an open-pit mine. The Victor Kimberlite is a composition of pyroclastic crater facies and hypabyssal facies, and is considered to have a highly variable diamond grade.\n\nMining\nIt is an open-pit mine; the equipment there is 100 tonne trucks, large front-end loaders, bulldozers and other necessary support equipment used in the mining operation. The annual production rate is 2.7 million tonnes a year, which comes to about 600,000 carats a year in diamond grade.\n\nOperations\nThere is year-round access via air travel and only seasonal access over land depending on whether the weather permits travel. On the property are warehouses for storage, a processing plant, workshops, offices, fuel storage facilities, pit-dewatering machinery and an airstrip (the Victor Mine Aerodrome) for travel needs. The site also has recreational and dorm buildings for the permanent staff. The life of the mine is expected to be twelve years and the total project life is seventeen years and each year the processing plan is designed to treat 2.5 million tonnes of kimberlite per year (roughly 7100 tonnes a day).\n\nTom Ormsby, director of external and corporate affairs for De Beers Canada claims that the great colour (whiteness), natural shapes, clearness and quality of the Victor diamonds ranks them with the highest stones in the world.\"Victor is forecasted to have a 17-year cradle-to-grave life. That includes construction, an estimated 12 years of operation and then winding down to closure and rehabilitation of the site.\"\n\nPerformance\nThe mine had produced at a high level of performance leading to \"[f]urther exploration of the site\" with the \"hope that De Beers will uncover another source of diamonds within close proximity of the existing operation.\" 826,000 carats were mined at Victor Mine in 2010 and \"$93 million was spent on goods and services and $49 million (53 per cent) was supplied by Aboriginal businesses.\"\"No corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes were paid in 2010 as the company was in a loss position for tax purposes.\" However, De Beers Canada \"injected approximately $474,900,000 into the Canadian economy in 2010\" through both mines, Snap Lake and Victor Mines.In 2011, De Beers paid total wages and benefits of about $55.5 million to Victor employees. According to the Ontario Mining Association, in 2011 \"$101 million was spent on goods and services\" by De Beers \"with about $57 million, or 57%, being provided by Aboriginal businesses.\"\n\nExploration\nTom Ormsby, claimed that \"The high quality of the Victor diamonds and the vastness of the Canadian shield points to great potential for another diamond mine being developed in northeastern Ontario.\" The \"Canadian Shield has great potential to host diamonds\" and potential in Canada \"appears to be at least twice as good as what southern Africa has held for potential for diamonds.\"\"There are approximately eight years remaining on the forecast life of mine for Victor.  In efforts to keep things going and extend this time frame, advanced exploration is currently underway at Victor on 15 previously identified diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.\"\n\nEnvironmental and human concerns\nSo far, De Beers Canada employees and its contract partners have safely worked more than four million hours without a Lost Time Injury. Other human concerns are the mine's impact on the First Nations people and the company's pledge to help promote community growth will affect certain communities more than others.Concerns were brought up regarding the mine's impact on the surrounding area. Since it is an open pit mine it would disturb the natural environment. The impact area is 5,000 hectares of land. The first concern was raised in 2005, when environmental groups called on the Ontario government to perform its own environmental impact assessment aside from the Federal one as it was believed the Federal assessment did not fully assess the situation, including long term harm on the wildlife, wilderness and the water systems found there. However, the Project did receive an ISO 14001 certification.The environmental assessment process was later criticized for its restricted scope, namely for focusing primarily on the Attawapiskat First Nation, and largely excluding other potentially affected First Nations.\n\nAttawapThis figure is based on 2012 gold prices, averaging close to USD $55,000 per kg.\nIn April 2007, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada engaged the Professional Services company Deloitte & Touche LLP to become their solicitor, in order to find another independently-owned and -operated company to acquire the idle mine as well as the resources on the land it occupied. To generate interest, they featured the mine as  holding 6.6 Teragrams of untapped resources, a gold processing mill and related equipment, a maintenance building, a dorm room styled housing complex, power and fuel storage facilities, and mobile equipment (rock trucks, excavators and loaders). It was also featured on the popular reality television show Ice Road Truckers.\n\nCleanup\nAfter being shut down in 1997 and abandoned shortly after by Royal Oak Mines, it transferred into the Canadian Government's hands and responsibility in mid-December 1999. In accordance with water licensing laws and regulations in Canada, Royal Oak Mines had posted a $1.5 million security deposit and in 1999 they were charged with cyanide dumping by the Federal Government. The government of Canada had estimated the cost of the cleanup at $70 million due to high levels of cyanide and ammonia content, as well as acid mine drainage.\nFor the people of Indian Lake the tailing pond owned by the mine was at one stage threatening to overflow unless immediate action was taken to prevent a disastrous environmental impact.  A public hearing was called to cancel the mines' license and to begin a cleanup.\nIn 1999, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) awarded a one-year, $2 million contract to a consortium of aboriginal businesses from DetonÇho Corporation, the Dogrib Rae Band and the North Slave Métis Alliance to undertake final reclamation activities at the Colomac Mine. The consortium conducted studies into contamination and took responsibility for on-going environmental monitoring and maintenance of the site. After the contract was awarded, Royal Oak Mine was finally charged under the Water Act and the Fisheries Act for the pollution it had  caused, this was much too late, since the company was already in receivership.\nAccording to MineWatch Canada in a 2001 publication:\n\"Now, the water license has not been changed, the money needed to clean-up the site is not forthcoming, and the Dogribs are faced with a potential catastrophe if the tailings pond overflows. Says Dogrib leader Ted Blondin: \"I think there is a fiduciary responsibility that the federal government has to looking after the Dogrib interests, and these are the arguments that we will use towards ensuring that the quality of water and the work that has to be done for the cleanup is done.\"During the initial cleanup phase, many new and effective remediation procedures where developed and put into place, including the use of farmed micro-organisms to remove hydrocarbons from soil contaminated by poor management of the fuel tank farm located on site.\nOn 25 February 2010 a $19 million contract was awarded to two aboriginal firms, Tlicho Engineering/Environmental Services Ltd and Aboriginal Engineering Ltd for a final two year remediation contract, which will also create local jobs in the area. According to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada this two year remediation will cover:\n\"final remediation of the site, including: major demolition activities (primary and secondary crushing facilities, mill complex, maintenance shop and camp); hydrocarbon remediation (restoration of Steeve's Lake shoreline, free product recovery and soil treatment); site restoration (Truck Lake channel construction, stream crossing restoration) and capping of the non-hazardous landfill sites as well as continued provision of site services and maintenance. The contract, which follows a competitive process, will last until April of 2012 when the companies will conduct a full and final demobilization of the site.\"\nIn May 2010, officials suspended the remediation project due to an accident, which occurred at mine in April 2010. It occurred after a foremen working for Aboriginal Engineering Ltd suffered leg injuries after a 2.5 cm cable snapped. Human Resources and Skills Canada announced in May 2010 that they would not allow this remediation to continue until Aboriginal Engineering Ltd set out to implement the standards for health and safety set out by the Federal Government in relation to this type of task.\nPassage 9:\nMurowa diamond mine\nThe Murowa diamond mine is a diamond mine located in Mazvihwa, south central Zimbabwe, about 40 kilometres from the asbestos mining town of Zvishavane in the Midlands province. The mine is majority owned and operated by the Rio Tinto Group, which also owns the Argyle diamond mine in Australia and part of the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada. The mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD and mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne.\n\nGeology of the Deposit\nMurowa consists of three north-trending kimberlite pipes, intrusive into the Chivi suite granites of the Zimbabwe Craton. The kimberlites have been dated at 500 Ma.\n\nHistory\nThe Murowa site's possibilities were first realized in 1997 when three diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes were discovered; over a period of three years of study, the two larger pipes have been determined to be economically feasible as mines. Construction of mine facilities was completed in late 2004. Preparation for mining included the forced relocation of 926 people living on the mine site to six farms purchased by a government relocation program. Limited mining operations began in Murowa in 2004, with full capacity expected to be reached sometime in 2005, although permitting problems have slowed progress toward this milestone. Full-scale production is expected to process 200,000 tonnes of ore annually, although it is possible to push production to as much as one million tonnes annually through further capital investment.\nThe mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD. Current estimates of mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne. Rio Tinto estimates that over the life of the mine, prices for the Murowa's production will fetch an average price of $65 USD per carat (325 $/g).\nPassage 10:\nNegus Mine\nNegus Mine was a gold producer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, from 1939 to 1952.

It was created by Douglas TenNapel, creator of Earthworm Jim, and Doug Langdale, the developer of Earthworm Jim the animated series, and was a production of Columbia TriStar Television under Adelaide Productions, with original music by Shawn Patterson (main title theme by Terry Scott Taylor). TenNapel and Taylor also collaborated on the video games The Neverhood, Boombots and Skullmonkeys, and in 2005, re-united for the Nickelodeon cartoon Catscratch.\nThe show was cancelled after only one season, as CBS cancelled all of their Saturday morning schedule in 1997 to stop their downward-spiraling ratings.The Federal Communications Commission also rejected CBS's attempt to classify the show as educational and informational under that fall's strengthened requirements for children's programming.\n\nSynopsis\nThe show parodied the style of action-adventure cartoons. Set in the future, it was based around a genetic shapeshifter experiment known as Project GKR (Geno-Kinetic Research), who had been stolen by Lady MacBeth (a short-tempered cyborg with a bionic arm) before the creator could finish programming. He needed to be a deadly and powerful weapon at the hands of the evil Mister Moloch, head of Moloch Industries, but due to the lack of his final programming, \"GeeKeR\" is left to be a totally random, permanently salivating, four-fingered klutz. He only occasionally manages to use his powers to any full extent, a blessing and a threat to his friends and their enemies. Lady MacBeth (whom GeeKeR calls Becky) and her partner-in-crime Noah, a baseball cap-wearing intelligent Tyrannosaurus rex, must now prevent Moloch and GeeKeR's creator Dr. Maston from ever obtaining GeeKeR at all costs.\n\nCast\nBilly West as G.e.e.K.e.R., Additional Voices\nCree Summer as Lady MacBeth, Nanny, Sonny, Additional Voices\nCharles Adler as Dr. Maston, Jake Dragonn, Gene Damage, Additional Voices\nJim Cummings as Mister Moloch, Will Dragonn, Cosmotto, Additional Voices\nBrad Garrett as Noah, Captain Wormhole\n\nAdditional voices\nDanny Mann as Redjack\nEd Gilbert as Dinosaur Leader\nJeff Bennett as Larry the Virus\nCharity James\nKath Soucie\nDee Dee Rescher as Female Junker\nJoe Alaskey\nJason Marsden as Kid Dinosaur\nKevin Michael Richardson as Stonebender/\"Mr. Smiley\", Additional Voices\nJoe Lala\nMichael Bell as Toxic Moose\nLisa Kaplan\n\nEpisodes\nCredits\nExecutive Producers: Douglas TenNapel and Douglas Langdale\nSupervising Producer: Richard Raynis\nProducer: Audu Paden\nAssociate Producers: Monique Beatty and Greg Chalekian\nProduction Coordinator: Luke Wasserman\nOriginal Music: Shawn Patterson\nTheme Song: Terry Scott Taylor\nColor Designer: Don W.

Two days before the show was set to air, Columbia TriStar discovered a licensing issue with Terry and Patterson was asked by the producers to compose and produce a main title theme to go on the air. Shawn completed this and Project GeeKeR aired with Shawn's original main title music. Weeks into the series, the licensing problem with Terry Scott Taylor was cleared up and the show's creator Doug TenNapel requested that Terry's original main title theme be reinserted into the series. Patterson's main title music was then removed from the remainder of the series.\n\nSee also\nEarthworm Jim\nThe Weekenders\nDave the Barbarian\nCatscratch\nDoug TenNapel\nDoug Langdale\nSony Pictures Entertainment\nPassage 2:\nDavid W.

It has since spawned a spin-off television series (Go, Diego, Go!), a sequel television series (Dora and Friends: Into the City!) and a live-action feature film.Before rebranding to Paramount Global, the corporation previously named ViacomCBS announced a revival of the Dora the Explorer brand 3 years after its last production, which includes a preschool-aimed CGI animated TV series, and a tween-aimed live-action series, both of which are scheduled for distribution on Paramount+.\n\nOrigins\nThe franchise has its roots from the television show of the same name which centers around Dora Márquez, a seven-year-old Latina girl, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots). Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, the Spanish language, or counting. Common rituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a bipedal, anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must bearthworm Jim (1995)\nThe Savage Dragon (1995–1996)\nThe Mouse and the Monster (1996)\nAll Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series (1998)\nTimon & Pumbaa (1999)\nSherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century (1999)\nJackie Chan Adventures (2001)\nTeamo Supremo (2002)\nHouse of Mouse (2002)\nLilo & Stitch: The Series (2003)\nJustice League Unlimited (2004)\nSuper Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!

The series is about the title character, who uses a wheelchair, emphasizing that he lived a normal life. It was based on the books created by John Callahan. Making a show suitable for children required toning down Callahan's dark humor somewhat, and the show was positive and life-affirming. For this, the show was very groundbreaking at the time.\n\nCharacters\nPelswick Eggert (voiced by Robert Tinkler) – A 13-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair. How he became a paraplegic is not revealed in the series, but the series' creators imply through commentary that it was due to a car accident. He dislikes it when people treat him differently because of his disability. He dislikes following the crowd and he goes by his own rules.\nAce Nakamura (voiced by Phil Guerrero) – Pelswick's best friend. Ace is technologically smarter than any of his friends, and is often the thinker of the situation.\nGoon Gunderson (voiced by Peter Oldring) – Pelswick's other best friend. Huge and slow-witted in his actions and thoughts, Goon is generally good-hearted but rather dangerous when angry. He does not know that wrestling is staged.\nJulie Smockford (voiced by Julie Lemieux) – A pretty girl and Pelswick's love interest. She hates all the cliques and popularity contests at school and seems to care mostly about her popularity and image. Julie is smart, dramatic, sometimes annoying, but cares a lot about Pelswick. Pelswick has a crush on her but she is completely oblivious about it. Julie believes in justice for all.\nSandra Scoddle (voiced by Kim Kuhteubl) – Julie's snooty and arrogant best friend/rival and one of Pelswick's friends. She thinks she is better than everyone else and often disputes with Julie. She thinks she is cool, but she's not. She gets caught into the latest trends.\nMr. Jimmy (voiced by David Arquette) – Pelswick's guardian angel who often gives him advice that confuses him until the last moment, no matter what it is. Pelswick cannot stand him and his issues. He is also the comic relief of the show.\nKate Eggert (voiced by Tracey Moore) – Pelswick's precocious younger sister. She treats her reputation as a little sister like a business and usually blackmails Pelswick when butting into his business. She has dreams of owning a big corporation. She is 10 years old.\nBobby Eggert – Pelswick's and Kate's baby brother. He rarely talks and admires Pelswick. Given that Pelswick and Kate's mother is unseen, it can be assumed Bobby is either adopted or is the child of a relative that their father is taking care of.\nQuentin Eggert (voiced by Tony Rosato) – Pelswick, Kate and Bobby's politically correct father who works as a college professor until he is fired in \"The Case of the Filched Files.\" He later gets his job back. He wants to do everything by papers. His wife was killed in the same car accident that made Pelswick into a paraplegic.\nPriscilla \"Gram-Gram\" Eggert (voiced by Ellen Ray Hennessy) – Quentin's mother and Pelswick, Kate and Bobby's deranged grandmother. She often does \"extreme\" acts beyond that of a grandmother. Most of these acts results in her getting arrested.\nBoyd Scullarzo (voiced by Chuck Campbell) – The bully of Pelswick's school who likes bullying Pelswick and others, not physically but with humiliation.\nVice Principal Ziegler (voiced by David Huband) – The vice principal of Jr High (Pelswick's school). Despite his title, he usually assumes the role of a principal. Throughout the show, there is no mention of there being a principal at Jr High. During the second episode of the series, this issue was lampshaded by Goon Gunderson who questioned why their school had a vice principal but no principal.\n\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2000–01)\nSeason 2 (2001–02)\nBroadcast\nThe show aired in reruns on CBS during the Nick on CBS block from September 14 to November 23, 2002, and on Nicktoons from May 2002 to September 2005. The show reran on Adult Swim in Canada between early 2021 and mid-2022.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible.\" Grey recalled in a 2020 interview that an airline employee who checked her identity refused to believe that she and the actress the employee knew from Dirty Dancing were one and the same.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAugust Hirt\nAugust Hirt (28 April 1898 – 2 June 1945) was an anatomist with Swiss and German nationality who served as a chairman at the Reich University in Strasbourg during World War II. He performed experiments with mustard gas on inmates at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp and played a lead role in the murders of 86 people at Natzweiler-Struthof for the Jewish skull collection. The skeletons of his victims were meant to become specimens at the Institute of anatomy in Strasbourg, but completion of the project was stopped by the progress of the war. He was an SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) and in 1944, an SS-Sturmbannführer (major).\n\nWorld War I, post-war education and joining the Nazi party\nHirt was the son of a Swiss business man. In 1914, he volunteered, while still a high school student, to fight in World War I on the German side. In October 1916, he was wounded in the upper jaw by a bullet. He received the Iron Cross and returned to Mannheim in 1917. He studied medicine at Heidelberg University. In 1921, he gained German citizenship. In 1922, Hirt obtained his doctorate in medicine with \"Der Grenzstrang des Sympathicus bei einigen Sauriern\" (English: The Ganglions in the Sympathetic Nervous System of Some Lizards). He then worked at the Anatomical Institute in Heidelberg and in 1925 he was authorized to teach thanks to a thesis on nerve cells. In 1930 he became professor at Heidelberg University.\nIn September 1932, Hirt joined the Militant League for German Culture. On 1 April 1933, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS-Nr. 100 414), and was promoted to Hauptsturmführer (captain) on 1 July 1937, but he was only a member of the Nazi Party from 1 May 1937, when he enrolled in the universities of the Reich (Mitgliedsnr. 4012784). From 1 March 1942, he was a member of the personal staff of the RuSHA, the organisation in charge of \"racial and ideological purity\" of the members of the SS. He attained the rank of Sturmbannführer (major) in 1944.\nHirt was married and had a son and a daughter.\n\nWorld War II\nFrom 1 April 1936 Hirt was associate director of the Institute of  anatomy at University of Greifswald. On 1 October 1938, he obtained the same post at Goethe University. At the beginning of the Second World War he was an SS medical chief (from August 1939 to April 1941). During this time the Battle of France took place, resulting in the fall of France and its occupation by German forces, and Hirt participated in the battle. He then became director of the new Institute of anatomy at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg.\n\nJewish skeleton collection\nThe Ahnenerbe under the Third Reich was a society that organised \"medical experiments\" on prisoners. Hirt conceived and directed one called the Jewish skeleton collection, which was begun but not completed as intended. He also performed experiments on cadavers and collected human skulls. He was appointed director since 1941 of the Institute of Anatomy in Strasbourg. He wanted to create a collection of skulls of \"Judeo-Bolsheviks\", as part of his research on race. According to him, the Jewish race was on the point of extinction and he wished to gather a collection of them while there was still time. Hirt sent his project to Heinrich Himmler. Hirt wrote of this project: \"There are important collections of skulls of nearly all the races and peoples. Except for the Jews, of which science has so few skulls, so it is not possible to draw any meaningful inferences. The war in the East gives us the opportunity to fill the gap. We have the opportunity to acquire a tangible scientific document by procuring the skulls of Jewish-Bolsheviks who embody the disgusting but characteristic subhuman.\": 882 Hirt conceived the project to go beyond a collection of skulls, to a collection of Jewish skeletons and so presented his research plan to Himmler. He approved the project so that Hirt could begin his \"medical experiments.\" Working with the Ahnenerbe division, Wolfram Sievers, Bruno Beger, Hans Fleischhacker and Hirt together collected people from among the Auschwitz inmates in order to create an anatomical specimen collection specifically of Jews. Hirt proposed to use the small-scale gas chamber at Natzweiler-Struthof to murder the people selected, keeping their corpses intact, and then have their corpses shipped immediately to the Anatomical Institute in Strasbourg for the casts and skeletons he wanted for this collection.: 882 Hirt directed that 115 persons be selected for measurements: 79 Jewish men, 30 Jewish women, 2 Poles, and 4 \"Asians\".: 882  They were selected among the inmates in August 1943 at Auschwitz by his assistants, the anthropologists Bruno Beger and Hans Fleischhacker. The group was quarantined to protect them from a typhus epidemic in the camp. Measurements were taken of the selected inmates at Auschwitz. Of those initially selected, it is believed that 89 persons (60 men and 29 women) were sent to Natzweiler-Struthof. Three men died en route, leaving 86 people.\n\nNatzweiler-Struthof camp\nThese 86 people were sent to Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp on 30 July 1943. They were fed reasonably well to improve their appearance for the body casts. They were divided into four groups and successively gassed by Josef Kramer, on 11, 13, 17, and 19 August 1943. Their bodies were returned to Hirt at the anatomical laboratory of the Reich University in Strasbourg for preparation as an anthropological display, taking body casts and preparing the skeletons.In September 1944, the rapid approach of the Allies led to the project being abandoned and Himmler ordered the destruction of all traces of this compromising collection.: 883  That order was not completed, nor had the casts been taken or the skeletons been prepared. The Allies found corpses and partial remains preserved in formalin for eighty-six bodies upon the liberation of Strasbourg.: 884  The corpses were buried 23 October 1945 in the municipal cemetery of Strasbourg-Robertsau before being transferred in 1951 to the Jewish cemetery of Strasbourg-Cronenbourg. The names of the victims were not known, and the purpose for their presence at the Anatomical Institute were not known. Some information was learned in post-war trials as to the project proposed by Hirt.\nAugust Hirt fled Strasbourg in September/ Cat Stevens\" and is his first record under the Cat Stevens name since Back to Earth in 1978. The album earned him his first nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In July 2018, Yusuf signed with BMG Rights Management, which will publish his songwriting credits worldwide and distribute nine of his studio albums. On 29 March 2019, Yusuf performed in Christchurch, New Zealand, at the National Remembrance Service for victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings.On 3 March 2020, Yusuf played the Music for the Marsden benefit concert at the O2 Arena in London. On 28 May 2020, Yusuf announced his next album, Tea for the Tillerman 2, and it was released on 18 September 2020, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original LP. Known as TT2, Tea for the Tillerman 2 is a re-imagining and re-recording of the songs from the earlier album, with updated interpretations and arrangements. On 25 September 2020, Yusuf was the guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs. Yusuf is one of a small number of guests that have chosen their own music as a desert island choice, however he picked the Stevie Wonder Motown hit 'As' for his favoured choice in front of his own recording, if only one could be saved.\nTeaming up with Playing for Change, in 2021 Yusuf / Cat Stevens recorded a new version of \"Peace Train\" with over 25 musicians from 12 countries.\n\n2023: Yusuf / Cat Stevens - European Tour and King of a Land\nIn June 2023, Yusuf / Cat Stevens performed shows in Berlin, Hamburg, Rome, Marbella and made his first ever appearance at Glastonbury Festival.On 16 June 2023, Yusuf/Cat Stevens released King of a Land, a new studio album with children's music and religious music influences,.\nOn the 25th June 2023, Yusuf played the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, including covering iconic Beatles hits and his Teacup album memories.\n\nAwards\nHumanitarian awards\n2003: World Award (also known as the \"World Social Award\"), an award organised by Mikhail Gorbachev, for \"humanitarian relief work helping children and victims of war\".\n2004: Man of Peace Award of the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates (an award organisation founded by Mikhail Gorbachev) for his \"dedication to promote peace, the reconciliation of people and to condemn terrorism\".\n2009: Honorary Award of the German Sustainability Award\n2015: Global Islamic Economy Awards for contributions toward peace through the Arts\n2015: Steiger Award honoured in the category \"International\" for his commitment to charitable projects\n\nHonorary degrees\n2005: Honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire for services to education and humanitarian relief.\n2007: Honorary doctorate (LLD) by the University of Exeter, in recognition of \"his humanitarian work and improving understanding between Islamic and Western cultures\".\n\nMusic awards and recognitions\n2019: Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame\n2017: Grammy Award nomination for Best Folk Album\n2015: Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards\n2014: Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n2008: Nomination (unsuccessful) for Songwriters Hall of Fame\n2007: The Mediterranean Art and Creativity Award by the Fondazione Mediterraneo.\n2007: Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA).\n2007: ECHO \"Special Award for Life Achievements as a Musician and Ambassador Between Cultures\"\n2006: ASCAP Songwriter of the Year for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" (second time)\n2006: Ranked 49th in Paste's \"100 Best Living Songwriters\"\n2005: ASCAP Songwriter of the Year and Song of the Year for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\"\n\nDiscography\nAs Cat Stevens1967: Matthew and Son\n1967: New Masters\n1970: Mona Bone Jakon\n1970: Tea for the Tillerman\n1971: Teaser and the Firecat\n1972: Catch Bull at Four\n1973: Foreigner\n1974: Buddha and the Chocolate Box\n1975: Numbers\n1977: Izitso\n1978: Back to EarthAs Yusuf Islam1995: The Life of the Last Prophet\n1999: Prayers of the Last Prophet\n2000: A Is for Allah\n2001: Bismillah\n2002: In Praise of the Last Prophet\n2003: I Look I See\n2008: I Look, I See 2\n2014: The Story of Adam and CreationAs Yusuf2006: An Other Cup\n2009: Roadsinger\n2014: Tell 'Em I'm GoneAs Yusuf / Cat Stevens2017: The Laughing Apple\n2020: Tea for the Tillerman 2\n2023: King of a Land\n\nBooks\nThe Life of The Last Prophet, 1996.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFrançois Englert\nFrançois, Baron Englert (French: [ɑ̃ɡlɛʁ]; born 6 November 1932) is a Belgian theoretical physicist and 2013 Nobel Prize laureate.\nEnglert is professor emeritus at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where he is a member of the Service de Physique Théorique. He is also a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University and a member of the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California. He was awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics (with Gerry Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, and Robert Brout), the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2004 (with Brout and Higgs) and the High Energy and Particle Prize of the European Physical Society (with Brout and Higgs) in 1997 for the mechanism which unifies short and long range interactions by generating massive gauge vector bosons.\nEnglert has made contributions in statistical physics, quantum field theory, cosmology, string theory and supergravity. He is the recipient of the 2013 Prince of Asturias Award in technical and scientific research, together with Peter Higgs and the CERN.\nEnglert was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics, together with Peter Higgs for the discovery of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.\n\nEarly life\nFrançois Englert is a Holocaust survivor. He was born in a Belgian Jewish family. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, he had to conceal his Jewish identity and live in orphanages and children's homes in the towns of Dinant, Lustin, Stoumont and, finally, Annevoie-Rouillon.  These towns were eventually liberated by the US Army.\n\nAcademic career\nHe graduated as an electromechanical engineer in 1955 from the Free University of Brussels (ULB) where he received his PhD in physical sciences in 1959. From 1959 until 1961, he worked at Cornell University, first as a research associate of Robert Brout and then as assistant professor. He then returned to the ULB, where he became a university professor and was joined there by Robert Brout who, in 1980, with Englert coheaded the theoretical physics group. In 1998 Englert became professor emeritus. In 1984 Englert was first appointed as a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel-Aviv University. Englert joined Chapman University's Institute for Quantum Studies in 2011, where he serves as a distinguished visiting professor.\n\nThe Brout–Englert–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism\nBrout and Englert showed in 1964 that gauge vector fields, abelian and non-abelian, could acquire mass if empty space were endowed with a particular type of structure that one encounters in material systems. Focusing on the failure of the Goldstone theorem for gauge fields, Higgs reached essentially the same result. A third paper on the subject was written later in the same year by Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble. The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Englert and Brout, and Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble were each recognized as milestone papers for this discovery by Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration. While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers is noteworthy.\nTo illustrate the structure, consider a ferromagnet which is composed of atoms each equipped with a tiny magnet. When these magnets are lined up, the inside of the ferromagnet bears a strong analogy to the way empty space can be structured. Gauge vector fields that are sensitive to this structure of empty space can only propagate over a finite distance. Thus, they mediate short range interactions and acquire mass. Those fields that are not sensitive to the structure propagate unhindered. They remain massless and are responsible for the long range interactions. In this way, the mechanism accommodates within a single unified theory both short and long-range interactions.\nBrout and Englert, Higgs, and Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble introduced as agent of the vacuum structure a scalar field (most often called the Higgs field) which many physicists view as the agent responsible for the masses of fundamental particles. Brout and Englert also showed that the mechanism may remain valid if the scalar field is replaced by a more structured agent such as a fermion condensate. Their approach led them to conjecture that the theory is renormalizable. The eventual proof of renormalizability, a major achievement of twentieth century physics, is due to Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman who were awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for this work. The Brout–Englert–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism is the building stone of the electroweak theory of elementary particles and laid the foundation of a unified view of the basic laws of nature.\n\nMajor awards\n1978 First Prize in the International Gravity Contest (with R. Brout and E. Gunzig), awarded by the Gravity Research Foundation for the essay \"The Causal Universe\".\n1982 Francqui Prize, awarded by the Francqui Foundation once every four years in exact sciences \"For his contribution to the theoretical understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the physics of fundamental interactions, where, with Robert Brout, he was the first to show that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories gives mass to the gauge particles, for his extensive contributions in other domains, such as solid state physics, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, general relativity and cosmology, for the originality and the fundamental importance of these achievements\".\n1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize (with R. Brout and P.W. Higgs), awarded by the European Physical Society \"For formulating for the first time a self-consistent theory of charged massive vector bosons which became the foundation of the electroweak theory of elementary particles\".\n2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (with R.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAdrenaline (album)\nAdrenaline is the debut studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on October 3, 1995, by Maverick Records. The majority of the album was produced by Terry Date, while a hidden track titled \"Fist\" was produced by Ross Robinson.\n\nBackground and recording\nStephen Carpenter, Abe Cunningham and Chino Moreno were high school friends. All three went to Sacramento's C. K. McClatchy High School together, and participated in the city's skateboarding scene. Carpenter was a fan of heavy metal; Moreno was interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains as well as post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode and the Cure. When Moreno learned that Carpenter was a guitarist, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums. The trio began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched instruments and became the band's drummer. Chi Cheng filled the void as bassist, and the band recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards.Regarding the recording, drummer Abe Cunningham said, \"At the time we did the first record – which I really like and think is good – you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better\". Frontman Chino Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded \"really fast\", and he performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone.\n\nComposition\nMusically, Adrenaline has been described as alternative metal, post-hardcore, nu metal, and rap rock.\n\nPromotion\n\"7 Words\" was released as the first promotional single from the album on December 17, 1995. It was followed by \"Bored\", issued as the second promotional single on April 4, 1996. Music videos were released for \"7 Words\" and \"Bored\". The song \"Engine No. 9\" was also featured in the film Law Abiding Citizen.Deftones performed heavily throughout North America to support the album, going on tours with Handsome, Korn, White Zombie and Super 8 (whose vocalist helped discover Deftones). They also opened for Kiss on their Alive/Worldwide Tour.\n\nReception\nAdrenaline was praised for its new, innovative sound, with critics initially comparing it to a diverse range of acts such as Helmet, Nine Inch Nails, the Cure, Korn, Nirvana, and the Smashing Pumpkins. In his 1995 review, Kerrang!'s Paul Brannigan felt the album's sound \"falls between Quicksand and Tool\", and said Deftones \"explode from atmospheric croons into buck-mad rages\". He wrote, \"Excellent production from Terry Date allows the crisp guitar on 'Lifter' and '7 Words' to shine\", and that \"Bored\" and \"Nosebleed\" are \"just as blunt and angry, slabs of guitar crashing down on swirling, hypnotic rhythms.\" Brannigan rated it 4 out of 5 stars, saying it was \"Impressive.\" In 1995, Jon Wiederhorn of Pulse stated that \"Adrenaline pitches between gloom-saturated melodies and explosive riffs, lashing out like a sleep-deprived paranoiac awakened by noisy neighbors. The rhythms are crisp and crafty and the vocals resonate both fury and sensitivity in a way that's similar to, but far more blatantly metallic than Nirvana\". Critic Katherine Turman wrote in January 1996, \"If this is what heavy metal is evolving into, it's a damn good thing\".Giving the album 3 out of 4 stars in her 1996 review, Los Angeles Times critic Sandy Masuo praised the album's nuance and blend of musical extremes and various influences: \"On the outside, Sacramento's Deftones are all pummeling rhythms and high anxiety, but delving further into the music turns up some surprising nuances: traces of post-punk pop, tinges of rap, a pinch of industrial grit. Chino Moreno rants, sobs, croons and even works some Middle Eastern overtones into his vocals, while Stephen Carpenter's guitar shifts from coarse outbursts to crisp Helmet-ine precision. A bracing blend of extremes\". In his 1996 review, Tomas Pascual of Livewire magazine similarly noted the album's subtle yet diverse musical influences and the juxtaposition of loud and heavy with soft and melodic: \"There are many bands these days that lay claim to a diverse section of influences. But no one band is as subtly boisterous about their eclectic mix as are Deftones. [...] Deftones' course is piloted by vocalist and frontman Chino Moreno, who expresses his smooth, melodic lyrics emotionally one minute before giving way to abrasive, maddened screams the next. Backed by the serene and apocalyptic guitar of Stephen Carpenter, this Yin-Yang formula keeps Deftones' debut Adrenaline progressively contagious\".\n\nRetrospective reviews\nIn a retrospective AllMusic review of the album, Daniel Gioffre wrote, \"Unlike many of their contemporaries, Deftones are very controlled even in the midst of chaos\", adding, \"Throw Abe Cunningham's surprisingly sophisticated drumming into the mix, and you have a band that possesses a far greater degree of nuance than most others that work in the genre\". While he noted that \"there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit\", Gioffre ultimately states that \"[o]n later albums, the band's progressive tendencies become more developed, but the more straight-ahead material on Adrenaline does not disappoint. A promising debut.\" In the book The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal, author Essi Berelian wrote that the album \"still stands as one of the best examples of nu-metal\". Writing for MetalSucks in June 2009, Carlos Ramirez noted that the wide range of musical influences in both Adrenaline and Around the Fur helped to establish the band in the underground music scene prior to their larger commercial breakthrough with third album White Pony: \"[Deftones'] first two albums, Adrenaline (1995) and Around the Fur (1997), were both chock full of bombastic guitars, new wave-kissed vocal lines, and post-hardcore informed arrangements, and their wide-scoped sound helped the Sacramento, CA band find audiences in various facets of the underground music scene\".

It was the band's third album and was named \"best punk album\" at the 2003 San Diego Music Awards. With it the band distanced themselves from their previous punk rock sound by incorporating much more of an influence of classic rock and heavy metal bands such as AC/DC, Motörhead and Def Leppard. They also distanced themselves from the secret agent mythos they had created for themselves by ceasing to wear matching black suits in concert and by ceasing to write songs dealing with the existence of extraterrestrials and UFOs. The song \"Loaded\" was originally titled \"Fuckin' Loaded\" but was changed for printing on the album sleeve. They received airplay on local rock radio station 91X for the song \"She's My Heroine.\" The album was the band's last before their extended hiatus, and they would not reconvene until a reunion show in 2005.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCropper, Kentucky\nCropper is an unincorporated community within Shelby County, Kentucky, United States. It was also known as Croppers Depot. Their post office  is closed. The town of Cropper (Population Cal. at 205 in 2010) is located in northeast Shelby County, Kentucky. The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets.\nPassage 2:\nStelljes House\nThe Stelljes House is a historic house on New Hampshire Route 31 in Goshen, New Hampshire. Built about 1800, it is one of the oldest of a cluster of plank-frame houses in Goshen. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It has possibly been demolished.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Stelljes House stands in a rural area of southern Goshen, on the east side of NH 31. It is a 1+1⁄2-story wooden structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A brick chimney rises slightly off-center from the roof ridge. The main facade is asymmetrical, with a slightly off-center entrance, two sash windows to its left, and a three-section modern picture window to the right. A gable dormer projects from the rear roof face. An ell extends from the southern portion of the rear of the main block, with a porch in the corner joining the two blocks.The house was built about 1800, and is one of the oldest of Goshen's cluster of plank-frame houses. The framing is three-inch planking attached vertically to sills, which rests on a rubble and granite stone foundation. Dowels are attached horizontally to give this framing lateral stability. The front facade was probably originally five bays across.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sullivan County, New Hampshire\nPassage 3:\nHaverstraw, New York\nHaverstraw  is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States, located north of the Town of Clarkstown and the Town of Ramapo; east of Orange County; south of the Town of Stony Point; and west of the Hudson River. The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section. The population was 39,087 at the 2020 census.The name comes from the Dutch word Haverstroo meaning \"oats straw\", referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area's historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County.\n\nHistory\nIn 1609, the region was explored by Henry Hudson. A land purchase was made in this town in 1666 from local natives and confirmed as a patent in 1671.  The region was known as Haverstroo, meaning \"oat straw\" in Dutch.\nDuring the American Revolution, it served as an important lookout for British activities on the Hudson. A blue-marked trail, the Long Path, may be taken 2 miles (3 km) eastward from Central Highway along the crest of South Mountain to High Tor. Halfway is Little Tor, the second highest peak on South Mountain.\nThe town of Haverstraw was formed in 1788 while still part of Orange County, New York.  Haverstraw was partitioned in 1791 to form the town of Clarkstown and the town of Ramapo and again in 1865 to form the town of Stony Point.\nIn 1826 the town was the site of a short-lived effort to establish an Owenite colony called the Franklin Community. Underfinanced and wracked by internal dissent, the model Owenite community folded after a mere five months of operation.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.4 square miles (71.0 km2), of which 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2) is land and 5.3 square miles (13.6 km2), or 19.19%, is water.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 33,811 people, 11,255 households, and 8,328 families residing in the town.  The population density was 1,508.3 inhabitants per square mile (582.4/km2).  There were 11,553 housing units at an average density of 515.4 per square mile (199.0/km2).  The racial makeup of the town was 66.24% white, 10.27% black or African American, .41% Native American, 3.21% Asian, .10% Pacific Islander, 15.65% from other races, and 4.12% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.73% of the population.\nHaverstraw has one of largest Dominican communities in the United States with Dominicans making up 32.4% of the populationThere were 11,255 households, out of which 37.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.4% were married couples living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.0% were non-families. 21.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.94 and the average family size was 3.4at the townsite in 1892. Carpenter began to formulate big plans for his village. He envisioned it as a tourist resort complete with hotel, dance pavilion, picnic areas, and even a lake that was to be fed by a spring located near his Book Cliff mines. Carpenter renamed the camp Poland Spring after a noted resort of that name in Maine. It was variously referred to as Polen, Pollen, and Polan Springs, although Carpenter's intended name was evidenced by his having it emblazoned on the side of one of his railroad excursion cars. The resort plans were never completed because Carpenter went broke shortly after the Panic of 1893.\nIsaac Chauncey Wyman, a wealthy Massachusetts investor, became the next owner of the Book Cliff company. The town continued to enjoy an active existence because he did much to improve the mines and thus created a need for additional employees. The old eating house, referred to as the Hotel de Carpenter on occasion, was converted into a school and church for the camp's inhabitants, and many company structures were rebuilt and improved during Wyman's tenure as owner. The new name Book Cliff was applied to the town but did not adhere any better than did Poland Springs. Usually, people referred to the place as the “Book Cliff Mines.”\nThe town reached its zenith and then began a gradual decline following Wyman's death in 1910. In his will, Wyman left the town, railroad, and mines to Princeton University. Princeton managed everything for 15 years then decided to abandon it all in 1925. By the end of that summer nearly everything had been sold, dismantled, and hauled away.\nPassage 10:\nGoshen, New Hampshire\nGoshen is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 796 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\nIncorporated in 1791, Goshen was first settled in 1768 as a part of Saville (now Sunapee). The name \"Goshen\" may have been taken from Goshen, Connecticut, where many residents had relatives.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 22.5 square miles (58.4 km2), of which 22.4 square miles (58.1 km2) are land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) are water, comprising 0.41% of the town. Goshen is drained by the South Branch Sugar River and its tributaries Blood Brook and Gunnison Brook, and hence lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed. Most of the southeast part of town is drained by Cherry Brook, one of the headwaters of the Ashuelot River, a southwest-flowing tributary of the Connecticut, but a small area at the southeast corner of town has the headwaters of the east-flowing West Branch Warner River, part of the Merrimack River watershed.The long ridge of Mount Sunapee occupies the eastern edge of town. The highest point in Goshen is an unnamed knob on the ridge (near Goves Mountain) where the elevation reaches 2,529 feet (771 m) above sea level.\nNew Hampshire Route 10 passes through the western part of the town, including Goshen village, and leads north to Newport and south to Keene. New Hampshire Route 31 has its northern terminus at Route 10 and leads southeast to Hillsborough.\n\nAdjacent municipalities\nSunapee, New Hampshire (north)\nNewbury, New Hampshire (east)\nBradford, New Hampshire (southeast at one point)\nWashington, New Hampshire (south)\nLempster, New Hampshire (southwest)\nUnity, New Hampshire (west)\nNewport, New Hampshire (northwest)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 741 people, 279 households, and 219 families residing in the town.

The racial makeup of the town was 97.03% White, 1.62% Native American, 0.13% Asian, 0.13% from other races, and 1.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.40% of the population.\nThere were 279 households, out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.5% were married couples living together, 9.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.5% were non-families. 17.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 2.96.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 24.2% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 27.5% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.6% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $42,625, and the median income for a family was $45,208. Males had a median income of $33,333 versus $22,727 for females. The per capita income for the town was $20,561.  About 6.9% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.8% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEducation\nGoshen and the neighboring town of Lempster maintained a combined elementary and middle school, called Goshen-Lempster Cooperative School, located in Lempster. The school served kindergarten through 8th grade. The cooperative was dissolved in June 2016.  The majority of Goshen elementary and middle-school aged children now attend Newport, NH schools; the Newport school system now acts as the anchor system for Goshen students.\nAfter 8th grade, students are given the choice to attend several neighboring high schools, including Newport High School, Sunapee Middle-High School, and Kearsarge Regional High School.\n\nNotable people\nJohn Williams Gunnison (1812–1853), US Army officer, explorer of the American West\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nHarbor Square\nHarbor Square, formerly Shore Mall, is a shopping plaza (formerly a shopping mall) in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey in the United States on U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 originally known as \"Searstown\". The plaza is accessible from Exit 36 off the Garden State Parkway. The plaza is owned by Aetna Realty. The plaza has a gross leasable area of 337,423 ft², formerly 620,000 ft² when it was a mall, located on 73 acres (300,000 m2) of land. The plaza's anchor stores include Boscov's, Restaurant Depot and Proshot Pickleball.\n\nHistory\n1968-1988\nShore Mall originally opened in 1968 as an open-air mall called Searstown. Original anchor stores included Sears, Grant City and a Pantry Pride supermarket. Between 1971 and 1974, the mall was enclosed and expanded, with regional up-market department store Steinbach being added as a fourth anchor store. A time capsule was buried next to the Steinbach store to be opened 100 years later on March 20, 2074. Grant City was  shuttered in 1976 when the chain declared bankruptcy; by the end of the year, JCPenney opened in the former Grant City space. Pantry Pride was subsequently replaced with Foodtown, and the mall was renamed Shore Mall.\nIn 1987, Developer Kravco Company (Kravco Company LLC) and JCP Realty, the development arm of JCPenney, opened the new Hamilton Mall about 5 miles west on the Black Horse Pike (U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 322).  This caused problems with the Shore Mall, because the Sears and JCPenney anchors moved to the Hamilton Mall. With the two anchors gone, Shore Mall underwent a fair sized renovation enclosing the still open-air portion between the two anchors (pictured to the right in December 2012) as well as re-tiling the mall to its current blue and white color scheme.\nIn 1988 Clover, a discount chain owned by the Strawbridge's chain (now Macy's), soon opened in the former JCPenney/Grant City space, while Boscov's replaced the former Sears.  Circuit City opened in the former Foodtown, which closed in the early 1990s. Steinbach went out of business in 1995 but was replaced in 1996 with Value City Department Store. Clover closed in 1997 when that chain also faced closure by its parent company, becoming Burlington Coat Factory a year later.\n\n2004-2010\nIn 2004, Circuit City moved to a strip mall called Hamilton Commons near the Hamilton Mall. The Circuit City's location at the mall was replaced with a K&G Fashion Superstore in 2006 (which has since closed). Since then it has remained vacant but in 2012 it was rented by The Spirit Halloween Costume Store as a seasonal tenant. In January 2006, the Shore Mall was sold Cedar Realty Trust (Formally Cedar Shopping Centers) for $36.5 million.  Their initial plan was to \"de-mall\" the mall converting it into an open-air plaza.\nIn 2008, the Value City store at Shore Mall was among 24 locations sold by Value City's parent company to Burlington Coat Factory. The store closed on September 21, 2008 and remained vacant until it was occupied temporarily by The Community Food Bank of New Jersey in 2011-2012 while their permanent location was torn down and reconstructed.\nConstruction began in 2010 on a Golden Corral restaurant near the main entrance to the mall (where the former Dairy Queen stood, before moving into the outer building where the AT&T store and Wells Fargo bank are located) and opened in 2011.\nIn August 2010, Cedar Shopping Centers applied for a state Economic Redevelopment and Growth(ERG) grant in the amount of $3 million to $41 million. The grant would be used to help finance an $87 million revamp of the mall. The plan called for demolishing most of the mall (except Boscov's, Burlington Coat Factory, and all everything else that can be seen from the Black Horse Pike), then converting the site to a strip mall with four additional large stores. It also includes $23 million for transportation upgrades such as a reconfiguration of Exit 36 of the Garden State Parkway, an intersection between West Jersey Avenue and the Black Horse Pike, and a boulevard style road network.\n\n2012-present\nIn July 2012, Cedar Realty Trust stated that they will be razing 1/3 (over 250,000 square feet) of the mall including the former Value City location.  Most tenants will have to relocate as the space will be torn down. After demolition, Cedar Realty Trust plans to do some improvements to the location such as a new south entrance to what is remained of the main shopping center, new landscaping, parking lot improvements, and fencing off the excess land in the rear part of the property to put up for sale as vacant commercial land unless phases of new development occur under the owner.On January 28, 2013,  the Steinbach Time Capsule was dug up in a small ceremony due to demolition process needing it to be moved. The plaque and contents of the capsule were given to the Egg Harbor Township Historical Society who will create a display in remembrance of the mall at their location. Demolition continued through early-mid 2013, including the former Value City store.\nThe Motor Vehicle Commission office closed on August 23 and August 24, 2013, due to demolition of the back of the mall and the relocation to behind Boscov's which opened on August 26The center was renamed Harbor Square in October 2013. In February 2014, Cedar Realty Trust sold Harbor Square to Aetna Realty for $25 million.In early 2017 the Carrabba's was closed abruptly along with 13 others due to under performance, in Fall 2019, Burlington Coat Factory moved to Consumer Square in Mays Landing.\nIn May 2023 Restaurant Depot opened in the old Burlington Coat Factory along with Proshot Pickleball and Umi Sushi & Seafood Buffet.\n\nGallery\nPassage 2:\nSmith Road, Chennai\nSmith Road in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India branches off from Anna Salai, Chennai's arterial road near Spencer Plaza from the TVS Junction to join Whites Road near Hobart Muslim Girls Higher Secondary School.Major companies and organizations locatedbuilt during the period of the British Raj and reconstructed in 1985 on the site of the original Spencer's department store, it is the oldest shopping mall in India and was one of the biggest shopping malls in South Asia when it was built. It is one of the earliest Grade A commercial projects of the city, which were developed in the second half of the 1990s. As of March 2010, it is the 11th largest mall in the country, with a gross leasable (retail) area of 530,000 sq ft.\n\nHistory\nSpencer Plaza was built in 1863–1864, established by Charles Durant and J. W. Spencer in Anna Salai, then known as Mount Road, in the Madras Presidency. The property originally belonged to Spencer & Co Ltd. Spencer & Co opened the first department store in the Indian subcontinent in 1895. It had over 80 individual departments. After a few years, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, shifted the department store to a new building, which was an example of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The building was designed by W. N. Pogson. In 1983, the original building was destroyed in a fire.\nThe present Spencer Plaza was constructed on the same site, measuring about 10 acres, and was opened in 1991. Spread across a million square feet built in three phases with parking space for 800 cars, the plaza is a major hangout for the people of Chennai. The mall was developed by Mangal Tirth Estate Limited in January 1993.\n\nBuilding\nThe plaza is an eight-storey shopping-cum-office complex of approximately 1.068 million sq ft, consisting of nearly 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) of air-conditioned shopping units and 400,000 square feet (37,000 m2) of office units. The shopping arcade is located on the ground, first and second floors in all three phases, and the office units are spread between the fourth and the seventh floors. The car parks are spread over the basement, ground, second and third floors, in addition to double basement parking lots in the third phase of the building.The first phase of the building consists of about 300,000 sq ft, including about 125,000 sq ft of centrally air-conditioned shopping space and 100,000 sq ft of office units together with about 75,000 sq ft of service areas. The second phase consists of about 400,000 sq ft, with a provision for about 600 cars at the basement, with shops with various sizes ranging from 300 sq ft to 2,000 sq ft. The third phase covers another 300,000 sq ft. The theme of the third phase is based on colonnaded structure recreating the old Spencer's around a full-height atrium.There are over 700 shops in the plaza and over 22,000 people visit the plaza every day, with the number increasing to 40,000 on weekends and to 60,000 on festival days. The complex has three counters to keep track of footfalls. Over 20,000 two-wheelers check into the parking lot on weekends.\n\nTechnical and safety aspects\nBeing a high-rise building, the complex has a wet riser system and electronic fire alarm system installed. The underground sump has a storage capacity of 100,000 litres (22,000 imp gal; 26,000 US gal). A ring main surrounds the building from the pump room. Five wet risers run from basement to the second floor and three run from the fourth floor to the seventh floor. These risers are located at strategic points in each floor. The pump room has three pumps, one jockey pump, one main pump with an electric motor and one main pump connected with a diesel engine. The electronic fire detection system comprises smoke detectors and manual call points located in various points in common areas in all floors, sub-stations, electrical rooms, A/C plant and so forth, which are connected to a centralised computer located at the enclosures of the chief security officer. There are also many portable fire extinguishers at each floor in different locations. The rear periphery of the building has fire escape stairs, with fire escape routes displayed with signboards at various points of the building. The car ramps can also be used as fire escape routes. The building has two entrances, one from Binny Road and another from Anna Salai, for fire engines.Fire safety includes a water capacity of 1.2 million litres, fire sprinklers, smoke and heat detection systems and fire extinguishers. The in-house fire department has six firemen per shift.\n\nShops\nThe mall hosts major anchor stores such as Westside (spread across 20,000 sq ft) and Landmark (40,000 sq ft), and several local and international brands such as Nike, Adidas, Bata, Regal, Health & Glow, Vummidiars, Van Heusen, Proline, Allen Solly, Florshaim shoes, Lipton, Louis Philippe, Titan, Levi's, Casio, V.I.P. Luggage, Spencer & Co (40,000 sq ft on the ground, first and second floors), Timex Watch Showroom, Swatch, Cookie Man, BPL (Profx), Color Plus, Navigator, Witco, Pantaloons (26,000 sq ft), Arrow, Lee, Music World (now closed), Food World, HSBC, ABN AMRO, American Express, Citibank (65,000 sq ft in second and third phases), First Flight and Du Bowl (16,000 sq ft). McDonald's, the world's largest fast food chain, has established an outlet.\n\nOn 26 February 2004, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB) established a trade centre at the complex at a cost of ₹17 million. The Sri Lanka Trade Centre is spread over 20,000 sq ft on the first floor at the third phase of the building. Seventeen frontline Sri Lankan companies display apparel, artificial flowers, confectionaries, footwear and leather products, gems and jewellery, herbal products, light engineering products, porcelain, tableware, Ceylon tea and toys.\n\nIncidents\nOn 4 September 2008, a fire erupted on the first floor of the building's first phase around 10:20 p.m. local time, perhaps due to a short circuit. A garment shop was burned in the incident. With the help of 12 water tenders and 9 fire tenders, the fire was extinguished within 30 minutes, and no casualties were reported. The firemen had easy access to the spot, mainly due to the setback space available inside the building.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBrett Scallions\nBrett Allen Scallions (born December 21, 1971) is an American singer. He is best known for being the original lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the alternative rock band Fuel from 1993 to 2006 and then from 2010 to 2020. During that time, the band released four major-label albums including the double platinum Something Like Human. His initial stint with the band ended in February 2006. Scallions has been ranked in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader (#50).\n\nEarly life\nScallion was born in Brownsville, Tennessee. As a child, he listened to Elvis records. He would sing in choir in church and was cast as lead actor in plays throughout his high school. He was awarded scholarships to Lambuth University for music and theater.\n\nCareer\nFuel\nScallions joined Fuel in 1993 after bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw him perform in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee. The band achieved its greatest success with Scallions as lead singer. Scallions later moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania with the rest of the band where they would perform at local bars and nightclubs under the name Real 2 Reel.\n\nWorld Fire Brigade\nOutside Re-Fueled, Scallions was busy with Sean Danielsen of Smile Empty Soul and producer Eddie Wohl, writing and recording an album under the name World Fire Brigade. \"It's much heavier than anything I ever did with Fuel,\" Scallions said of World Fire Brigade's sound in August 2009. \"We've done a lot of stuff in lower tones which is a first for me also, it's very deep, heavy, and even growly at times.\" He also said that the World Fire Brigade album was \"almost three-quarters of the way complete, and planned to be released early next spring, fingers crossed\". Two new tracks \"Shot Down\" and \"Take Me Away\" were available on MySpace since March 2011. The album is currently available for streaming through Riptide Music website (under working title Weight of the World).The debut album titled Spreading My Wings was released by FrostByte Media Inc. on August 28, 2012.The World Fire Brigade line-up consisted of Scallions (vocals/guitar), Sean Danielsen (vocals/guitar), and Eddie Wohl (keyboards). Guest musicians on the album included former Candiria drummer Ken Schalk, Mike McCready (Pearl Jam), Rob Caggiano (Anthrax), and Andy Andersson (Black Robot). Brad Stewart had been announced as the group's touring bassist. Even though he recorded bass tracks for the album, Scallions had stated that he will be playing rhythm guitar when the group goes on tour.\nOn April 3, 2013, the following message was posted on the World Fire Brigade Facebook page:\n\"Thanks to everyone that has discovered our music and has questions about touring and new music. Right now we're all too busy with our other bands to tour, but that doesn't mean it will never happen.\" The post went on to invite fans to support the bands Fuel and Smile Empty Soul \"on the road all year\".\n\nPost-Fuel / other projects\nAfter leaving Fuel, Scallions joined bands with The X's and Circus Diablo playing bass. Both bands ultimately became one-album projects and concluded shortly after subsequent tours.\nIn March 2007, Scallions was selected as the lead singer for Riders on the Storm, a project featuring former members of The Doors, Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek.\nBrett Scallions contributed lead vocals to the charity single \"Something to Believe\", released by the band Hollow on iTunes via Koch Records on March 9, 2010.\n\nDeparture and return to Fuel\nScallions left Fuel in early 2006. According to an interview with Alternative Addition, Scallions cited the reason due to the band becoming a \"one-man band\" throughout the years. The three remaining members of the band, however, chose to continue with new vocalist Toryn Green. With Green, Fuel would record one unsuccessful album, 2007's Angels & Devils and would largely be inactive by 2008 due to legal issues with their then-label Epic Records.During Fuel's inactivity, Scallions and bassist Jeff Abercrombie teamed up for the first time since Scallions' departure in 2006 to tour as \"Re-Fueled\". Scallions and Abercrombie recruited guitarist Yogi Lonich of Chris Cornell and Buckcherry fame and drummer Ken Schalk, formerly of Candiria to round out the unit. Their debut performance was a free event that took place on August 28, 2009 at the Tempe Marketplace, playing songs from the Sunburn and Something Like Human albums exclusively.Still without word from the official incarnation of Fuel and with Re-Fueled increasing its tour schedule, speculation surrounding the future for Fuel began to increase including some confusion on the part of vocalist Toryn Green. Green explained he had not heard anything from the other members, but expressed his support for seeing Scallions back on stage singing classic Fuel songs again.  Finally, On April 8, 2010, it was announced that Re-Fueled had disbanded, and that original guitarist/songwriter Carl Bell, and bassist Jeff Abercrombie had left Fuel to pursue other endeavors. Toryn Green and drummer Tommy Stewart left the band as well. On the same day, Brett Scallions reformed Fuel with Lonich, Schalk, and former Shinedown bassist Brad Stewart.\nA couple of new songs worked their way into Fuel's live sets between 2010 and 2013, beginning with a track titled \"Headache\", and in March 2012 it was announced that Fuel intended to release a new album, which would be the first Fuel contribution to include Scallions since 2003's Natural Selection. By the end of April 2013, tracking for the new album had been completed and the band promised that a new single was soon to come.\nOn December 5, 2013, the first new track from the forthcoming Puppet Strings album was unveiled, and the first official single was set for a January 2014 release with the album release to follow on March 4.In June 2014, the album release was followed-up with the song \"Cold Summer\" being released as a single. Scallions has stated that he penned the song during his original tenure in Fuel, somewhere around 2002. Originally known as \"Hit and Sorry\", he recalls having recorded it so many times he almost gave up on the track. After adding a new chorus with contributions from producer Eddie Wohl and consulting the opinions of his bandmates, the decision was made to include the song on the album.In 2015, Scallions embarked on his first unplugged tour. He performed Fuel songs as well as covering some of his favorite songs that were seminal in his musical journey.\nScallions again chose to leave Fuel after internal conflictsat dizzying speeds\".\n\nLegacy\nIn the words of British dramatist and novelist Philip Norman, \"the only point concerning Mick Jagger's influence over 'young people' that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasn't, under any circumstances, fundamentally harmless\". According to Norman, even Elvis Presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a \"power so wholly and disturbingly physical\". \"[W]hile [Presley] made girls scream, [he] did not have Jagger's ability to make men feel uncomfortable.\" Norman likens Jagger in his early performances with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s to a male ballet dancer, with \"his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece\".His performance style has been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. Musicologist Sheila Whiteley noted that Jagger's performance style \"opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture\". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of acting—which creates a question about the singer's relationship to his own words.His voice has been described as a powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express \"virility and unrestrained passion\" he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as \"the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound\". Steven Van Zandt wrote: \"The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird—even Bob Dylan.\"Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry. Jagger is often described as one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll; in 1994 the New York Times noted that his \"influence hangs heavily over contemporary British rock\" as many singers \"incorporated elements\" of his onstage presence into their personas. In 2015, Billboard ranked him among the best rock frontmen of all time, referring to him as \"the rock and roll frontman\" whose \"swagger brought a style and sexiness to rock music that he built on for decades\" and openly wondering \"would we even have rock stars without Mick?\"Musician David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk, and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: \"I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger.\" Bowie  suggested, \"I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image.\" Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone's List of 100 Greatest Singers at No. 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: \"I sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection.\" This edition also cites Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop. Jagger also has been known to seek out newcomer artists to the music industry and advise them.The Telegraph has called Mick Jagger \"the Rolling Stone who changed music\". CNN has called Jagger's \"greatest talent, besides strutting and singing\" his \"ability to surround himself and the rest of the band with a group of very able executives.\"As Jagger has aged, his continued vitality has provoked comment. Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi said: \"I can't get over it...I'm...dying already and I'm gonna go out there and play four songs. How do they do it?\" Since his early career Jagger has embodied what some authors describe as a \"Dionysian archetype\" of \"eternal youth\" personified by many rock stars and the rock culture.Jagger has repeatedly said that he will not write an autobiography, but according to John Blake, after a slew of unauthorised biographies, Jagger was persuaded by Lord Weidenfeld in the early 1980s to prepare his own for a £1 million advance. The resulting 75,000-word manuscript is held by Blake, who briefly planned to publish it until Jagger withdrew support.\"Mick Jagger is the least egotistical person,\" observed Watts in 2008. \"He'll do what's right for the band. He's not a big head—and, if he was, he went through it thirty years ago.\"\n\nDiscography\nSolo studio albums\nFilmography\nAs actor\nJagger was slated to appear in the 1982 film Fitzcarraldo and some scenes were shot with him, but he had to leave for a Rolling Stones tour and his character was eliminated.\n\nAs producer\nRunning Out of Luck (1987)\nEnigma (2001)\nBeing Mick (2001)\nThe Women (2008)\nGet on Up (2014)\nMr. Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown (2014)\nVinyl (2016)\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nDisease (song)\n\"Disease\" is the first single released from American rock band Matchbox Twenty's third album, More Than You Think You Are. The track was co-written by Matchbox Twenty lead singer Rob Thomas and Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. Released on September 30, 2002, the song peaked at number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Disease\" was one of two songs written by Thomas and presented to Jagger while he was producing his solo album Goddess in the Doorway, alongside \"Visions of Paradise\". Jagger returned \"Disease\" to Thomas, saying \"It sounds like you. It's your song.\"\n\nMusic video\nThe video, directed by Phil Harder, starts with a man turning on his colorful boomboxing, then roller skating over a wide section of New York City, amid images of the band illuminated on moving billboards. During the second chorus, we see the band performing in a large outdoor roller-rink, complete with a disco ball. They are surrounded by a crowd dancing along, and to begin the 3rd chorus, Rob slides off the stage on all fours onto the dance floor past the crowd. At the end of the song, the roller skater shuts off his beat box and then proceeds up some stairs, presumably to his home.\n\nTrack listings\nCharts\nRelease history\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

This version of her song does not appear.\n\nDubplate Drama\nDubplate Drama is a British television series that aired on Channel 4 between 11 November 2005 and 3 July 2009. The show was created by Luke Hyamms, Shystie and her manager. The premise of the series involved a group of young musicians, with the leading role by Shystie, who was attempting to make it big by securing a record deal. Three series of the show were broadcast. The first series contained six fifteen-minute episodes, the second contained six thirty-minute episodes, and the third contained two feature-length specials of sixty minutes each.

He was reputed to be the father of Sequoyah the famous Cherokee by Wurteh Watts. Like his father Christopher Gist (1706–1759), he served in Braddock's Expedition in 1755 and the Forbes Expedition in 1758. The outbreak of the American Revolution found him on the frontier. At first suspected of sympathizing with the British, he convinced the Americans of his loyalty.\nGeorge Washington, a close friend of his father, authorized him to form Gist's Additional Continental Regiment in January 1777. Gist probably participated in Light Horse Harry Lee's Paulus Hook Raid in 1779. He and his regiment were captured at the Siege of Charleston in May 1780. After the war, he took an American wife Judith Cary Bell (1750–1833) and the couple had four daughters, one of whom married Francis P. Blair. He is variously said to have died in 1796, 1812, or at the end of the War of 1812. He is confused with his uncle Nathaniel Gist (1707–1780). He was a first cousin of Mordecai Gist.\n\nFrench and Indian War\nBorn on 15 October 1733 in Baltimore, Province of Maryland, Gist's parents were Christopher Gist (1706–1759) and Sarah Howard (b. 1711Rifles)\nSahagun, December 1808 (The Light Dragoons)\nVitoria, 21 June 1813: The Village of Gamara Mayor carried by the 4th, 47th and 59th Regiments of General Robinson's Brigade (Nuneaton Art Gallery)\nSt. Sebastian, August 1813 (Regimental Museum, King's Own Royal Regiment, Lancaster)\nSalamanca (Regimental Museum, King's Own Royal Regiment, Lancaster)\nThe Passage of the Bidassoa by Wellington's Army, 7 October 1813 (1908 - Queen's Royal Hussars)\nNapoleon's last inspection at Waterloo\n\"1815.\" The Captive Eagle.

Like their contemporaries The Last Poets, the group combined elements of jazz music and spoken-word performance, making the trio one that is often seen as a forerunner of contemporary hip-hop music. \nFormed in 1967, the group comprised Richard Dedeaux, Fr Amde Hamilton (born Anthony Hamilton), and Otis O'Solomon (also billed as Otis O'Solomon Smith) (O'Solomon removed the \"Smith\" from his name in the 1970s). Hamilton is the last surviving member as of March 2022.\n\nHistory\nHamilton, O'Solomon, and Dedeaux first met and collaborated at the Watts Writers Workshop, an organization created by Budd Schulberg in the wake of the Watts Riots, as the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to take a new cultural turn. Fusing music with jazz and funk roots, and rapid-fire, spoken-word poetry, they created a sound that gave them a considerable local following. They released two albums, 1969's The Black Voices: On the Streets in Watts and 1971's Rappin' Black in a White World, which established a strong tendency toward social commentary and a reputation for militancy. The group was unable to secure another record deal; a promising deal with Bob Marley's Tuff Gong label famously fell through. Unable to sustain success, the group has performed only sporadically since the mid-1970s.\nIn recent years, the group's profile has improved somewhat. The 1997 recording, When the 90's Came, found them in the studio with pianist Horace Tapscott, and a European tour reunited the trio with former collaborator DeeDee McNeil. In 2005, Things Gonna Get Greater: The Watts Prophets 1969-1971 combined the group's first two efforts, bringing them back into print for the first time in more than a decade.\nAmde Hamilton, who is now a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, can be seen performing a spoken-word piece at the 1981 funeral service of Bob Marley in Jamaica in the 1982 film Land of Look Behind. He also claims to have baptized Nina Simone (who was later funeralized in a Catholic church—the faith in which Hamilton was raised).\nIn 1994, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool, appearing on a track entitled \"Apprehension\" alongside Don Cherry (trumpeter). The album, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in African-American society was named \"Album of the Year\" by Time Magazine.Richard Dedeaux died in December 2013. O'Solomon died in March 2022.\n\nDiscography\n1969 - The Black Voices: On the Streets in Watts\n1971 - Rappin' Black in a White World\n1997 - When the 90's Came\n2005 - Things Gonna Get Greater: The Watts Prophets 1969-1971 (compilation)\n\nSee also\nThe Last Poets\nGil Scott-Heron\nPassage 10:\nAngela Lonsdale\nAngela Lonsdale (née Smith; 13 October 1967) is an English actress.\n\nBiography\nBorn to a policeman father, Lonsdale trained at Brewery Youth Theatre at the Brewery Arts Centre, Kendal. She took part in a large number of amateur productions, including plays by local playwrights John Newman-Holden and Tim Bull. After initial rejection, Lonsdale then graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Lonsdale is best known for playing police officer Emma Taylor on Coronation Street, later the wife of Curly Watts. Both characters left the programme in 2003.\nShe then took a regular part in the long-running television series The Bill. Lonsdale appeared as DI Eva Moore in the daytime BBC series Doctors. She left in October 2008, after her character was shot and presumed dead. She made a brief return to Doctors in September 2011.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThe Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)\nThe Lives of a Bengal Lancer is a 1935 American adventure film starring Gary Cooper, directed by Henry Hathaway, and written by Grover Jones, William Slavens McNutt, Waldemar Young, John L. Balderston, and Achmed Abdullah. The setting and title come from the 1930 autobiography of the British soldier Francis Yeats-Brown.\nThe story, which has little in common with Yeats-Brown’s book, tells of a group of British cavalrymen and high-ranking officers desperately trying to defend their stronghold and headquarters at Bengal against the rebellious natives during the days of the British Raj. Cooper plays Lieutenant Alan McGregor, Franchot Tone, Lieutenant John Forsythe, Richard Cromwell, Lieutenant Donald Stone, Guy Standing, Colonel Tom Stone, and Douglass Dumbrille plays the rebel leader Mohammed Khan, who reads the now often-misquoted line \"We have ways to make men talk.\"The film was produced by released by Paramount Pictures. Planning began in 1931, and Paramount had expected the film to be released that same year. However, most of the location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures, and the project was delayed. It was eventually released in the US in 1935.\nIt met with positive reviews and good box office results, and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Assistant Director, with other nominations including Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. The film grossed $1.5 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.\n\nPlot\nOn the northwest frontier of India during the British Raj, Scottish Canadian  Lieutenant Alan McGregor  (Gary Cooper), in charge of newcomers, welcomes two replacements to the 41st Bengal Lancers: Lieutenant John Forsythe  (Franchot Tone) and  Lieutenant Donald Stone  (Richard Cromwell), the son of the unit's commander, Colonel Tom Stone  (Guy Standing). Lieutenant Stone, a \"cub\" (meaning a newly commissioned officer), eagerly anticipated serving on the Indian frontier, particularly because he specifically was requested and assumed that his father sent for him; Lieutenant Forsythe, an experienced cavalrymen and something of a teasing character, was sent out as a replacement for an officer who was killed in action. \nAfter his arrival Lieutenant Stone discovers that his father keeps him at arms length, wanting to treat him the same as he treats all of the other men. He also reveals that he did not request his son serve in his regiment, a discovery that breaks his heart and leads to him going on a drunken bender. Attempting to show impartiality, the colonel treats his son indifferently. The Colonel's commitment to strictly military behavior and adherence to protocol is interpreted by young Stone as rejection. He had not seen his father since he was a boy and had looked forward to spending time with him.\nLieutenant Barrett (Colin Tapley), disguised as a native rebel in order to spy on Mohammed Khan (Douglass Dumbrille), reports that Khan is preparing an uprising against the British. He plans to intercept and hijack a military convoy transporting two million rounds of ammunition. When Khan discovers that Colonel Stone knows of his plan, he orders Tania Volkanskaya, a beautiful Russian agent, to seduce and kidnap Lieutenant Stone in an attempt to extract classified information about the ammunition caravan from him, or use him as leverage to attract his father. When the colonel refuses to attempt his son's rescue, McGregor and Forsythe, appalled by the seeming lack of concern the colonel has for his own son, leave the camp at night without orders. Disguised as native merchants trying to sell blankets, they successfully get inside Khan's fortress. However, they are recognized by Tania, who had met the two men at a social event. McGregor and Forsythe are taken prisoner.\nDuring interrogation, Khan wants to know when and where the munitions will be transported so that he can attack and steal the arms. He has the prisoners tortured for the information. Bamboo shoots are shoved under their fingernails and set on fire. McGregor and Forsythe refuse to talk, but the demoralized Stone, feeling rejected by his father, cracks and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition convoy is captured.\nAfter receiving news of the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone takes the 41st to battle Khan. From their cell, the captives see the overmatched Bengal Lancers deploy to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and blow up the ammunition tower, McGregor manning a machine gun and dying in the assault. Young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone, their leader dead, and their fortress in ruins, the remaining rebels surrender.\nIn recognition of their bravery and valor in battle, Lieutenants Forsythe and Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order. McGregor posthumously receives the Victoria Cross, Great Britain's highest award for military valor, with Colonel Stone pinning the medal to the saddle cloth of McGregor's horse in the custom in the 41st Lancers.\n\nCast\nGary Cooper as  Lieutenant Alan McGregor, a highly experienced officer in his mid-thirties, who has spent a long time with the regiment. McGregor, a Canadian, is portrayed as a charming, open character who befriends most officers, but because of disregard for his superiors and habit of speaking his mind is regarded askance by his superiors, who nevertheless respect his military abilities.\nFranchot Tone as  Lieutenant John Forsythe, an upper-class cavalryman in his mid-twenties from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Transferred from the Blues, one of the two regiments at the time the movie was made tasked with guarding the Sovereign, Forsythe is presented as the  funny guy  of the main characters, and is noteworthy for his Sandhurst style in military exercise, something that earns him countless compliments from his superiors.Richard Cromwell as  Lieutenant Donald Stone, a recent graduate of Sandhurst and a very young officer. As the son of a colonel with a famous name, he is treated respectfully but becomes frustrated and morose because of personal issues with his father.\nGuy Standing  as  Colonel Tom Stone, a long-serving colonel who left his home in Britain to serve on the Frontier, and explains to his son in the film that the \"service always comes first ... something your mother never understood.\" He is considered to be a dyed-in-the-wool, by-the-book colonel who suppresses his feelings and never does anything without orders.\nC. Aubrey Smith as  Major Hamilton, an old, very experienced major who serves as Colonel Stone's adjutant and Lieutenant Stone's second father and friend. He, along with his chief, planned and coordinated the big assault on Mohammad Khan's fortress.\nKathleen Burke as  Tania Volkanskaya, a beautiful and seductive young Russian woman who is Khan's ally. She is used as Khan's secret ace, who seduces young men when needed to forward Khanner (June 1982); a book of original production artwork by Syd Mead, Mentor Huebner, Charles Knode, Michael Kaplan, and Ridley Scott as Blade Runner Sketchbook (1982); and The Blade Runner Portfolio (1982), a collection of twelve photographic prints, similar to the artist portfolios released by their Schanes & Schanes imprint.There are two video games based on the film, both titled Blade Runner: one from 1985, a side-scrolling video game for Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC by CRL Group PLC, which is marked as \"a video game interpretation of the film score by Vangelis\" rather than of the film itself (due to licensing issues); and another from 1997, a point-and-click adventure for PC by Westwood Studios. The 1997 game has a non-linear plot based in the Blade Runner world, non-player characters that each ran in their own independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, J. F. Sebastian and Howie Lee appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors, with the exception of Gaff, who is replaced by Javier Grajeda (as Victor Gardell) and Howie Lee, who is replaced by Toru Nagai. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard.The television film (and later series) Total Recall 2070 was initially planned as a spin-off of the film Total Recall (based on Philip K. Dick's short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\"), but was produced as a hybrid of Total Recall and Blade Runner. Many similarities between Total Recall 2070 and Blade Runner were noted, as well as apparent influences on the show from Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel and the TV series Holmes & Yoyo.\n\nDocumentaries\nThe film has been the subject of several documentaries.\n\nBlade Runner: Convention Reel (1982, 13 minutes)\nCo-directed by Muffet Kaufman and Jeffrey B. Walker, shot and screened in 16 mm, featured no narrator, was filmed in 1981 while Blade Runner was still in production and featured short \"behind-the-scenes\" segments showing sets being built and sequences being shot, as well as interviews with Ridley Scott, Syd Mead and Douglas Trumbull. Appears on the Blade Runner Ultimate Collector's Edition.On the Edge of Blade Runner (2000, 55 minutes)\nDirected by Andrew Abbott and hosted/written by Mark Kermode. Interviews with production staff, including Scott, give details of the creative process and the turmoil during preproduction. Insights into Philip K. Dick and the origins of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? are provided by Paul M. Sammon and Hampton Fancher.\nFuture Shocks (2003, 27 minutes)\nDirected by TVOntario. It includes interviews with executive producer Bud Yorkin, Syd Mead, and the cast, and commentary by science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer and from film critics.\nDangerous Days: Making Blade Runner (2007, 213 minutes)\nDirected and produced by Charles de Lauzirika for The Final Cut version of the film. Its source material comprises more than 80 interviews, including extensive conversations with Ford, Young, and Scott. The documentary is presented in eight chapters, with each of the first seven covering a portion of the filmmaking process. The final chapter examines Blade Runner's controversial legacy.\nAll Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut (2007, 29 minutes)\nProduced by Paul Prischman, appears on the Blade Runner Ultimate Collector's Edition and provides an overview of the film's multiple versions and their origins, as well as detailing the seven-year-long restoration, enhancement and remastering process behind The Final Cut.\n Blade Runner Phenomenon (2021, 53 minutes)\nDirected by Boris Hars-Tschachotin and made by the France and Germany European public service channel ARTE, this documentary informs viewers using behind-the-scenes material from various sets, photos, original locations in Los Angeles, and interviews with those involved in the production.\n\nSequel and related media\nA sequel was released in 2017, titled Blade Runner 2049, with Ryan Gosling alongside Ford in the starring roles. It entered production in mid-2016 and is set decades after the first film. Harrison Ford reprised his role as Rick Deckard. The film won two Academy Awards, for cinematography and visual effects.The world of Blade Runner has also come to be explored in animation. Blade Runner 2049 was preceded by the release of three short films that served as prequels, where the chronological first, Blade Runner Black Out 2022, was anime (the other two, 2036: Nexus Dawn and 2048: Nowhere to Run, were live action, not animated).In November 2021, a Japanese-American anime television series called Blade Runner: Black Lotus was released. The series tells the story of a female replicant protagonist, rather than that of a male Blade Runner one.Dick's friend K. W. Jeter wrote three authorized Blade Runner novels that continue Rick Deckard's story, attempting to resolve the differences between the film and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? These are Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995), Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996), and Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000)\nBlade Runner cowriter David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier, which he referred to as a \"sidequel\" or spiritual successor to the original film; the two are set in a shared universe. A bonus feature on the Blu-ray for Prometheus, the 2012 film by Scott set in the Alien universe, states that Eldon Tyrell, CEO of the Blade Runner Tyrell Corporation, was the mentor of Guy Pearce's character Peter Weyland.In late 2022, Amazon announced a Blade Runner 2049 sequel series would be produced. On October 12, 2022, an apparent official approval to actually make a Blade Runner 2099 TV series was reported.\n\nSee also\nBlade Runner (franchise)\nArcology\nBiorobotics\nList of dystopian films\nList of fictional robots and androids\nSynthetic biology\nTech noir\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nA Wise Old Owl\n\"A Wise Old Owl\" is an English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7734 and in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, 2nd Ed. of 1997, as number 394. The rhyme is an improvement of a traditional nursery rhyme \"There was an owl lived in an oak, wisky, wasky, weedle.\"\n\nLyrics\nThis version was first published in Punch, April 10, 1875, and ran as follows.\n\nOne version was published upon bookmarks during the mid-1930s, and goes as follows:\n\nThe 1875 version is ungrammatical from the standpoint of modern English, relying on an apo koinou construction for meter; this is also used in a children's song called Bingo.\n\nHistory\nThe rhyme refers to the traditional image of owls as the symbol of wisdom. It was recorded as early as 1875 and is apparently older than that. It was quoted by John D. Rockefeller in 1909 and is frequently misattributed to Edward Hersey Richards and William R. Cubbage.During World War II, the United States army used the rhyme on a poster with the tweaked ending, \"Soldier.... be like that old bird!\" with the caption \"Silence means security.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 2:\nAiken Drum\n\"Aiken Drum\" (Roud 2571) is a popular Scottish folk song and nursery rhyme, which probably has its origins in a Jacobite song about the Battle of Sheriffmuir (1715).\n\nLyrics\nModern versions of the lyrics include:\n\nOther versions of the song include the lyrics:\n\nOrigins\nThe rhyme was first printed by James Hogg in Jacobite Reliques in 1820, as a Jacobite song about the Battle of Sheriffmuir (1715):\n\nSir Walter Scott in his novel The Antiquary (1816) refers to Aiken Drum in a story told by an old beggar about the origins of what has been perceived by the protagonist as a Roman fort. The beggar tells him that it was actually built by him and others for \"auld Aiken Drum's bridal\" and that one of the masons cut the shape of a ladle into the stone as a joke on the bridegroom. The reference suggests that the rhyme, and particularly the chorus, was well enough known in the early nineteenth century for the joke to be understood.\n\nPerformances\nThe Scottish folk group The Singing Kettle performs this song for children in an interactive way by allowing the children to decide the foods of which Aiken Drum is made. A version is included on their CD Singalong Songs from Scotland, produced in 2003 for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.Popular Armenian-Canadian children's singer Raffi played a version of the song, called \"Aikendrum\", on his album Singable Songs for the Very Young (1976). Raffi's version of the song replaces the various foods with ones that would be more familiar to an American audience: spaghetti for Aikendrum's hair, meatballs for his eyes, cheese for his nose, and pizza for his mouth. This version was also the Barney & Friends version.\nThe album Classic Scots Ballads (1961) by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger includes a recording of this song with the original lyrics.\n\nThe Brownie of Blednoch\nAiken Drum is also the name given by the Scottish poet William Nicholson to the brownie in his poem \"The Brownie of Blednoch\" (1828). The poem incorporates traditional brownie legends, but there is no evidence of the name being used for a brownie prior to Nicholson.\n\nIn popular culture\nAiken Drum is the name chosen for one of the main characters in the science fiction series The Saga of Pliocene Exile.\n\nSee also\nPassage 3:\nRow, Row, Row Your Boat\n\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" is an English language nursery rhyme and a popular children's song, often sung in a round. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19236.\nBing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). Crosby also used the song as part of a round with his family during his concert at the London Palladium in 1976. The performance was captured on the album Bing Crosby Live at the London Palladium.\n\nLyrics\nThe most common modern version is often sung as a round for up to four voice parts (play ). A possible arrangement for SATB is as follows:\n\n The text above is often sung multiple times in succession to allow for the different voices to interweave with each other, forming four-part harmony.\n\nMelody\nOrigins\nThe earliest printing of the song is from 1852, when the lyrics were published with similar lyrics to those used today, but with a very different tune. It was reprinted again two years later with the same lyrics and another tune. The modern tune was first recorded with the lyrics in 1881, mentioning Eliphalet Oram Lyte in The Franklin Square Song Collection but not making it clear whether he was the composer or adapter.\n\nLegacy and alternative versions\nThe nursery rhyme is well known, appearing in several films, e.g. Star Trek V, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Manos: The Hands of Fate. People often add additional verses, a form of children's street culture, with the intent of either extending the song or (especially in the case of more irreverent versions) to make it funny, parody it, or substitute another sensibility for the perceived innocent one of the original. In Bean, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) and Peter MacNicol (David Langley) also used this parody singing in the film.  Don Music, a muppet character in Sesame Street, changed the lyrics to feature a car instead of a boat.In addition, Aimee Mann included a brief interpolation in \"Choice in the matter\" from her second solo album \"I'm with stupid\".\nVersions include:\n\nand\nand\n and\nand\nand\nand\nand\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 4:\nPretty Little Dutch Girl\n\"Pretty Little Dutch Girl\" is a children's nursery rhyme, clapping game and jump-rope rhyme. \tIt has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 12986.\n\nLyrics\nThe lyrics of the song vary considerably. British versions of this rhyme differ significantly, perhaps because many of the allusions in the rhyme were unknown to British children at the time. Common versions include:\n\nI am a pretty little Dutch girl,\nAs pretty as I can be, be, be,\nAnd all the boys in the baseball team\nGo crazy over me, me, me.My boy friend’s name is Fatty,\nHe comes from the SenorattiLewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice Found There (1871). Carroll, having introduced two fat little men named Tweedledee and Tweedledum, quotes the nursery rhyme, which the two brothers then go on to enact. They agree to have a battle, but never have one. When they see a monstrous black crow swooping down, they take to their heels. The Tweedle brothers never contradict each other, even when one of them, according to the rhyme, \"agrees to have a battle\". Rather, they complement each other's words, which led John Tenniel to portray them as twins in his illustrations for the book.\n\nOther depictions\nTweedledee and Tweedledum appear in Disney's 1951 version of Alice in Wonderland, both voiced by J. Pat O'Malley, and representing the sun and moon as they tell Alice the story of The Walrus and the Carpenter, and the first stanza of the poem called, You Are Old, Father William before Alice quietly leaves to find the White Rabbit. The Disney versions of the characters later appeared in the Disney television series House of Mouse and one of them in the final scene of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\nTweedledee and Tweedledum appear in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, portrayed by Ben Cotton and Matty Finochio. They appear as the Red Queen's servants where they started out working for the Red King. While Tweedledum is shown to be loyal to the Red Queen, Tweedledee is shown to be loyal to Jafar.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 10:\nWhat Are Little Girls Made Of?\n\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" is the seventh episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series, Star Trek. Written by Robert Bloch and directed by James Goldstone, it first aired on October 20, 1966.\nIn the episode, Nurse Chapel searches for her long lost fiancé and uncovers his secret plan to create sophisticated androids for galactic conquest.\nThe first episode of the series to be repeated on NBC, the title of the episode is taken from the fourth line of the 19th-century nursery rhyme, \"What Are Little Boys Made Of?\"\n\nPlot\nThe USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain Kirk, travels to the icy planet Exo-III to search for the exobiologist Dr. Roger Korby. Korby was the fiancé of Dr. McCoy's temporary assistant, Nurse Christine Chapel, who signed on to the Enterprise to search for Korby.\nAt Korby's request, Kirk and Chapel beam down alone to a cavern entrance, but Korby is not there to meet them. Finding this suspicious, Kirk has two security officers beamed down from the Enterprise. One is instructed to stay at the entrance and keep a lookout, and the other accompanies Kirk and Chapel. The three begin to descend into a system of caves. When passing over a deep chasm, the security officer disappears. Shortly after, they meet Korby's aide Dr. Brown. Chapel recognizes him but is surprised the man does not remember her. Brown assures them that the security officer fell by accident, and the three continue on. Kirk contacts the remaining security officer and tells him to contact the Enterprise for reinforcements, but a strange creature kills the officer before he gets the chance. Meanwhile, Kirk, Chapel and Brown find Korby, who tells them that the caves were left by an extinct race. Korby shows Kirk and Chapel machinery that creates androids. With the help of Ruk, a still-functioning android from the time of the original inhabitants, Korby has created more androids, one being a beautiful woman he calls \"Andrea\". Brown is also an android. It is also revealed that Ruk had killed the security officers.\nKorby creates an android duplicate of Kirk as Chapel looks on. As Kirk's personality is imprinted on the android, the real Kirk imagines himself insulting Spock as a \"half-breed\". Korby has the duplicate Kirk beamed aboard the Enterprise with orders to identify a planet suitable for creating more androids. When Spock questions the Kirk-android's orders, it repeats the insult Kirk had used. Spock, realizing that this is not Kirk, forms a security team to follow the Kirk-android back down to Exo-III. When it reaches the planet, the Kirk-android encounters Andrea, thinking it is the real Kirk, destroys him when he refuses to kiss her.\nThe real Kirk convinces Ruk that Korby is a threat to his existence. Ruk begins to recall the clash between the \"Old Ones\" and the androids that led to his civilization's demise centuries ago. Korby enters, and Ruk confronts him, but Korby destroys Ruk with a phaser. Shortly afterward, in a struggle with Kirk, the skin of Korby's hand is torn, revealing that he is also an android.\nIt is now revealed that Korby, dying of frostbite, had transferred his mind to an android body. He begs Chapel to believe that he is still the same man, but Chapel is repelled by what he has done to himself. Andrea, realizing she loves Korby, kisses him, and in despair, Korby fires Andrea's weapon between the embracing pair, destroying them both.\nSpock arrives with the security force, but finds that the crisis has passed. When Spock inquires about Dr. Korby's whereabouts, Kirk replies, \"Dr. Korby was never here.\" Chapel decides to stay on with the Enterprise and finish out her tour of duty. Spock tells Kirk about his dismay of using the term \"half-breed\" to warn that something was wrong. The captain says he will remember this should he find himself in a \"similar situation.\"\n\nProduction\nThe episode was written by Robert Bloch, but received rewrites during shooting by Gene Roddenberry. The director of the second pilot \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", James Goldstone, was hired to direct this episode, but due to problems with the script, shooting went two days over schedule and Goldstone was not re-hired.Sherry Jackson, who plays the android woman Andrea, said that they had a censor on set to make sure that her costume fully covered her breasts and that side cleavage was not visible. She also said of William Shatner, \"I must say when he kissed me on screen, he really kissed me!\" and that Shatner's chest had to be shaved for his nude scenes in the android machine because Gene Roddenberry felt that Captain Kirk would not be hairy.Reference to the works of H. P. Lovecraft was briefly made in Bloch's script, with its mention of \"the Old Ones\" and the look of the trapezoidal doors in the caverns.\n\nReception\nZack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"B+\" rating, noting that the \"repetitive plotting\" took away any real sense of threat and that without Spock or McCoy to play off, Kirk's character is less interesting.\n\nSee also\nShip of Theseus\nAllegiance (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\nRedshirt (stock character)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The song \"Center Stage\" was featured on ESPN's First Take where they played a short segment of the retro-sounding track before going to commercial breaks.\nThe band's debut album, In a Tidal Wave of Mystery, was released June 4, 2013 via Capitol Records in partnership with Lazy Hooks. It was the first release of new material on Capitol with a Universal Music Group catalog number. The album debuted at number sixty-six on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nHistory\nThe two musicians met after Merchant responded to Simonian's open ad on Craigslist offering his production services. They began jingle-writing together. After three years successfully  composing music for commercials and advertising campaigns, the duo formed Capital Cities. The band released its debut, self-titled EP in June 2011 via their label, Lazy Hooks.\nIn 2012, the band signed with Capitol Records. In partnership with Lazy Hooks, the label released In a Tidal Wave of Mystery, the band's debut album, on June 4, 2013. The album takes its name from the lyrics of its top 10 Modern Rock radio hit \"Safe and Sound\",  the album's first single. The song has been used in promotional campaigns for HBO, Smart Car, Microsoft, Mazda and many other spots. The album includes the songs \"Kangaroo Court\" and \"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\". Outkast's André 3000, vocalist Shemika Secrest and NPR's Frank Tavares are featured on the song \"Farrah Fawcett Hair\". The album is produced and mixed entirely by the pair of Merchant and Simonian. The artwork is by Brazilian artist João Lauro Fonte.\n\nThe band embarked on its first-ever North American outing, the \"Dancing with Strangers\" tour, with special guests Gold Fields, which kicked off on April 23, 2013, at the Crescent Ballroom in Phoenix, Arizona. Capital Cities' May 9 show at New York City's Irving Plaza sold out two months in advance as well two nights at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. All proceeds from the June 7 show at the El Rey went to MusiCares and a Place Called Home. The band has also appeared and performed at Sundance, SXSW, SweetLife, and ULTRA.\nThe band premiered the official video of \"Safe and Sound\" on April 25, 2013 on Vevo. The clip was directed by Grady Hall (who also has worked with Beck and Modest Mouse). In the video, the song fuels a mash-up of the past 100 years of dance, presided over by the band at the newly restored Los Angeles Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The video featured work from Emmy-nominated choreographer Mandy Moore. The video was nominated for two 2013 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects. The video won a 2013 MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects.\nIn May 2013, \"Safe and Sound\" reached number one on the German Singles Chart.\nSeptember 5, 2013 marked the premiere of the \"Kangaroo Court\" music video. The video features appearances from Darren Criss, Shannon Woodward, and Channing Holmes. The story tells of a zebra (Merchant) who has been forbidden from a club, The Kangaroo Court. Attempting entry disguised as a horse, he falls for a lapdog (Woodward). Her date that night, a bulldog (Criss), becomes jealous and reveals the zebra for who he actually is. The zebra is placed under arrest for his crime and sent to court to face a kangaroo judge (Holmes). He is found guilty immediately and is executed by lion (Simonian).\nThe band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.\nCapital Cities joined Katy Perry on the North American leg of her Prismatic World Tour.\nIn April and May 2016, nearly three years after the release of the band's debut album, the official Capital Cities Facebook page made two posts strongly suggesting that new music was in the works. Two years later, the band released four singles within the span of four weeks and followed up with the release of Solarize on August 10, 2018 as their latest album to date.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nExtended plays\nSingles\nNotes\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 2:\nCapital Cities/ABC Inc.\nCapital Cities/ABC Inc. was an American media company. It was founded in 1985 when Capital Cities Communications purchased the much larger American Broadcasting Company. It was eventually acquired by The Walt Disney Company and re-branded itself as Disney–ABC Television Group (now Disney General Entertainment Content) in 1996.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nCapital Cities/ABC Inc. origins trace back in 1946, when Hyman Rosenblum (1911–1996), a local Albany businessman, and several investors, including future Congressman Leo William O'Brien and local advertising executive Harry L. Goldman decided to bid for a new radio station license in Albany. Rosenblum was also instrumental in help co-founding Hudson Valley Community College in Troy several years later, when he was on the Board of Trustees from 1953 to 1957 and then became the board's secretary in 1957, holding that position until his death in 1996. The company was incorporated as Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company on April 5, 1946.  when the company received the license for WROW radio in Albany, New York. In October 1953, it opened the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area's second television station, WROW-TV on channel 41. In the late fall of 1954, a group of New York City-based investors, led by famous radio broadcaster and author Lowell Thomas, boughtvisible and lasting effects of the Carrothers Commission was to choose a new capital city for the territorial government.The Carrothers Commission, for the first time, gave some voice to residents in the Northwest Territories through extensive consultations with the territorial population.  In prior years, the decision to change the seat of government had always been made without consulting Northwest Territories residents. Edgar Dewdney, for example, who made the decision to change the capital from Battleford to Regina, faced controversy because he owned property in Regina. After the territorial government moved to Ottawa, the government was often resented for being so far away.The Carrothers Commission spent two years visiting nearly every community in the territory and consulting with residents, community leaders, business people, and territorial politicians. The Carrothers Commission investigated and considered five communities for the capital: Hay River, Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Inuvik and Yellowknife.\nMany people in the Northwest Territories believed that Fort Smith would win since it already housed the Territories' civil service.\n\nYellowknife (1967–present)\nYellowknife officially became the capital on September 18, 1967, after the Carrothers commission chose it for its central location, transportation links, industrial base and residents' preferences.Yellowknife, in 1967, was not yet ready to serve as home for the government. During the years that it took for the capital's infrastructure to slowly develop, most of the civil service remained in Fort Smith for many years and the governing Council continued its practice of holding legislative sessions all over the territory for a number of years.The Northwest Territories marked a new era when the legislative council moved into a newly constructed legislature building on November 17, 1993. The new legislature was the first building built specifically for the Northwest Territories government since the government sat in Regina 88 years earlier. The legislature building was constructed to feature themes derived from the Inuit culture, which signaled that the government was sensitive to the ethnicity of the resident population.The modern day territorial government has matured in Yellowknife to become effective and responsible. The government in Yellowknife had largely gained back its powers on par with the pre-1905 government that was dissolved during creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The civil service has been effectively consolidated into the city of Yellowknife; and has gained control over administering its own elections from Elections Canada. Education is now under the jurisdiction of the territorial government and the territory has most powers afforded to the rest of the provinces. There has even talk by the Federal government of the territories gaining provincial status in the future.\n\nLessons learned for Nunavut capital (1995 vote)\nAs chronicled above, all seven capitals throughout the history of the Northwest Territories were chosen by some form of external government decision, though the Carrothers Commission did consult with the territorial population to guide its decision.\nAfter the selection of Yellowknife as the capital in 1967, many residents in the eastern Arctic continued to feel unrepresented by the territorial government, and many movements and groups were formed to remedy the situation.  Lessons had been learned from the historical changes in the Northwest Territories' seat of power, resulting in a number of territorial democratic processes leading to the creation of the new territory of Nunavut in 1999, formed from the eastern half of the Northwest Territories.\nIn 1976, as part of the land claims negotiations between the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami population and the Government of Canada, the parties discussed division of the Northwest Territories to provide a separate territory for the Inuit. In 1982, a plebiscite on division was held throughout the Northwest Territories, in which a majority of the residents voted in favour of division.The land claims agreement was completed in September 1992 and ratified by a majority of voters. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act and the Nunavut Act were passed by the Canadian Parliament.\nIn December, 1995, the Nunavut capital plebiscite was held, and the voters in the future Nunavut territory chose Iqaluit as their capital city, defeating Rankin Inlet. Iqaluit became the official capital on April 1, 1999, when Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories.\n\nSee also\nCommissioners of the Northwest Territories\nList of Northwest Territories general elections\nList of premiers of the Northwest Territories\nList of Northwest Territories Legislative Assemblies\nPassage 9:\nTweaker (band)\nTweaker is an American alternative rock collaboration project band founded by Chris Vrenna in the late 1990s. Tweaker's musical style incorporates synthpop, progressive rock, modern jazz and electronica genres, and is characterized by a generally melancholy and somber sound with matching artwork.\n\nHistory\nThe album The Attraction to All Things Uncertain was Vrenna's \"solo\" debut and it was not until the follow-up album, 2 a.m. Wakeup Call, that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band. While Vrenna and Walsh supply most instruments and electronics, many other musicians contributed to Tweaker's performances and recordings, including Robert Smith, David Sylvian, Burton C. Bell, Craig Wedren, Will Oldham, Hamilton Leithauser, Buzz Osborne, Jonathan Bates and Johnny Marr. The subsequent albums followed a preset central theme.\nTweaker wrote and performed the theme music to Doom 3, of which the theme song was released via the band's website. The rest of the soundtrack is accessible from the game's files. Tweaker also composed the theme music for the animated television show Xiaolin Showdown. Unlike the band's usual synthpop, shoegaze, modern jazz, Dark Ambient and industrial sound, the Doom 3 theme was mainly heavy metal.\nIn 2004, Tweaker opened for Skinny Puppy on select dates with a full live band, consisting of Chris Vrenna (drums, percussion and keyboard), Clint Walsh (guitar and keyboard), William Faith (bass guitar) and Nick Young (vocals). They performed everything live (i.e., no pre-recorded tape), although they did have to alter some of their songs to fit the live format — the most extreme case being a completely revamped rock version of \"Microsize Boy\".  The final performance on the tour was at QuakeCon 2005 in Dallas, TX.\n\nOfficial members\nChris Vrenna\nClint Walsh\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nThe Attraction to All Things Uncertain (September 18, 2001)\n2 a.m. Wakeup Call (April 20, 2004)\nCall the Time Eternity (October 23, 2012)\n\nRemix albums\nAnd Then There's Nothing (November 26, 2013)\n\nEPs\nLinoleum (August 21, 2001)\n\nSingles\nLinoleum (2001)\nXiaolin Showdown (2003)\nThe Steel Box (2019)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRed Branch (novel)\nRed Branch (ISBN 080410591X, 1989), by the Irish-American author Morgan Llywelyn, is a novel about the life of the Irish hero Cú Chulainn.  Red Branch novelizes several stories from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, including the well-known Táin Bó Cúailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) and Deirdre (of the Sorrows).\nPassage 2:\nRobert Jordan\nJames Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 – September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is known best for his series  The Wheel of Time (finished by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death) which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. He is one of several writers to have written original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered by fans to be some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts. Jordan also published historical fiction using the pseudonym Reagan O'Neal, a western as Jackson O'Reilly, and dance criticism as Chang Lung. Jordan claimed to have ghostwritten an \"international thriller\" that is still believed to have been written by someone else.\n\nEarly life\nJordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He went to Clemson University after high school, but dropped out after one year and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with \"V\" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm.After returning from Vietnam in 1970, Jordan studied physics at The Citadel. He graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree and began working for the U.S. Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977.\n\nPersonal life\nRobert Jordan was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe-collecting. He described himself as a \"High church\" Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. Politically, he described himself as a \"libertarian monarchist\". He lived with his wife, Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan's editor) in a house built in 1797. He listed John D. MacDonald, Jane Austen, Louis L'Amour, Charles Dickens, Robert A. Heinlein, Mark Twain and Montaigne as his favorite authors.\n\nIllness and death\nOn March 23, 2006, Jordan disclosed that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and that, with treatment, his median life expectancy was four years. In a separate weblog post, he encouraged his fans not to worry about him and stated that he intended to have a long and creative life.He began chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic during early April 2006. He participated in a study of the drug Revlimid, which had been approved recently for multiple myeloma but not yet tested for primary amyloidosis.Jordan died on September 16, 2007, from complications stemming from Multiple Myeloma. His funeral service was on September 19, 2007. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.Jordan's papers can be found in the special collections of the College of Charleston.\n\nSelected works\nThe Wheel of Time\nJordan published 11 books of 14 in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series. Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments written solely by Jordan owing to the expansion of the scale of the series as a whole. Because of his health problems, Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment A Memory of Light (later split into three volumes beginning with The Gathering Storm), but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death, and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died. He maintained that in doing so the book would get published even if \"the worst actually happens\". On December 7, 2007, Tor Books announced that Brandon Sanderson had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series. Harriet McDougal, Jordan's widow, chose him after reading Mistborn: The Final Empire.\nAll paperback (PB) page totals given are for the most widely available mass-market paperback editions. The page count for the hardback (HB) editions does not include glossary or appendix page counts.\nThe World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time is an encyclopedia for the series about the unnamed world where the plot takes place, which is often referred to by fans of the series as the World of the Wheel. It is published in the United States by Tor Books and in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books. The bulk of the text was written by Teresa Patterson based on notes and information provided by Jordan, who also served as the overall editor on the project. While the information in the guide is broadly canonical, the book is deliberately written with vague, biased, or even downright false (or guessed) information in places, as Patterson felt this would reflect a key theme of the series (the mutability of knowledge across time and distance).\n\nConan the Barbarian\nJordan was one of several writers who has written Conan the Barbarian stories. When Tom Doherty obtained the rights, he needed a novel very quickly, so Jordan's wife Harriet McDougal recommended him because she knew he had written his first novel, Warriors of the Altaii, in thirteen days.\n\nSo he thought I could write something fast, and he was right, and I liked it. It was fun writing something completely over the top, full of purple prose, and in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and the novelization of the second Conan movie. I've decided that those things were very good discipline for me. I had to work with a character and a world that had already been created and yet find a way to say something new about the character and the world. That was a very good exercise.\nConan the Invincible (1982)\nConan the Defender (1982)\nConan the Unconquered (1983)\nConan the Triumphant (1983)\nConan the Magnificent (1984)\nConan the Destroyer (1984) (adaptation of the movie of the same title)\nConan the Victorious (1984)They were packed into two separate volumes par Conan the Destroyer:\n\nThe Conan Chronicles\nThe Further Chronicles of Conan (The Conan Chronicles II in the UK, different contents)Jordan also compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.\nPassage 3:\nLion of Ireland\nLion of Ireland, by the American-Irish author Morgan Llywelyn, is a novel about the lifeoife, The O'Brien Press, ISBN 9780862782740\n1996 Silverlight (Arcana, Book 2; with Michael Scott)\n1996 Pride of Lions\n1998 1916, A Novel Of the Irish Rebellion, Forge Books, ISBN 9780765386144 \n1999 The Essential Library for Irish Americans\n2000 Etruscans (with Michael Scott), Tor Books, ISBN 9780312875510\n2000 A Pocket History of Irish Rebels\n2000 The Earth Is Made Of Stardust, Borgo Press, ISBN 9781587151590\n2001 1921, The War for Independence, Forge Books, ISBN 9780765326935 \n2001 Granuaile, The Pirate Queen (republished as Pirate Queen in 2006), The O'Brien Press, ISBN 9780862789749\n2003 1949, The Irish Republic, Forge Books, ISBN 9780765381347\n2005 1972, A Novel of Ireland's Unfinished Revolution, Forge Books, ISBN 9780765381330\n2006 The Greener Shore: A Novel of the Druids of Hibernia, Del Rey, ISBN 9780345477675, 0345477677\n2006 The Young Rebels, The O'Brien Press, ISBN 9780862785796\n2006 The History of Irish Rebels\n2006 The Vikings in Ireland\n2008 1999 - A Novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace, Forge Books, ISBN 9781429927062\n2010 Brendan - The Remarkable Life and Voyage of Brendan of Clonfert, Forge Books, ISBN 9780312860998\n2012 Cave of Secrets, The O'Brien Press, ISBN 9781847172075\n2013 After Rome, Forge Books, ISBN 9781429987400 \n2014 1014: Brian Boru & the Battle for Ireland, Dover Publications, ISBN 9780486842004\n2016 Only the Stones Survive, Forge Books, ISBN 9780765337931 \n2018 Drop by Drop, Tor Books, ISBN 9781250245311 \n2019 Step by Step\n2020 Inch by Inch, Tor Books, ISBN 9781250245328 \n2021 Breath by Breath, Tor Books, ISBN 9780765388728\n\nAwards\nPassage 7:\nGrania: She-King of the Irish Seas\nGrania: She-King of the Irish Seas is a 1986 historical fiction novel about Grace O'Malley (Irish: Gráinne Ní Mháille), the so-called \"Sea Queen of Connemara\", by American-born Irish author Morgan Llywelyn.

A group of Phoenician traders unexpectedly arrives and gives hope to the tribe.\nThe story follows Amergin, druid and chief bard of the Galicians, and his brothers; Éremón, Colptha, Éber Finn, Donn, and Ír - all sons of Milesios. After years of declining prosperity, the Gaelicians hope that the Phoenician traders, led by Age-Nor, will help bring them back. Unfortunately, neither side has anything of much worth to trade.\nAt a reception in the Heroes' Hall, Age-Nor is attacked by Ír, while Milesios is asleep and unaware. Amergin uses his bardic talent to entrance Ír, thus saving Age-Nor.\nLater in the novel, Age-Nor rewards Amergin, despite the bard's vehement protests, by giving him a servant, a shipwright named Sakkar, and regaling him with a tale of a fabled land to the north, Ierne. After a series of mishaps and bad decisions, it is eventually decided that a group of the Gaelicians, led by the Sons of the Mil, will settle this land.\nThe tribe builds a series of ships with the help of Sakkar, and set sail.\nWhen they arrive on Ierne, they are confronted by the mysterious Tuatha Dé Danann, People of the Goddess Danu. After a battle, the Dananns vanish with no trace, leaving Ierne for the Milesians after Éiru (A Goddess of the Tuatha De Dannan) hands over Ireland to Amergin for it was foretold.\n\nExternal links\nMorgan Llywelyn\nPassage 10:\nFinn Mac Cool (novel)\nFinn Mac Cool is a 1994 novel by the Irish-American author Morgan Llywelyn.

He also won the London Riders' Championship 1953 and 1954 and was a nine time South Australian Champion between 1948 and 1964.By winning the 1951 and 1952 World Championships, Young became the first Australian to win two World Championships in any form of motorsport.\n\nCareer\nAustralia\nJack Young started racing bikes with younger brother Frank on the Sand Pits at Findon in Adelaide, before starting his speedway career at the Kilburn Speedway on 9 May 1947 riding a 1926 Harley-Davidson Peashooter borrowed from his brother. There he rode alongside older brother Wally \"Joey\" Young (b. 1916 – d. 1990), and younger brother Frank. Jack and Frank both represented Australia in test matches against England. Quickly proving himself to be one of the best riders in Adelaide, Jack placed an impressive second in the SA title in 1947 (after only having raced at a couple of meetings), and would win his first South Australian Championship in 1948. He would go on to win the SA Championship again in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1963 and 1964, all at Rowley Park Speedway. Young would win the Queensland State Championship in 1953 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, and the Victorian State Championship in 1957 at the Tracey's Speedway in Melbourne.\nDespite his two World Championships, nine South Australian Championships and the Queensland and Victorian titles, Jack Young would never win or even place in the Australian Individual Speedway Championship, which during his time were held almost exclusively in New South Wales (at the Sydney Showground or Sydney Sports Ground), or in Queensland at the Exhibition Ground. Young declined several invitations to ride in the Australian championship, often preferring to take a break from speedway to enjoy the Australian summer and go fishing. He did finish third in an unofficial \"Australian Championship\" staged at the Harringay Stadium in London, England in 1950. The promoters of the speedway had a clearing in their schedule and decided fill the space by inviting the top Australian riders in the British Leagues at the time to ride in an Australian Championship (the field included Aussie born New Zealander Ronnie Moore). Brisbane rider Graham Warren won the meeting from NSW rider Aub Lawson and Young.\nJack Young announced his retirement from Speedway in December 1963 on the night he won his ninth and last SA Championship (counted as the 1963/64 Championship). Young and the rider who would succeed him as South Australia's best rider John Boulger, jointly hold the record for SA title wins with nine each.\nA lover of fishing, at his home in Adelaide Young was known to use his two World Championship trophies as a place to store his sinkers.\nJust a year after his death, Jack Young was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame for his services to speedway.In 2008, Young was posthumously inducted into the Australian Speedway Hall of Fame.\nIn November 2014, Jack Young was inducted into the Motorcycling South Australia Hall of Fame.\n\nInternational\nAfter winning his first South Australian championship in 1948 at Kilburn, as well as impressive displays for Australia in home Test's against England, Jack Young had the attention of British promoters. He was signed by the Edinburgh Monarchs in 1949 after they paid his fare to come over for a trial. He scored maximum points on his debut, winning all six of his rides.\nIn 1949, 1950 and 1951, Young won the Scottish Riders Championship (now the Scottish Open) at Old Meadowbank in Edinburgh.\nIn 1951, Jack Young made history by becoming the first second division rider to become World Champion when he won the title at the Wembley Stadium in London. He defeated England's Split Waterman and fellow Australian Jack Biggs in a three way run-off for the title after each had finished the meeting on 12 points.In 1952 Young moved up a division by joining the West Ham Hammers for a then record transfer fee of UK£3,750. He also retained his World title in front of 93,000 fans at Wembley, thus becoming the first dual World Champion and the first rider to win the title two years in succession.\nHe stayed with the Hammers until the end of the 1955 season and is remembered by many West Ham riders and fans alike as the best rider to ever race for the team. Young stayed home in Adelaide for the next two seasons riding mainly at his home track of Rowley Park, but in 1958 he returned to the UK to ride for the Coventry Bees. After again returning home to Adelaide in 1959, he again rode for the Bees in 1960 and 1961.\nJack Young's last World Final appearance was as a reserve rider for the 1961 Championship at the Malmö Stadion in Malmö, Sweden (the first World Championship Final not held at Wembley).

The forerunner to the World Championship was generally regarded to be the Star Riders' Championship. The final was held at London's Wembley Stadium in front of 74,000. It was the first of a record 26 times that Wembley would host the World Final with the last being in 1981.\n\nSummary\nThe World Championship would consist of a semi final round, where points would be added to the final to determine the winner. One of the favourites Jack Parker had a broken hand injury and was unable to compete in the final. Joe Abbott was also unable to line up for the final due to injury, despite qualifying for the final. They were replaced by Norman Parker and Bill Pitcher.Despite being unbeaten in the Final, Australian Bluey Wilkinson only finished third as the Championship was decided by bonus points accumulated in previous rounds plus the score from the final. Van Praag defeated England's Eric Langton in a runoff to be declared the inaugural Speedway World Champion.As they lined up at the tapes for the runoff, Langton broke them which would ordinarily lead to disqualification. However, Van Praag stated he did not want to win the title by default and insisted that a race should take place. At the restart Langton made it to the first bend in front and led until the final bend on the last lap when Van Praag darted through the smallest of gaps to win by less than wheel length.Afterwards, controversial allegations were abound that the two riders had 'fixed' the match race, deciding between them that the first person to the first bend would win the race and the Championship and split the prize money; Langton led into the first bend but was overtaken by Van Praag. Van Praag reportedly paid Langton £50 \"conscience money\" after the race for going back on the agreement.\n\nQualifying\nThe top 16 riders over 7 rounds would qualify for the World final. Ron Johnson and Bill Pitcher qualified as first reserves.\n\nPodium\nLionel Van Praag (Australia)\n  Eric Langton (Great Britain)\n  Bluey Wilkinson (Australia)\n\nWorld final\n10 September 1936\n London, Wembley Stadium\nPassage 10:\n2010 Individual Speedway Polish Championship\nThe 2010 Individual Speedway Polish Championship (Polish: Indywidualne Mistrzostwa Polski, IMP) was the 2010 version of Individual Speedway Polish Championship organized by the Polish Motor Union (PZM). The Championship was won by Janusz Kołodziej, who beat Krzysztof Kasprzak in the Run-off. Third was Rafał Dobrucki. Kołodziej, who won 2009 (host in 2010), 2010 Golden Helmet and 2010 Speedway World Cup was award nomination to the 2011 Speedway Grand Prix.

He is a two-time Grey Cup champion, having won in 2004 with the Toronto Argonauts and in 2011 with the Lions. He has played 10 seasons in the CFL with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and BC Lions. During the 2011 season, he became the 14th CFL receiver to record over 10,000 yards receiving in a career.\n\nHigh school career\nBruce attended Olathe North High School in Olathe, Kansas, and was a letterman in football. As a senior, he was a BlueChip Illustrated Top-100 pick, the Kansas State Player of the Year, and finished the year with 1,696 rushing yards.  Bruce finished his high school career with more than 3,000 rushing yards and 50 touchdowns.\n\nJunior college career\nBruce then attended Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas. As a freshman, he was named a First-team All-American selection and rushed for over 1,000 yards. During his sophomore season, he ran for 997 yards and 10 touchdowns and was named a Second-team All-American selection.\n\nNCAA Division I-A career\nBruce played college football for the University of Minnesota.  As a senior, he helped lead his team to an 8–3 record and a Sun Bowl berth.\n\nProfessional career\nKansas City Chiefs\nOn April 19, 2000, Bruce was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs only to be cut by the team later on.\n\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers\nOn May 1, 2001, Bruce joined the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers where he got his first opportunity as a professional to receive significant playing time, playing in all 18 regular season games.  In his rookie season, Bruce had 818 receiving yards with 7 touchdowns.  His team went on to play in the Grey Cup championship, only to lose to the Calgary Stampeders.\nIn 2002, Bruce surpassed the 1000 yard receiving mark by amassing 1062 receiving yards with 12 touchdowns in 17 games.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nIn 2003, Bruce returned to the U.S. to try his luck once more with the NFL.  On March 3 of that year, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers where he spent much of his playing time on special teams.\n\nToronto Argonauts\nIn 2004, after being released by the 49ers following their training camp, Bruce returned to the CFL with the Toronto Argonauts, signing with them on September 3, more than halfway through the CFL season and just shortly before their Labour Day Classic game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in which he played.  For the remaining seven games in the regular season, Bruce had 247 receiving yards with just one touchdown.  In addition to playing receiver, Bruce also served as one of two kick returners on the team alongside incumbent Bashir Levingston.  In that role, Bruce returned two kick returns for touchdowns that season.  In the East Division final, Bruce led all receivers with 12 receptions for 101 yards, and returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, helping the Argonauts advance to the Grey Cup championship that year.  In the big game, the kick returning threat of both Bruce & Levingston induced the opposing BC Lions to punt the ball out of bounds for much of the game to neutralize the threat.  In addition, Bruce was once again a go to receiver amassing 79 yards on 5 receptions.  Bruce and the Argos went on to win the Grey Cup.\n\nIn 2005, Bruce established himself as the Argonauts top receiver with 1205 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns.  In that same year, Bruce was named an East division all-star marking the first time in his CFL career he had ever been named to an all-star team.\nIn 2008, after acquiring a touchdown against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Bruce was fined an undisclosed amount by the CFL for donning a Spider-Man mask during his touchdown celebration.In 2009, he received two objectionable conduct penalties and an undisclosed fine from the CFL for a touchdown celebration against the Tiger-Cats on July 1, in which he removed his helmet, jersey, and shoulder pads, and laid down in the end zone in what he said was a tribute to the recently deceased pop star, Michael Jackson. The Argonauts publicly supported the fine and disciplined Bruce additionally and he apologized to teammates at a team meeting the following day. Head coach Bart Andrus took some responsibility on himself, however, noting that, \"I made the mistake of telling him in camp that once he got to the end zone I didn't care what he did but he's straight with it now and I think next time around he will celebrate in an appropriate manner.\"\n\nHamilton Tiger-Cats\nOn July 29, 2009season for a total of 12 passes for 94 yards and one lost fumble.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCeltic studies\nCeltic studies or Celtology is the academic discipline occupied with the study of any sort of cultural output relating to the Celtic-speaking peoples (i.e. speakers of Celtic languages). This ranges from linguistics, literature and art history, archaeology and history, the focus lying on the study of the various Celtic languages, living and extinct. The primary areas of focus are the six Celtic languages currently in use: Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.\nAs a university subject, it is taught at a number of universities, most of them in Ireland, the United Kingdom, or France, but also in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands.\n\nHistory\nWritten studies of the Celts, their cultures, and their languages go back to classical Greek and Latin accounts, possibly beginning with Hecataeus in the 6th century BC and best known through such authors as Polybius, Posidonius, Pausanias, Diodorus Siculus, Julius Caesar and Strabo. Modern Celtic studies originated in the 16th and 17th centuries, when many of these classical authors were rediscovered, published and translated.Academic interest in Celtic languages grew out of comparative and historical linguistics, which was itself established at the end of the 18th century. In the 16th century, George Buchanan studied the Goidelic languages. The first major breakthrough in Celtic linguistics came with the publication of Archaeologia Britannica (1707) by the Welsh scholar Edward Lhuyd, who was the first to recognise that Gaulish, British and Irish belong to the same language family. He also published an English version of a study by Paul-Yves Pezron of Gaulish.\nIn 1767 James Parsons published his study The Remains of Japhet, being historical enquiries into the affinity and origins of the European languages. He compared a 1000-word lexicon of Irish and Welsh and concluded that they were originally the same, then comparing the numerals in many other languages.\nThe second big leap forwards was made when the Englishman Sir William Jones postulated that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and many other languages including \"the Celtic\" derived from a common ancestral language. This hypothesis, published in The Sanscrit Language (1786), would later be hailed as the discovery of the Indo-European language family, from which grew the field of Indo-European studies. The Celtic languages were definitively linked to the Indo-European family over the course of the 19th century.\nAlthough Jones' trail-blazing hypothesis inspired numerous linguistic studies, of which Celtic languages were a part, it was not until Johann Kaspar Zeuss's monumental Grammatica Celtica (volume 1, 1851; volume 2, 1853) that any truly significant progress was made. Written in Latin, the work draws on the earliest Old Irish, Middle Welsh and other Celtic primary sources to construct a comparative grammar, which was the first to lay out a firm basis for Celtic linguistics. Among other achievements, Zeuss was able to crack the Old Irish verb.\n\nCeltic studies in the German-speaking world and the Netherlands\nGerman Celtic studies (Keltologie) is seen by many as having been established by Johann Kaspar Zeuss (1806–1856) (see above). In 1847, he was appointed professor of linguistics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Until the middle of the 19th century, Celtic studies progressed largely as a subfield of linguistics. Franz Bopp (1791–1867) carried out further studies in comparative linguistics to link the Celtic languages to the Proto-Indo-European language. He is credited with having finally proven Celtic to be a branch of the Indo-European language family. From 1821 to 1864, he served as a professor of oriental literature and general linguistics in Berlin.In 1896, Kuno Meyer and Ludwig Christian Stern founded the Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie (ZCP), the first academic journal solely devoted to aspects of Celtic languages and literature, and still in existence today. In the second half of the century, significant contributions were made by the Orientalist Ernst Windisch (1844–1918). He held a chair in Sanskrit at the University of Leipzig; but he is best remembered for his numerous publications in the field of Celtic studies. In 1901, the Orientalist and Celtologist Heinrich Zimmer (1851–1910) was made professor of Celtic languages at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, the first position of its kind in Germany. He was followed in 1911 by Kuno Meyer (1858–1919), who, in addition to numerous publications in the field, was active in the Irish independence movement.Perhaps the most important German-speaking Celticist is the Swiss scholar Rudolf Thurneysen (1857–1940). A student of Windisch and Zimmer, Thurneysen was appointed to the chair of comparative linguistics at the University of Freiburg in 1887; he succeeded to the equivalent chair at the University of Bonn in 1913. His notability arises from his work on Old Irish. For his masterwork, Handbuch des Altirischen (\"Handbook of Old Irish\", 1909), translated into English as A Grammar of Old Irish, he located and analysed a multitude of Old Irish manuscripts. His work is considered as the basis for all succeeding studies of Old Irish.In 1920, Julius Pokorny (1887–1970) was appointed to the chair of Celtic languages at Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin. Despite his support for German nationalism and Catholic faith, he was forced out of his position by the Nazis on account of his Jewish ancestry. He subsequently emigrated to Switzerland but returned to Germany in 1955 to teach at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. In Berlin, he was succeeded in 1937 by Ludwig Mühlhausen, a devout Nazi.After World War II, German Celtic studies took place predominantly in West Germany and Austria. Studies in the field continued at Freiburg, Bonn, Marburg, Hamburg as well as Innsbruck; however an independent professorship in Celtic studies has not been instituted anywhere. In this period, Hans Hartmann, Heinrich Wagner and Wolfgang Meid made notable contributions to the scientific understanding of the boundaries of the Celtic language area and the location of the homeland of the Celtic peoples. The Berlin chair in Celtic languages has not been occupied since 1966.Today, Celtic studies is only taught at a handful of German universities, including those of Bonn, Trier, and Mannheim, the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, and the Philipps University of Marburg. It is also taught at the University of Vienna. Only Marburg, Vienna and Bonn maintain formal programs of study, but even then usually as a subsection of comparative or general linguistics. Only Marburg offers an M.A. course specifically in Celtic Studies. No Celtic studies research has taken place in the former centres of Freiburg, Hamburg or Berlin sinceJordan Raskin and Sandu Florea.

Continental Celtic is a geographic, rather than linguistic, grouping of the ancient Celtic languages.\nThese languages were spoken by the people known to Roman and Greek writers as the Keltoi, Celtae, Galli, and Galatae. They were spoken in an area arcing from the northern half of Iberia in the west to north of Belgium, and east to the Carpathian basin and the Balkans as Noric, and in inner Anatolia (modern day Turkey) as Galatian.\nEven though Breton has been spoken in Continental Europe since at least the 6th century AD, it is not considered one of the Continental Celtic languages, as it is a Brittonic language, like Cornish and Welsh. A Gaulish substratum in Breton has been suggested, but that is debated.\n\nAttested languages\nIt is likely that Celts spoke dozens of different languages and dialects across Europe in pre-Roman times, but only a small number are attested:\n\nLepontic (6th to 4th century BC) was spoken on the southern side of the Alps. It is evidenced in a number of inscriptions as well as place names.\nGaulish (3rd century BC to 5th (?) century AD) was the main language spoken in greater Gaul. This is often considered to be divided into two dialects, Cisalpine (spoken in what is now Italy) and Transalpine (spoken in what is now France). It is evidenced in a number of inscriptions as well as place names and tribal names in writings of classical authors. It may have been a substratum to Breton (see below).\nGalatian, which was spoken in the region of Ankara of what is now central Turkey. Classical writers say that the language is similar to that of Gaul. There is also evidence of invasion and settlement of the Ankara area by Celts from Europe.\nNoric, which is the name given sometimes to the Celtic spoken in Central and Eastern Europe. It was spoken in Austria and Slovenia; only two fragmentary texts are preserved.\nCeltiberian or Northeastern Hispano-Celtic (3rd to 1st century BC) is the name given to the language in northeast Iberia, between the headwaters of the Douro, Tagus, Júcar and Turía rivers and the Ebro river. It is attested in some 200 inscriptions as well as place names. It is distinct from Iberian.\nGallaecian also called Gallaic or Northwestern Hispano-Celtic, attested in a set (corpus) of Latin inscriptions containing isolated words and sentences that are unmistakably Celtic. It was spoken in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula comprising today's Spanish regions of Galicia, western Asturias and western Castile and León, and the Norte Region in northern Portugal.\n\nUse of term\nThe modern term Continental Celtic is used in contrast to Insular Celtic. While many researchers agree that Insular Celtic is a distinct branch of Celtic (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995) that has undergone common linguistic innovations, there is no evidence that the Continental Celtic languages can be similarly grouped. Instead, the group called Continental Celtic is paraphyletic, and the term refers simply to non-Insular Celtic languages. Since little material has been preserved in any of the Continental Celtic languages, historical linguistic analysis based on the comparative method is difficult to perform. However, other researchers see the Brittonic languages and Gaulish as forming part of a subgroup of the Celtic languages that is known as P-Celtic. Continental languages are P-Celtic except for Celtiberian, which is Q-Celtic. They have had a definite influence on all of the Romance languages.\n\nSee also\nItalo-Celtic\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSHV connector\nThe SHV (safe high voltage) connector is a type of RF connector used for terminating a coaxial cable. \nThe connector uses a bayonet mount similar to those of the BNC and MHV connectors, but is easily distinguished due to its very thick and protruding insulator. This insulation geometry makes SHV connectors safer for handling high voltage than MHV connectors, by preventing accidental contact with the live conductor in an unmated connector or plug. The connector is also designed such that when it is being disconnected from a plug, the high voltage contact is broken before the ground contact, to prevent accidental shocks. The connector is also designed to prevent users from forcing a high voltage connector into a low voltage plug or vice versa (as can happen with MHV and BNC connectors), by reversing the gender compared to BNC.\nDetails of the connector comprising dimensions of the mating parts, voltage rating, minimum insulation requirements and more are specified by the IEC document 60498.SHV connectors are used in laboratory settings for voltages and currents beyond the capacity of BNC and MHV connectors. Standard SHV connectors are rated for 5000 volts DC and 5 amperes, although higher-voltage versions (to 20 kV) are also available.\nPassage 2:\nU-229\nThe U-229 is a cable connector currently used by the U.S. military for audio connections to field radios, typically for connecting a handset. There are five-pin and six-pin versions, the sixth pin version using the extra pin to power accessories. This type of connector is also used by the National Security Agency to load cryptographic keys into encryption equipment from a fill device.\nIt is specified by the detail specification MIL-DTL-55116D .\n\nExternal links\nU-229 pin-outs and information\nMIL-DTL-55116 military specification\nCompilation of military radio related standards\nPassage 3:\nMulticable\nIn stage lighting, a multicable (otherwise known as multi-core cable or mult) is a type of heavy-duty electrical cable used in theaters to power lights. The basic construction involves a bundle of individual conductors surrounded by a single outer jacket. Whereas single cables only have three conductors, multicable has ten or more. They are configured to run in six or eight-circuit varieties. Typically, both ends of multicable have a specific connector known as a Socapex Connector. Technicians then combine the cables with break-outs and break-ins, which essentially are an octopus-like adapter with one Socapex end and six to eight Edison, twist-lok, or stage pin style connectors.\n\nUse\nMulticable is used when technicians need to mount lights where no permanent circuiting options exist. Typically, mounting pipes designed for lighting use have enclosed raceways with permanent power outlets, running to a remote dimmer unit somewhere in the theater. When such options are not available, technicians have to run cable to these positions instead. Originally, it had to be done with cable bundles, running single extension cords long distances and tying or taping them into groups, or just running cable in a disorganized mess.\nInstead, several circuits can be run in a single cable, using multicables. These are used most often in theaters without on-stage raceways or in systems with portable dimming racks, which are not wired into the building. Multicable is a quick, organized way of getting a large amount of circuits away from the dimmers to the lights.\n\nAdvantages\nViewed in comparison to six individual extension cords, multicable is a neater and more organized alternative. There are fewer connectors, and the multis are labeled one to six on their adapters so technicians always know which circuit they're working on.\n\nDisadvantages\nRunning multicable from source to light is particularly strenuous. Compared to running six cables one by one, multicable is much heavier. Also, because of the large amount of copper in the cable, they have very bad memory- an effect where cables will try to curl and twist in attempt to return to its original coiled state. This makes packing multicable back into coils also tricky.\nPassage 4:\nCamlock (electrical)\nA camlock or cam-lock is an interchangeable electrical connector, often used in temporary electrical power production and distribution, predominantly in North America. Originally a trade name as Cam-Lok, it is now a generic term.  Each camlock connector carries a single phase, pole, or conductor; multiple camlock connectors will be used to make a complete electrical supply or circuit.\nThe most common form is the 16 series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 °C terminations. Also in common use is the 15 series (mini-cam), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the 17 series with ratings up to 760 A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist—the latter is the most common. The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body; later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area.  The tail of the connector insulator body is trimmable to fit the cable outer diameter.\nAnother version is the Posi-Lok, which features keyed, shrouded connectors, and panels with sequencing interlocks.Camlock is generally used where temporary connections of 3-phase and/or more than 50 A are needed.  Applications include connecting large temporary generators or load banks to distribution panels or building disconnects.  Common scenarios include testing, emergencies, temporary special events, and traveling stage shows with large lighting and sound equipment.  They are usually found only in professional environments, where connections are performed by qualified personnel.\n\nColor codes\nStandards and industry conventions for phase and voltage exist, but may vary in practice, particularly when international companies and traveling productions are involved.\n\nNorth America\nThe National Electric Code (NEC) only specifies colors for ground and neutral: Green for the equipment grounding (safety) conductor (NEC Article 250.119), and white or grey for the neutral (grounded) conductor (NEC Article 200.6).  These colors may not be used for any other purpose, nor may their purpose use a different color.  No other colors are specified by the NEC for general power distribution.\nNonetheless, the following conventions exist:\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe UK system has two established camlock colour codes.  The old and new colour codes are not compatible:  Black was originally used to indicate neutral, and is now a phase colour; blue was used to denote a phase, and is now used to denote neutral.  As the use of camlocks in the UK has been declining, it is very unlikely to find any matching the new colour codes.\n\nGallery\nCamlock power distribution\nPassage 5:\nCable gland\nA cable gland (more often known in the U.S. as a cord grip, cable strain relief, cable connector or cable fitting) is a device designed to attach and secure the end of an electrical cable to the equipment. A cable gland providescables and network cards. BNC connections can also be found in recording studios. Digital recording equipment uses the connection for synchronization of various components via the transmission of word clock timing signals.\nTypically the male connector is fitted to a cable, and the female to a panel on equipment. Cable connectors are often designed to be fitted by crimping using a special power or manual tool. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner dielectric to the correct lengths in one operation are used.\n\nOrigin\nThe connector was named the BNC (for Bayonet Neill–Concelman) after its bayonet mount locking mechanism and its inventors, Paul Neill and Carl Concelman. Neill worked at Bell Labs and also invented the N connector; Concelman worked at Amphenol and also invented the C connector.\n\nTypes and compatibility\nTypes\nBNC connectors are most commonly made in 50 and 75 ohm versions, matched for use with cables of the same characteristic impedance. The 75 ohm types can sometimes be recognized by the reduced or absent dielectric in the mating ends but this is by no means reliable. There was a proposal in the early 1970s for the dielectric material to be coloured red in 75 ohm connectors, and while this is occasionally implemented, it did not become standard. The 75 ohm connector is dimensionally slightly different from the 50 ohm variant, but the two nevertheless can be made to mate. The 50 ohm connectors are typically specified for use at frequencies up to 4 GHz and the 75 ohm version up to 2 GHz.\nVideo (particularly HD video signals) and DS3 Telco central office applications primarily use 75 ohm BNC connectors, whereas 50 ohm connectors are used for data and RF. Many VHF receivers used 75 ohm antenna inputs, so they often used 75 ohm BNC connectors.\nReverse-polarity BNC (RP-BNC) is a variation of the BNC specification which reverses the polarity of the interface. In a connector of this type, the female contact normally found in a jack is usually in the plug, while the male contact normally found in a plug is in the jack. This ensures that reverse polarity interface connectors do not mate with standard interface connectors. The SHV connector is a high-voltage BNC variant that uses this reverse polarity configuration.\nSmaller versions of the BNC connector, called Mini BNC and High Density BNC (HD BNC), are manufactured by Amphenol. While retaining the electrical characteristics of the original specification, they have smaller footprints giving a higher packing density on circuit boards and equipment backplanes. These connectors have true 75 ohm impedance making them suitable for HD video applications.\n\nCompatibility\nThe different versions are designed to mate with each other,\nand a 75 ohm and a 50 ohm BNC connector which both comply with the 2007 IEC standard, IEC 61169-8, will mate non-destructively. At least one manufacturer claims very high reliability for the connectors' compatibility.At frequencies below 10 MHz the impedance mismatch between a 50 ohm connector or cable and a 75 ohm one has negligible effects. BNC connectors were thus originally made only in 50 ohm versions, for use with any impedance of cable. Above this frequency, however, the mismatch becomes progressively more significant and can lead to signal reflections.\n\nBNC inserter/remover tool\nA BNC inserter/remover tool also called a BNC tool, BNC extraction tool, BNC wrench, or BNC apple corer, is used to insert or remove BNC connectors in high density or hard-to-reach locations, such as densely wired patch panels in broadcast facilities like central apparatus rooms.\nBNC tools are usually light weight, made of stainless steel, and have screw driver type plastic handle grips for applying torque. Their shafts are usually double the length of a standard connector.\nThey help to safely, efficiently and quickly connect and disconnect BNC connectors in jack fields. BNC tools facilitate access and minimize the risk of accidentally disconnecting nearby connectors.\n\nSimilar connectors\nSimilar connectors using the bayonet connection principle exist, and a threaded connector is also available. United States military standard MIL-PRF-39012 entitled Connectors, Coaxial, Radio Frequency, General Specification for (formerly MIL-C-39012) covers the general requirements and tests for radio frequency connectors used with flexible cables and certain other types of coaxial transmission lines in military, aerospace, and spaceflight applications.\n\nSR connectors\nIn the USSR, BNC connectors were copied as SR connectors. As a result of recalculating from imperial to metric measurements their dimensions differ slightly from those of BNC. They are however generally interchangeable with them, sometimes with force applied.\n\nTNC (Threaded Neill–Concelman)\nA threaded version of the BNC connector, known as the TNC connector (for Threaded Neill-Concelman) is also available. It has superior performance to the BNC connector at microwave frequencies.\n\nTwin BNC or twinax\nTwin BNC (also known as twinax) connectors use the same bayonet latching shell as an ordinary BNC connector but contain two independent contact points (one male and one female), allowing the connection of a 78 ohm or 95 ohm shielded differential pair such as RG-108A. They can operate up to 100 MHz and 100 volts. They cannot mate with ordinary BNC connectors. An abbreviation for twinax connectors has been BNO (Sühner).\n\nTriaxial\nTriaxial (also known as triax) connectors are a variant on BNC that carry a signal and guard as well as ground conductor. These are used in sensitive electronic measurement systems. Early triaxial connectors were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later triaxial connectors also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a BNC connector. Adaptors exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between triaxial and BNC connectors. The triaxial may also be known as a Trompeter connection.\n\nHigh-voltage connectors\nFor higher voltages (above 500 V), MHV and SHV connectors are typically used. MHV connectors are easily mistaken for BNC type, and can be made to mate with them by brute force. The SHV connector was developed as a safer alternative, it will not mate with ordinary BNC connectors and the inner conductor is much harder to accidentally contact.\n\nMiniature connectors\nBNC connectors are commonly used in electronics, but in some applications they are being replaced by LEMO 00 miniature connectors which allow for significantly higher densities. In video broadcast industry, the DIN 1.0/2.3 and the HD-BNC connector are used for higher density products\n\nSee also\nSMA connector\nSMB connector\nSMC connector\nUHF connector\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCass Corridor\nThe Cass Corridor is the name of the neighborhoods on the west end of Midtown Detroit. It includes the Cass Park Historic District, the Cass-Davenport Historic District and Old Chinatown. The corridor's main street, Cass Avenue, runs parallel with M-1 (Woodward Avenue), a main Detroit artery running north toward New Center. Though Cass runs from Congress Street, ending a few miles farther north at West Grand Boulevard, the Cass Corridor generally is defined as between Interstate 75 (I-75) at its southern end and Interstate 94 (I-94) to the north, and stretches from Woodward to the east and to the west: John C. Lodge (M-10 service drive) north of Temple, and Grand River Avenue south of Temple.\n\nHistory\nSignificant landmarks of the area include the Detroit Masonic Temple (the world's largest building of its kind), Cass Technical High School, and the Metropolitan Center for High Technology are all located along Cass. Little Caesars Arena, open since September 5, 2017, as the new home of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings and the NBA's Detroit Pistons, is on the west side of Woodward Avenue near I-75.\nIn the 1960s and '70s, the Cass Corridor became an area of cultural significance. Artists began renting cheap studio space in the Cass Corridor, which was near Detroit's Cultural Center Historic District. Artists associated with or influenced by the Cass Corridor artist movement include Brenda Goodman, Gary Grimshaw, Tyree Guyton, Charles McGee, Ann Mikolowski, Jim Pallas, Ellen Phelan, Gilda Snowden, Robert Wilbert, and Theo Wujcik.In the 1970s, the Cass Corridor was a poor neighborhood known for drugs, prostitution and sex crimes against children. The area was of significance in the Oakland County Child Killer case.Creem, which billed itself as \"America's Only Rock 'n' Roll Magazine,\" had its headquarters in the area. The student population contributes to the bohemian atmosphere in Cass Corridor. The artistic community has produced a number of significant artists, including Sixto Rodriguez, Negative Approach and The White Stripes, who played their first show at the Gold Dollar.\nCass Corridor is also the location of the annual Dally in the Alley arts festival.Since the 2000s, Joel Landy, president of the Cass Avenue Development construction company, has renovated and remodelled several buildings in the Cass Corridor. Landy was also featured in the television series American Pickers (season 3 episode \"Motor City\", September 19, 2011). Since 1997, Avalon International Breads has been located in the Cass Corridor. In 2015, Jack White of the White Stripes, opened a retail store for his Record Label, Third Man Records at the Corner of Canfield and Cass.From 2009, Dr. Alesia Montgomery of Michigan State University conducted a 5-year study visualizing a reinvented Detroit as a green city, with a particular emphasis on the Cass Corridor.\n\nSee also\nChinatown Detroit\nList of places named for Lewis Cass\nPassage 2:\nPossessed (roller coaster)\nPossessed is an Inverted Impulse launched roller coaster located at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Manufactured by Intamin and designed by Werner Stengel, the roller coaster originally debuted at Six Flags Ohio amusement park as Superman: Ultimate Escape on May 5, 2000. After Cedar Fair purchased the park and renamed it back to Geauga Lake in early 2004, the coaster was immediately renamed Steel Venom. The ride closed in 2006 and was moved to Dorney Park. It reopened in 2008 briefly under the name Voodoo, and was renamed Possessed for the 2009 season. The model is identical to five other impulse coaster installations at other amusement parks. A larger version called Wicked Twister was located at Cedar Point until its closure in September 2021.\n\nHistory\nGeauga Lake era (2000–2006)\nThe ride opened on May 5, 2000 at Six Flags Ohio as Superman: Ultimate Escape. It was based on the DC Comics character Superman. Following Cedar Fair's acquisition of the park in 2004, in which the original Geauga Lake name was reinstituted to the park, all Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding owned by Six Flags was removed. In the process, the coaster was renamed Steel Venom, while receiving a new logo with a black background featuring a silver and purple snake. Even though Cedar Fair removed any mentions of Superman from the ride, the original blue, red, and yellow color scheme remained intact.The coaster was dismantled after the 2006 season and put into storage. At the end of the 2007 season, Cedar Fair announced the amusement park section of the park would close and the park would operate exclusively as Wildwater Kingdom. Many rides at the park were relocated to other parks in the Cedar Fair chain.\n\nDorney Park era (2007–present)\nSteel Venom was relocated to Dorney Park, where it reopened as Voodoo several weeks into the 2008 season on May 17, 2008. Prior to opening at Dorney Park, it was repainted to its current color scheme, as shown in the picture above, the supports were repainted teal and the track was repainted yellow. In 2009, the name was changed to Possessed after Six Flags expressed concerns over the name Voodoo, which it had recently trademarked for another ride. Instead of challenging, Cedar Fair opted to appease Six Flags and rename the coaster. Cedar Fair turned the incident into a marketing opportunity, which focused on a story that the ride was overtaken by evil spirits, fitting in line with the ride's original theme.Possessed was closed for the entire 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It reopened in 2021.\n\nDesign\nThe coaster's layout consists of two vertical spikes, one twisted and the other straight vertical with a holding brake, connected by a launch and station tract to form a basic \"U\" layout. The original ride began with riders being launched forward by the use of linear induction motors. After the initial launch, the train heads up the twisted vertical spike that twists the train 180 degrees. The train then falls and is launched backwards up the vertical spike. It shuttles back and forth three times. During the ride's initial years, the holding brake at the top of the vertical rear spike would engage on the final launch, locking the train in place for a very brief moment. This holding brake is no longer operational. Valleyfair's Steel Venom is currently the only Intamin impulse coaster in the United States still operating with its holding brake.\nThe maximum G-force of the ride is 3.7 Gs, expectantly low forced the position on Chatterton Hill, and Washington organized his army for retreat into the hills.  With the arrival of additional Hessian and Waldeck troops under Lord Percy on October 30, Howe planned to act against the Americans the following day.  However, a heavy rain fell the whole next day, and when Howe was finally prepared to act, he awoke to find that Washington had again eluded his grasp.Washington withdrew his army into the hills to the north on the night of October 31, establishing a camp near North Castle.  Howe chose not to follow, instead attempting without success to draw Washington out.  On November 5, he turned his army south to finish evicting Continental Army troops from Manhattan, a task he accomplished with the November 16 Battle of Fort Washington.Washington eventually crossed the Hudson River at Peekskill with most of his army, leaving New England regiments behind to guard supply stores and important river crossings.  Later, British movements chased him across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, and the British established a chain of outposts across New Jersey. Washington, seeing an opportunity for a victory to boost the nation's morale,  crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall's troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton.\n\nLegacy\nEach year on or near the anniversary date, the White Plains Historical Society hosts a commemoration of the event at the Jacob Purdy House in White Plains, New York.  Two ships in the United States Navy were named for the Battle of White Plains. CVE-66 was an escort carrier in World War II. AFS-4 was a combat stores ship that was decommissioned in 1995.According to some historians, the Headless Horseman depicted in Washington Irving's short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" was inspired by a real-life Hessian soldier who lost his head by cannon fire during this battle.\n\nSee also\nList of American Revolutionary War battles\nAmerican Revolutionary War §British New York counter-offensive.

Designed by Werner Stengel, it was a second-generation, double-twisting Impulse model manufactured by Intamin. Wicked Twister opened as the tallest and fastest inverted coaster in the world on May 5, 2002. It was retired by the park on September 6, 2021, closed on September 7, and gave over 16 million rides during its lifetime.\n\nHistory\nConstruction on Wicked Twister began on October 15, 2001, shortly after Stadium Games, formerly known as the Aquarium, was razed. The new coaster was officially announced the following month, and its media day was held on May 2, 2002.Billed as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster ever built, Wicked Twister actually opened as the tallest and fastest inverted coaster in the world on May 5, 2002. It held both records until the opening of Legendary Twin Dragon at Chongqing Sunac Land in China in 2021. Additional supports were added to the ride's structure for the 2003 season. Two yellow supports were added to each spike to connect the track to the top of the main support structure.\n\nIn May 2021, park official Tony Clark implied in a series of tweets that Wicked Twister was going to be retired. This was confirmed on August 6, 2021, when Cedar Point officially announced the closure of Wicked Twister, scheduled for September 6, 2021. The ride then closed September 7, and on its last day of operation, park employees handed out \"last launch\" buttons to riders, sold limited-edition commemorative t-shirts, and gave away 16 \"golden tickets\" granting winners a spot on the last public train. Wicked Twister had accumulated over 16 million rides in 20 seasons of operation.On November 3, 2021, Cedar Point announced that Wicked Twister would be demolished. Demolition and removal was completed on February 8, 2022.\n\nRide details\nWicked Twister consisted of two 215 feet (66 m) tall spikes. Both ends of the track were designed with 450-degree vertical twists, referred to as the front and rear towers, which differentiated Wicked Twister from other Impulse Coaster models from Intamin. The loading platform and linear induction motor (LIM) propulsion system sat between the two towers along a horizontal track section. The ride was built directly on Cedar Point Beach, and its entrance plaza was located in the former Aquarium location. The track was painted yellow with teal supports.The ride featured one train that consisted of eight cars. Riders were arranged two across in two rows for a total of 32 riders. Wicked Twister's theme song was \"The Winner\" by the Crystal Method.\n\nLayout\nLinear induction motors propelled the train forward out of the station at 50 mph (80 km/h) during the first launch, which carried the train approximately halfway up the front tower. After coming to a stop, the train then fell and returned through the station, re-entering the LIM section and accelerating for a second launch to 63 mph (101 km/h) in the opposite direction. After climbing to its peak approximately halfway up the rear tower, the process would repeat a third time accelerating to 69 mph (111 km/h) and climbing to its highest point on the front tower.\nA fourth and final LIM launch on the train's return through the station accelerated the train to its maximum speed of 72 mph (116 km/h), reaching a maximum height of 206 ft (63 m) up the rear tower. The train then made one more final pass through the station without any interaction from the LIM launch section and up the front spike. Subsequent passes through the station were met with the brakes being applied to slow the train slightly more each time until finally coming to rest.\n\nSee also\nThe Flash: Vertical Velocity – similar coaster located at Six Flags Great America\nPossessed – similar coaster located at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom\nSteel Venom – similar coaster located at Valleyfair\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The series takes place during a pandemic, social unrest, economic crisis, racism and a polarized America.  Kate Warn and her team of lady operatives are behind the true origins of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, founded by fervent abolitionist Allan Pinkerton. Historical figures appear throughout the series, including Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, notably when the agency's most valued Ace Kate Warnprovement act of 2008.  This landmark legislation placed limits on the amount of lead that can be used in children's products.\nAlso that year, Gilbert testified before the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of consumers who were assessed fees for switching cell phone companies before their contracts expired. Her position was that such fees were unfair.  She urged the FCC not to preempt state laws and state-based lawsuits intended to protect consumers from these allegedly unfair practices by cell phone companies.Over the course of three years from 2007–2009, Gilbert organized a coalition of over a dozen labor and nonprofit organizations to support legislation that would provide a pathway for the approval of generic versions of costly medicines.  A version of this legislation was later incorporated in national health care reform policies.\nIn 2009, Gilbert worked with people injured by defects in Chrysler and General Motors vehicles to urge the Obama administration and the automobile companies to modify their bankruptcy agreements to ensure that personal injury victims would have an opportunity to receive compensation.  As a result, the agreements were modified to allow people injured in the future by vehicles manufactured before the bankruptcy to be compensated for their injuries.\n\n2010\nOn February 4, 2010, Gilbert participated in a webcast sponsored by OMB Watch on \"The Obama Administration and Public Protections.\"On behalf of the Committee to Support the Antitrust Laws, Gilbert worked with Congress and the Obama Administration to amend the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act to ensure that members of criminal antitrust conspiracies adequately cooperate with civil lawsuits in return for reduced damages.\nOn June 10, 2010, Pamela Gilbert was appointed to the board of directors of the AAI (American Antitrust Institute).\n\n2011–Present\nOn behalf of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety (CARS), Gilbert led the successful lobbying effort to pass a federal law prohibiting rental car companies from renting or selling recalled cars until they are repaired. Gilbert worked with Mrs. Cally Houck, whose two daughters were killed in a rental car that caught on fire and crashed as a result of an unrepaired defect that had been subject to a safety recall.  President Obama on December 4, 2015 signed into law the \"Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act\" (H.R. 2198, S. 1173), sponsored by Reps. Capps, Jones, Schakowsky and Butterfield and Sens. Schumer, Boxer, McCaskill and others, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act).\nGilbert represents SD3, LLC, which owns SawStop, a table saw manufacturer whose table saws are equipped with technology that stops a spinning saw blade in milliseconds when it comes in contact with human flesh.  Gilbert has worked with SawStop and a coalition of consumer protection groups in an effort to enact a mandatory safety standard so that all table saws contain injury mitigation technology to prevent amputations and other serious laceration injuries. The CPSC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011  and in 2015 the commission's staff urged adoption of the new requirement.Gilbert is working with a coalition of patients with diseases caused by asbestos exposure and their families to defeat the proposed Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency (FACT) Act of 2015 (H.R. 526, S. 357). The proposal would require asbestos trusts to file quarterly reports about the payouts they make and personal information on the victims who receive them in a publicly accessible database. Opponents argue that this would violate the privacy of victims and use trust funds to meet the new administrative requirements, making it more difficult for asbestos claimants to receive timely and full compensation.\n\nNotable writings\nIn 2008, Gilbert wrote a chapter entitled \"Consumer Product Safety Commission: Safety First\" for Change for America: A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President, published by the Center for American Progress and the New Democracy Project.In 2010, Gilbert authored a chapter in Materials on Tort Reform by Professor Andrew Popper of the Washington College of Law at American University.In 2012, Gilbert co-authored with Victoria Romanenko a chapter in Private Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws in the United States (edited by Albert A. Foer and Randy M. Stutz).\n\nControversy\nIn 2001, Gilbert stepped down as executive director of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) after President Bush sparked a constitutional controversy by seeking to replace the leadership of the Commission, citing his powers under Article Two of the United States Constitution.  Later, in 2008, Gilbert was mentioned as a possible appointee by President Barack Obama to be Chairman of the Commission.  However, her nomination was criticized on the grounds that while she was executive director of the CPSC, the agency was known for its \"strident enforcement efforts\" contrary to large business interests.\n\nPersonal life\nGilbert is married to Charles Lewis, Professor of Journalism at American University, founder of the Center for Public Integrity, and a former producer for 60 Minutes.  With Lewis she raises two children, Cassandra and Gabriel.\n\nSee also\nCuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\nPassage 10:\nEliezer ben Jacob I\nEliezer ben Jacob I (Hebrew: אליעזר בן יעקב) was a Tanna of the 1st century; contemporary of Eleazar Chisma and Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, and senior to Judah ben Ilai.Of his personal history nothing is known, except that he had seen the Temple at Jerusalem and was familiar with the specific purposes of its many apartments, a subject on which he was considered an authority. Some of the details, however, he eventually forgot, and was reminded of them by Abba Saul ben Batnit.Simon ben Azzai, Rabbi Akiva's contemporary, relates that he had discovered a genealogical roll wherein was stated, \"The Mishnah of R. Eliezer ben Jacob is only a kab [small in proportion], but clean [of all deficiencies]\"; as a result, subsequent generations generally adopted Eliezer's views as law.In the aggadah, too, he is mentioned. According to him, Deuteronomy 11:13 (\"To serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul\") is an admonition to the priests that, when officiating, they shall entertain no thought foreign to their duty.Eliezer ben Jacob bequeathed to Israel many agrarian laws, such as the laws concerning the bringing of the Bikkurim to Jerusalem and who is eligible to recite the Avowal, as well as the laws concerning Kil'ayim grown in a vineyard.He is buried near the old Kefar Hanaiah, in Galilee.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMikkeli hostage crisis\nThe Mikkeli hostage crisis, or Jakomäki bank robbery took place on 8–9 August 1986, which ended in Mikkeli, South Savo, Finland, outside of the Mikkeli County Government House on Maaherrankatu. The crisis began when the perpetrator, Jorma Kalevi Takala (born July 11, 1950) took three hostages in Helsinki in a bank robbery, with whom he traveled by car to Mikkeli. The event ended when Takala blew up his car, killing himself and hostage Jukka Häkkinen (born May 13, 1961). In the aftermath of the incident, the Finnish police were subjected to harsh criticism.\n\nEvents\nThe events began on 8 August 1986, when Jorma Takala, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and an explosive charge, entered the Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank in Jakomäki, Helsinki. Takala took twelve people inside the bank as his hostages. After receiving 2.5  million Finnish marks and a getaway car in exchange for most of the hostages, he left the bank with three remaining hostages, two female and one male. Takala forced the male hostage to drive the car, following Highway 4 and later Highway 5. \nThe party arrived in Mikkeli on 9 August, where they parked in front of the Mikkeli County Government House. Finnish police surrounded the vehicle and tried to negotiate with Takala. When he threatened to blow up the car if he was not allowed to continue his journey, the police advised the hostages to leave the vehicle. Both female hostages complied, after which the police started to shoot at the car. In response, Takala detonated the charge and destroyed the vehicle, killing both himself and the male hostage. Nine police officers were injured in the explosion.\n\nAftermath\nThe police received much criticism for its handling of the crisis. Nobody knew who gave the order to shoot at the car and initially none of the police commanders took the responsibility for the operation. After an investigation by the NBI, Chancellor of Justice Jorma S. Aalto decided not to prosecute the police officers for the events. In 1993, the Supreme Court of Finland convicted the police commissioner who led the operation of involuntary manslaughter and negligence and fined him 6,000 mk.\nPassage 2:\nGraham Perkin\nEdwin Graham Perkin (16 December 1929 – 16 October 1975) was an Australian journalist and newspaper editor.\n\nEarly life\nPerkin was born at Hopetoun, Victoria, elder son of Herbert Edwin Perkin, baker, and his wife Iris Lily, née Graham, both Victorian born. Graham grew up at Warracknabeal and was educated at the local high school. In 1948 he began to study law at the University of Melbourne, but abandoned his course in the following year when he obtained a cadetship with The Age. At the Methodist Church, St Kilda, on 6 September 1952 he married Peggy Lorraine Corrie.\n\nCareer\nAs a young reporter, Perkin rapidly acquired a reputation for enthusiasm and restless energy. In 1955 he won a Kemsley scholarship in journalism which took him to London. Returning to Australia as a feature writer, he shared the Walkley Award for journalism in 1959 for an article on pioneering heart surgery. His rise in the newspaper hierarchy was rapid: he became deputy news editor in 1959, news editor in 1963, assistant-editor in 1964 and editor (at the age of 36) in 1966. He was appointed to the additional post of editor-in-chief in 1973.\nPerkin turned The Age into a more interventionist and campaigning newspaper. It exposed financial scandals in State governments and corruption in the police force, and attacked Federal governments for suppressing information. In the process, it attracted critics who thought it too 'leftist'. In 1972 The Age, which had traditionally supported Coalition governments, advocated the election of Gough Whitlam's Australian Labor Party. When that government was forced to an early election in 1974, Perkin wanted to support Whitlam again. His stand led to a conflict with the board of David Syme & Co. Ltd, owner and publisher of The Age. A compromise, supported by the managing director Ranald Macdonald, narrowly averted Perkin's resignation. It also reinforced his insistence on editorial independence, subject to the management's right to dismiss an editor in whom it had lost confidence.\nHowever, Perkin turned violently on Whitlam a year later when he published details of a murky land deal involving Phillip Cairns, the son of Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns, and Rex Connor, the Minister for Minerals and Energy. Perkin had won a bidding war for the information, setting aside his normal opposition to buying stories because he felt the story was one of overwhelming importance. Perkin's editorials grew more and more critical of Whitlam, culminating in the elemental editorial \"Go now, go decently\" in which he called for the government to step down. It began with the words 'We will say it straight, and clear, and at once. The Whitlam Government has run its course.' Perkin died of a heart attack on 16 October 1975 at his Sandringham home at the age of 45.\nThe Age became a more substantial, wider ranging, better written and significantly more influential newspaper. Perkin's reforms and his willingness to speak out strongly in defence of the paper's policies boosted circulation from a stagnant 180,000 in 1965 to a solid 222,000 ten years later. The company's revenues rose correspondingly. Perkin was also director (from 1966) of Australian Associated Press, its chairman in 1970-72, and a director of Reuters Ltd, London, in 1971-74.\n\nPersonal life\nHis wife, their son Steve, and their daughter Corrie – both journalists – survived him. Peggy later remarried, and died in 2012, aged 81.\n\nGraham Perkin Journalism Award\nThe Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year Award, an annual prize, was established in 1976.\n\nBibliography\nHills, Ben, Breaking News: The Golden Age of Graham Perkin, Scribe, 2010. ISBN 978-1-921640-37-7\nPassage 3:\n1991 Sacramento hostage crisis\nOn April 4, 1991, 41 employees and customers were taken hostage and held at a Good Guys! electronics store at the corner of 65th Street and Stockton Boulevard in Florin, California, near the Florin Mall (now Florin Towne Centre) for approximately eight hours by four gunmen. Near the end of the hostage crisis, six were killed: three hostages and three of the four hostage-takers.uring the siege, no significant effort was made to negotiate with Monis, as would normally be expected in a hostage situation in order to build a relationship with a gunman and persuade them to surrender. Instead, Monis received no encouragement or assistance from trained police negotiators.Help was offered by the Muslim community including the Grand Mufti and Mamdouh Habib who had known Monis personally. Habib offered to help negotiate or provide background information to the police. These offers were not taken up.It has been suggested that the police treatment of the siege as a terrorist attack may have led to errors such as making no attempt to negotiate with the gunman as would have been normal practice in other hostage situations. One commentator, Guy Rundle, questioned whether the police may have used a \"crude rule\" that \"we don't negotiate with terrorists\" that affected their procedures. It might also explain the choice of weapon in a small enclosure against a lone gunman. These factors may have directly led to the deaths of Johnson and Dawson.\n\nISIL flag\nDuring the siege, police asked Muslims in Sydney to source an ISIL flag for Monis, before obtaining their own. The police later raided several houses of people contacted by Ms Kay who was attempting to find an ISIL flag. Ms Kay assumed that the phone calls had been monitored, and that the request had been solely to find out who she would contact, lowering trust among Muslims in the NSW police force.\n\nLack of detection\nThe security forces have been criticised for not recognising that Monis was a threat, and for taking him off their watch list in 2008. This may have been because they overlooked key evidence, or it may have been because there was simply no evidence to collect. The federal/state joint review found that the relevant agencies' analysis had been reasonable.\n\nLaw and politics\nAfter the siege, the revelation that the new Bail Act had allowed Monis to be granted bail sparked calls to further tighten the law; however, a review had already been conducted in the wake of earlier controversial bail releases, with the new law set \"to take effect next year\" (that is, on 28 January 2015). Former director of public prosecutions in New South Wales, Nicholas Cowdery, said he was not sure that the amended law would have changed anything in Monis's case, saying that \"There will always be, unfortunately, some exceptional events which laws and controls put in place before the event could not have prevented\". Homicide detectives sent a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) urging them to challenge the bail decision for Monis, but a commissioned officer did not pass it on to the DPP. Michael Esposito, writing for the Law Society of South Australia, noted that the shocking nature of the Sydney siege had the power to prompt reviews of bail laws across Australia.Some commentators expressed concerns about immigration and citizenship processes. Monis's \"confused agenda\" meant that Amnesty International did not realise that he and Boroujerdim, who had sought help in 1997, were the same man until they went back through their records. In the absence of hard evidence, suggestions that Monis represented a growing trend of systemic failure, rather than being an aberration, were noted as dangerous to public confidence; to the separation of powers; to the idea of innocence till proven guilty and also to social cohesion by inviting suspicion of people from the Middle East.In the week after the siege, it was revealed that John Robertson, NSW Opposition leader, had sent a letter which passed on a request made by Monis, a constituent in his Blacktown electorate, to the Department of Family and Community Services in 2011. The letter was, according to Robertson, routine procedure on behalf of a constituent and written in support of Monis's request for a supervised visit with his children on Father's Day despite an apprehended violence order against him. The Department declined Monis's request. As pressure mounted on Robertson to resign as Leader of the Labor Party, and three months away from the 2015 state election, he stood aside on 23 December 2014.\n\nViolence\nCommentators considered Monis's history of domestic violence, with a family violence expert arguing that it should have been considered when bail was given. A columnist noted that while his behaviour highlighted an \"epidemic\" of violence towards women, the media focus remained on terrorism.Historians of religion and politics also critically reviewed the role of violence committed in the name of religion.\n\nMedia\nDebate followed about the difficulty of managing a police operation in the presence of continuous global media coverage as well as the likely damage caused by the spread of rumour. Particular criticism was levelled at Rupert Murdoch and News Corp for spreading false information as well as for insensitivity and \"gross ethical violations\". Commissioner Scipione and chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor Julian Disney released statements about the media coverage after the event. Beyond misinformation, concerns were raised regarding the presentation of crises as entertainment.Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners aired a two-part broadcast, interviewing former hostages, and the families of deceased Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.\n\nMemorials and legacy\nA month after the siege, police, ambulance workers, firefighters and others were officially thanked at NSW Government House. Memorial plaques were placed inside the reopened Lindt café. A permanent memorial to the victims of the siege will incorporate the flowers from Martin Place, which are to be mulched and incorporated into its garden element. The memorial was opened in December, 2017.The premiere of Jonathon Welch's choral piece Street Requiem in February 2015 was dedicated to the siege victims and to those who died in the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris.Composer Lyle Chan, who resides less than a kilometre from the Lindt cafe, wrote two works influenced by the events. Sea of Flowers was premiered by conductor Alondra de la Parra and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra in May 2015. Chan's Love Is Always Born (December), with original words by Michael Leunig and 'Silent Night' in Arabic, was commissioned and premiered by the Song Company at concerts around the first anniversary of the events.Dawson's family created the Katrina Dawson Foundation and scholarships to The Women's College, University of Sydney to provide financial assistance to young women for their university education. The first recipients started university in 2016.Senator Dean Smith, a homosexual Liberal Party member, changed his views on same-sex marriage in Australia due to Tori Johnson and his partner of 14 years. Smith later introduced a bill aimed at legalising same-sex marriage to the Senate, which became law.A ceremony unveiling the memorial was held on 16 December 2017.The Lindt Cafe closed in October 2021 due to lack of patronage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing construction work for the Sydney Metro.\n\nSee also\nList of mass shootings in Australia\nSydney siege inquest\n2015 Parramatta shooting\nCrime in Australia\nIslam in Australia\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFifty-state strategy\nIn the context of American politics, a fifty-state strategy is a political strategy which aims for progress in all states of the United States of America, rather than conceding certain states as \"unwinnable\". In a presidential campaign, it is usually implemented as an appeal to a broad base of the American public in an attempt to win, even if marginally, every state, since even a marginal victory is effectively a total victory for electoral purposes. It can also refer to an overall long-term strategy for a political movement such as a political party.\nThis strategy is very ambitious and, when used for a specific election, is typically abandoned as the election day draws nearer. In the vast majority of cases, winning a state's popular vote for president or senator — even by a small margin — means the state's entire representation in the election goes to the victor without being divided. A fifty-state strategy requires a campaign to spend valuable resources in a rival's strongest states, when those resources could instead be concentrated in swing states that will become a total win or a total loss based on only a small difference in popular votes.\n\nAttempts\nSuccessful\nA president has won every state three times. In 1788 and 1792, George Washington won all the electoral votes running effectively unopposed, and in 1820, James Monroe, running unopposed, carried all twenty-three states in the union at that time (although one electoral vote was cast for John Quincy Adams and two electors died prior to casting votes).\nA complete fifty-state victory has not been accomplished since the fiftieth state was admitted into the union, though there have been several landslide victories:\n\nIn 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt carried 46 of 48 states, losing only Maine and Vermont.\nIn 1972, with Richard Nixon losing only Massachusetts.\nIn 1984, with Ronald Reagan losing only his rival's home state of Minnesota, yet only doing so by about 3,000 votes.Both Nixon and Reagan also lost the District of Columbia, which has had presidential electors since the Twenty-Third Amendment in 1961.\n\nUnsuccessful\nIn 1960, the first presidential election after the admission of Alaska and Hawaii, Richard Nixon pledged to visit all 50 states following his nomination at the Republican National Convention. Nixon was defeated in the general election by Democrat John F. Kennedy, in one of the closest presidential campaigns in American history. Many observers and commentators in succeeding years, such as Larry Sabato, have criticized Nixon's fifty-state pledge as a factor in his loss, suggesting that it forced him to place less emphasis on close states. Eight years later, in 1968, Nixon ran for president again and won a three-way race against Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent candidate George Wallace. His achievement of visiting every state in his previous campaign made Nixon the first president ever to accomplish this task, though not during a winning campaign.\n\nMixed results\nHoward Dean pursued an explicit \"fifty-state strategy\" as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, putting resources into building a Democratic Party presence even where Democrats had been thought unlikely to win federal positions, in hopes that getting Democrats elected to local and state positions, and increasing awareness of Democrats in previously conceded areas, would result in growing successes in future elections. Democrats who supported the strategy have said that abandoning \"red states\" as lost causes only allowed the Republican Party to grow even stronger in areas where it was unchallenged, resulting in lopsided losses for Democrats in even more races.During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama attempted a form of the fifty-state strategy to reach into deep red states to try to flip them. This was largely based on Obama's appeal during the primaries in very Republican states, like those in the Deep South and the Great Plains. In September, Obama scaled back his fifty-state strategy, abandoning Alaska and North Dakota and reducing staff in Georgia and Montana. John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate made winning Alaska very unlikely for Obama, and she also had strong support in North Dakota. Obama was ultimately able to win Virginia and Indiana, two states that had not voted Democratic since 1964, and North Carolina, last won by a Democrat in 1976. Virginia has since become a reliably Democratic state. Additionally, the margins of victory in North Dakota, Georgia, and Montana were considerably closer than they had been in 2004.\n\nSee also\nElectoral College (United States)\nRed states and blue states\nPassage 2:\nTerritory of Hawaii\nThe Territory of Hawaii or Hawaii Territory (Hawaiian: Panalāʻau o Hawaiʻi) was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from April 30, 1900, until August 21, 1959, when most of its territory, excluding Palmyra Island, was admitted to the United States as the 50th U.S. state, the State of Hawaii. The Hawaii Admission Act specified that the State of Hawaii would not include Palmyra Island, the Midway Islands, Kingman Reef, and Johnston Atoll, which includes Johnston (or Kalama) Island and Sand Island.On July 4, 1898, the United States Congress passed the Newlands Resolution authorizing the U.S. annexation of the Republic of Hawaii, and five weeks later, on August 12, Hawaii became a U.S. territory. In April 1900 Congress approved the Hawaiian Organic Act which organized the territory. United States Public Law 103-150 adopted in 1993, (informally known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that \"the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States\" and also \"that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum\".Hawaii's territorial history includes a period from 1941 to 1944, during World War II, when the islands were placed under martial law. Civilian government was dissolved and a military governor was appointed.\n\nBackground\nUpon the overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani in January 1893, the Committee of Safety established the Provisional Government of Hawaii and set out to effect Hawaii's speedy annexation by the United States. A commission, led by Lorrin A. Thurston, was sent to Washington D.C. to negotiate an annexation treaty with President Benjamin Harrison. A delegation led by Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani also went to Washington to protest the overthrow and to lobby against annexation.\nHarrison and the commission signed a treaty of annexation, which was sent to the U.S. Senate for approval. In March 1893, before the Senate could ratify it, Grover Cleveland took office. The new president was an anti-imperialist and strongly opposed to annexation. He withdrew the treaty from consideration, ordered a congressional investigation into the events.\n\nTom Nairn and the revival of nationalism\nMarxist historian Tom Nairn has argued that uneven development can also lead to peripheral nationalism, for example in Scotland.  Peripheral regions tend to promote nationalist movements when regional inequalities overlap with ethnic differences, or when membership of a larger state no longer presents advantages. In underdeveloped regions, nationalist movements mobilise the population against the persistence of ethnic economic inequality.\n\nHelena Norberg-Hodge and uneven development in Northern India\nHelena Norberg-Hodge is an economist who spent more than 30 years in Ladakh. She argues that uneven development and crises often affect people now because of past economic activities. To solve the problem, the fundamental economic approach needs change from \"globalizing\" to \"localizing\". Localization can contribute to reduce CO2 emission, solve the economic problems, and restore biodiversity as well as cultural diversity. Localizing is one of the ways to create secure jobs in the global population.\nNorberg-Hodge based her argument on her experience of witnessing changes in Ladakh, before and after the region was subsidized to enhance economic activities and promote development. The subsidies meant that products from thousands of miles away could be sold cheaper than locally made products, which destroyed the local market. It quickly lead to unemployment and religious strife. Norberg-Hodge raised critical questions about the effects of  spending on infrastructure (such as roads) intended to stimulate the economy and reduce costs, in order to achieve greater social wellbeing. The point is, that the globalized economy enables people to control other places from a far distance, without knowing the situation in the region. Large investments subsidizing the transportation system make products from thousands of miles away cheaper than locally made products. Rather than improving the local community, the local market collapses and local people lose their jobs, while investors far away make a lot of profit from business ventures that create more unequal development than there was before.\n\nSee also\nAlexander Gerschenkron\nBackwardness\nDevelopment theory\nLate industrialisation\nNon-simultaneity\nStrategy of unbalanced growth\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nCloward–Piven strategy\nThe Cloward–Piven strategy is a political strategy outlined in 1966 by American sociologists and political activists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven.\n\nHistory\nCloward and Piven were both professors at the Columbia University School of Social Work. The strategy was outlined in a May 1966 article in the liberal magazine The Nation titled  \"The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty\".The two stated that many Americans who were eligible for welfare were not receiving benefits, and that a welfare enrollment drive would strain local budgets, precipitating a crisis at the state and local levels that would be a wake-up call for the federal government, particularly the Democratic Party. There would also be side consequences of this strategy, according to Cloward and Piven. These would include: easing the plight of the poor in the short-term (through their participation in the welfare system); shoring up support for the national Democratic Party-then splintered by pluralistic interests (through its cultivation of poor and minority constituencies by implementing a national \"solution\" to poverty); and relieving local governments of the financially and politically onerous burdens of public welfare (through a national \"solution\" to poverty).\n\nStrategy\nCloward and Piven's article is focused on forcing the Democratic Party, which in 1966 controlled the presidency and both houses of the United States Congress, to take federal action to help the poor. They stated that full enrollment of those eligible for welfare \"would produce bureaucratic disruption in welfare agencies and fiscal disruption in local and state governments\" that would: \"...deepen existing divisions among elements in the big-city Democratic coalition: the remaining white middle class, the working-class ethnic groups and the growing minority poor. To avoid a further weakening of that historic coalition, a national Democratic administration would be constrained to advance a federal solution to poverty that would override local welfare failures, local class and racial conflicts and local revenue dilemmas.\"They further wrote:\n\nThe ultimate objective of this strategy—to wipe out poverty by establishing a guaranteed annual income—will be questioned by some. Because the ideal of individual social and economic mobility has deep roots, even activists seem reluctant to call for national programs to eliminate poverty by the outright redistribution of income.\nMichael Reisch and Janice Andrews wrote that Cloward and Piven \"proposed to create a crisis in the current welfare system – by exploiting the gap between welfare law and practice – that would ultimately bring about its collapse and replace it with a system of guaranteed annual income. They hoped to accomplish this end by informing the poor of their rights to welfare assistance, encouraging them to apply for benefits and, in effect, overloading an already overburdened bureaucracy.\"\n\nFocus on Democrats\nThe authors pinned their hopes on creating disruption within the Democratic Party: \"Conservative Republicans are always ready to declaim the evils of public welfare, and they would probably be the first to raise a hue and cry. But deeper and politically more telling conflicts would take place within the Democratic coalition...Whites – both working class ethnic groups and many in the middle class – would be aroused against the ghetto poor, while liberal groups, which until recently have been comforted by the notion that the poor are few... would probably support the movement. Group conflict, spelling political crisis for the local party apparatus, would thus become acute as welfare rolls mounted and the strains on local budgets became more severe.”\n\nReception and criticism\nMichael Tomasky, writing about the strategy in the 1990s and again in 2011, called it \"wrongheaded and self-defeating\", writing: \"It apparently didn't occur to [Cloward and Piven] that the system would just regard rabble-rousing black people as a phenomenon to be ignored or quashed.\"\n\nImpact of the strategy\nIn papers published in 1971 and 1977, Cloward and Piven argued that mass unrest in the United States, especially between 1964 and 1969, did lead to a massive expansion of welfare rolls, though not to the guaranteed-income program that they had hoped for. Political scientist Robert Albritton disagreed, writing in 1979 that the data did not support this thesis; he offered an alternative explanation for the rise in welfare caseloads.\nIn his 2006 book Winning the Race, political commentator John McWhorter attributed the rise in the welfare state after the 1960s to the Cloward–Piven strategy, but wrote about it negatively, stating that the strategy \"created generations of black people for whom working for a living is an abstraction\".According to historian Robert E. Weir in 2007: \"Although the strategy helped to boost recipient numbers between 1966 and 1975, the revolution its proponents envisioned never transpired.\"\n\nSee also\nGuaranteed minimum income\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJerry Schumacher\nJerry Schumacher is an American coach for the University of Oregon track and field and cross country program, specializing in distance running. He has coached Olympic silver medalist and the former American women's 10k record holder Shalane Flanagan, former Canadian 10k record holder Simon Bairu, the former men's American 10k record holder Chris Solinsky, the men's American two mile record holder Matt Tegenkamp, and the women's NCAA 10k record holder Lisa Koll. Prior to 2008 he was the head coach of the University of Wisconsin–Madison track and field team.During his college years at the University of Wisconsin, Schumacher specialized in the 1500m, an event in which he would become an All-American and set a personal best of 3:39.\nAfter a brief period of post-collegiate running, Schumacher quickly transitioned into coaching, accepting a job as an assistant coach at the University of North Carolina.\nThe Head Men's Distance Coaching job at Wisconsin opened up, and it was an easy decision to move back to his home state and coach the Badgers. Over the next 9 years, Schumacher established Wisconsin as one of the premier distance schools in the country by bringing in top-level recruits and slowly developing his athletes.\nHe is now the coach of the Bowerman Track Club, a running club based in Portland, Oregon which has produced 28 Olympians during his tenure. In July 2022, the University of Oregon announced the hire of Schumacher as head Cross Country and Track and Field Coach, replacing Robert Johnson.Schumacher is the father of 4 children.\nPassage 2:\nAto Boldon\nAto Jabari Boldon  (born 30 December 1973) is a Trinidadian former track and field athlete, politician, and four-time Olympic medal winner. He holds the Trinidad and Tobago national record in the 50, 60 and 200 metres events with times of 5.64, 6.49 and 19.77 seconds respectively, and also the Commonwealth Games record in the 100 m. He also held the 100m national record at 9.86s, having run it four times until Richard Thompson ran 9.85s on 13 August 2011.\nAfter retiring from his track career, Boldon was an Opposition Senator in the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament, representing the United National Congress from 2006–2007. Boldon works as an NBC Sports television broadcast analyst for track and field.\n\nCareer\nEarly life and junior career\nBoldon was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago to a Jamaican mother, and Trinidadian father, Hope and Guy Boldon. He attended Fatima College (Secondary School) in Trinidad before leaving for the United States at age fourteen. In December 1989, as a soccer player at Jamaica High School in Queens, New York City, head track and field coach Joe Trupiano noticed his sprinting abilities during a soccer practice session.In his first track season at age 16, Boldon finished with 21.20 seconds in the 200 metres and 48.40 seconds in the 400 metres, recording a double win at the Queens County Championships in 1990, and earning MVP honours. After transferring for his final year from Jamaica High to Piedmont Hills High School in San Jose, California, Boldon was selected to the San Jose Mercury News' Santa Clara all-county soccer team. He also continued to sprint, placing third in the 200 m at the CIF California State Meet in 1991. Athletics became his primary focus and he won the Junior Olympic Title that summer in Durham, North Carolina, in 200 m.\nAt 18, Boldon represented Trinidad and Tobago at 100 metres and 200 m in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona but did not qualify in the first round of either event. Boldon returned to the junior circuit, winning the 100 m and 200 m titles at the IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics in Seoul, South Korea to become the first double sprint champion in World Junior Championships history.\nBoldon was also an NCAA Champion while enrolled as a sociology major at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1995 in the 200 m. In 1996, he secured an NCAA 100 m Championship in Eugene, Oregon in the final race of his collegiate career, setting an NCAA meet record of 9.92. Boldon also held the collegiate 100 m record with 9.90 s from 1996 until it was broken by Travis Padgett, who ran 9.89s, in 2008. Ngonidzashe Makusha later equalled this record at the 2011 NCAA Championships in Des Moines, Iowa\n\nSenior athletics\nBoldon won his first international senior-level medal at the 1995 World Championships, taking home the bronze in the 100 m. At the time, he was the youngest athlete ever at 21 years of age to win a medal in that event. The following year at the 1996 Summer Olympics, he again placed third in the 100 m and 200 m events, both behind world records. In 1997, he won the 200 m at the World Championships in Athens, Greece; his country's first world title in the Athletics World Championships. This made him one of only a few male sprinters to win both a World Junior and World Senior title.\nThe following year saw Boldon reaching the peak of his career, setting a new personal best and national record of 9.86 s in the 100 m at the Mt. SAC Relays in Walnut, California on 19 April and repeating the feat in Athens on 17 June. He picked up gold in the 100 m at the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, setting a record time of 9.88 s, beating Namibia's Frankie Fredericks (9.96 s) and Barbados' Obadele Thompson (10.00 s). The Commonwealth Games 100 m record remains unbroken.In 1999, Boldon ran 9.86 s twice in the 100 m before sustaining a serious hamstring injury which forced him to miss the World Championships in Seville – the only Championship he missed in his career due to injury.\nA silver medal in the 100 m and a bronze in the 200 m were Boldon's results of the 2000 Summer Olympics, which was a personal victory, considering his comeback from a career-threatening injury the year before. This win made him the most successful individual Olympic medallist from Trinidad and Tobago with four Olympic medals.\nIn 2001, Boldon tested positive at an early-season relay meet for the stimulant ephedrine, and was given a warning, but was not suspended orof 19.84 seconds in the process. His medal made it an all-Jamaican podium finish alongside fellow Racers Track Club athletes Bolt and Blake – the first time Jamaican men had achieved such a medal sweep at the Olympics.Weir started out his 2013 season with a victory of 20.11 seconds in the Adidas Grand Prix in New York City. In June, he registered a 10.02 100m run, a massive personal best from his previous record of 10.51 seconds in 2008. Later in the 2013 Jamaican National Championships, Weir cruised to the finish line in the 200m final in 19.79 seconds, tying Bolt's world leading mark at that point. Having won the first two of his diamond league 200m races (in the Golden Grand Prix and the Adidas Grand Prix), Weir finished second to Bolt at the Meeting Areva, where Bolt set a world lead and meeting record of 19.73. Despite the clear loss to Bolt in Paris, Weir looked to be the closest to a challenger for Bolt at the World Championships that year. At the London Anniversary Games Weir clocked an impressive 19.89 and followed this up with a meeting record in the relay, clocking 37.75.\nCome the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, Weir took the heats easily and made it to the final. In the final, Bolt won the race in a world leading time of 19.66 to become the first man to win the 200m at the world championships three times. Weir got clear silver at 19.79, equalling his best, and Curtis Mitchell the bronze in 20.04. Weir would later collect a gold in the 4 × 100 m, after running in the heats. Weir finished his season off by winning the 200m at the Memorial Van Damme in Brussels and hence won the Diamond League.\nIn 2014, Weir competed in the Commonwealth Games, running the 200m.  After winning his heats, Weir won the silver medal in the final.\nHe is known for saying \"No English, straight Patois,\" sparking calls on social networks for T-shirts to be printed with the phrase.In August 2017 Weir announced his retirement from competition via his Instagram account, after not advancing from the heats in the 200m at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in London.In a change of sport, Weir was a member of the Jamaica rugby sevens team that came third at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games.\n\nStatistics\nPersonal bests\n100 metres: 10.02 sec (2013)\n200 metres: 19.79 sec (2013)\n400 metres: 46.10 sec (2013)\n110 metres hurdles (junior): 13.65 sec (2007)\n400 metres hurdles: 53.28 sec (2009)\n\nInternational competition record\nPassage 10:\nMen's 100 metres world record progression\nThe first record in the 100 metres for men (athletics) was recognised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation, now known as World Athletics, in 1912.\nAs of 21 June 2011, the IAAF had ratified 67 records in the event, not including rescinded records.\n\nUnofficial progression before the IAAF\nIAAF record progression\n\"Wind\" in these tables refers to wind assistance, the velocity of the wind parallel to the runner - positive values are from the starting line towards the finish line, negative are from the finish line towards the starting line, 0 is no wind in either direction, and all values are measured in metres per second.  Any wind perpendicular to the runners (from left to right, right to left, or up to down or down to up, although the conditions of the track generally preclude those wind directions) is ignored and not listed.\n\"Auto\" refers to automatic timing, and for the purposes of these lists, indicates auto times which were either also taken for hand-timed records, or were rounded to the tenth or hundredth of a second (depending on the rounding rules then in effect) for the official record time.\n\nRecords 1912–1976\nThe first manual time of 9.9 seconds was recorded for Bob Hayes in the final of the 100 metres at the 1964 Olympics. Hayes' official time of 10.0 seconds was determined by rounding down the electronic time of 10.06 to the nearest tenth of a second, giving the appearance of a manual time. This method was unique to the Olympics of 1964 and 1968, and the officials at the track recorded Hayes' time as 9.9 seconds.\n\nRecords since 1977\nSince 1975, the IAAF has accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting on January 1, 1977, the IAAF has required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these events.Jim Hines' October 1968 Olympic gold medal run was the fastest recorded fully electronic 100 metre race up to that date, at 9.95 seconds. Track and Field News has compiled an unofficial list of automatically timed records starting with the 1964 Olympics and Bob Hayes' gold medal performance there. Those marks are included in the progression.\nThe event is linked on some of the dates.\n\nLow-altitude record progression 1968–1987\nThe IAAF considers marks set at high altitude as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances. One estimate suggests times in the 200 m sprint can be assisted by between 0.09 s and 0.14 s with the maximum allowable tailing wind of (2.0 m/s), and gain 0.3 s at altitudes over 2000 m. For this reason, unofficial low-altitude record lists have been compiled.\nAfter the IAAF started to recognise only electronic times in 1977, the then-current record and subsequent record were both set at altitude. It was not until 1987 that the world record was equalled or surpassed by a low-altitude performance. The following progression of low-altitude records therefore starts with Hines's low-altitude \"record\" when the IAAF started to recognise only electronic timing in 1977, and continues to Lewis's low-altitude performance that equalled the high-altitude world record in 1987. (Ben Johnson's 9.95 run in 1986 and 9.83 run in 1987 are omitted.)\n\nSee also\nWomen's 100 metres world record progression\nMen's 200 metres world record progression\n100-yard dash\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

She was involved in the Denver, Colorado, community and served on a number of boards, including the Denver Metro Convention and Visitor's Bureau; Sportswomen of Colorado, Inc.; the Denver Center for the Performing Arts; and the Metropolitan Football Stadium District. Burns was also a founder of the Colorado Women's Foundation and of the Colorado Business Bank. She was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame in 1998, the Colorado Tourism and Travel Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2000.\nBurns' work with the University of Denver started in 1972 when she began volunteering with the Women's Library Association. In 1981, she joined the board of trustees. Nine years later she became chairman of the board, becoming the first woman to hold the post. She has been a trustee for 30 years and supported the Joy Burns Arena at the Ritchie Center and the Joy Burns Plaza in the Newman Center for the Performing Arts. In addition, she supports the Franklin L. Burns School of Real Estate and Construction Management, named after her late husband. Burns was inducted into the University of Denver Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. She was also the recipient of the 2005 DU Josef Korbel Humanitarian Award and the 2008 award for Distinguished Service to the university.\nBurns died in 2020 at age 92.\nPassage 2:\nDenver Broncos\nThe Denver Broncos are a professional American football franchise based in Denver, Colorado. The Broncos compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The team is headquartered in Dove Valley, Colorado.\nThe team began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) and joined the NFL as part of the merger in 1970. The Broncos are currently owned by the Walton-Penner group, and play their home games at Empower Field at Mile High; Denver previously played its home games at Mile High Stadium from its inception in 1960 through the 2000 season.\nThe Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not have a winning season until 1973 and qualified for their first playoffs in 1977, eventually advancing to Super Bowl XII that season. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's most successful teams, having suffered only eleven losing seasons. They have won eight AFC Championships (1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, 2015), and three Super Bowl championships (1997 (XXXII), 1998 (XXXIII), 2015 (50), and share the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5 — tied with the New England Patriots). The Broncos have eight primary members enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: John Elway, Floyd Little, Shannon Sharpe, Gary Zimmerman, Terrell Davis, Champ Bailey, and Steve Atwater, along with late club owner Pat Bowlen.\n\nFranchise history\nBob Howsman/Gerald Phipps era (1960–1980)\nThe Denver Broncos were founded on August 14, 1959, when minor league baseball owner Bob Howsam was awarded an American Football League (AFL) charter franchise. The Broncos won the first-ever AFL game over the Boston Patriots 13–10, on September 9, 1960. Seven years later on August 5, 1967, they became the first-ever AFL team to defeat an NFL team, with a 13–7 win over the Detroit Lions in a preseason game. However, the Broncos were not successful in the 1960s, winning more than five games only once (7–7, 1962), compiling a 39–97–4 (.293) record during the ten seasons of the AFL.Denver came close to losing its franchise in 1965, until a local ownership group took control, and rebuilt the team. The team's first superstar, \"Franchise\" Floyd Little, was instrumental in keeping the team in Denver, due to his signing in 1967 as well as his Pro Bowl efforts on and off the field. The Broncos were the only original AFL team that never played in the title game, as well as the only original AFL team never to have a winning season while a member of the AFL during the upstart league's 10-year history.In 1972, the Broncos hired former Stanford University coach John Ralston as their head coach. In 1973, he was the UPI's AFC Coach of the Year, after Denver achieved its first winning season at 7–5–2. In five seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to three winning seasons. Though Ralston finished the 1976 season with a 9–5 record, the team, as was the case in Ralston's previous winning seasons, still missed the playoffs. Following the season, several prominent players publicly voiced their discontent with Ralston, which soon led to his resignation.\n\nRed Miller, a long-time assistant coach, was hired and along with the Orange Crush Defense (a nickname originated in 1977, also the brand of the popular orange-flavored soft drink) and aging quarterback Craig Morton, took the Broncos to what was then a record-setting 12–2 regular-season record and their first playoff appearance in 1977, and ultimately made their first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XII, in which they were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys (Morton's former team), 27–10.\n\nEdgar Kaiser/Pat Bowlen era (1981–2018)\nIn 1981, Broncos' owner Gerald Phipps, who had purchased the team in May 1961 from the original owner Bob Howsam, sold the team to Canadian financier Edgar Kaiser Jr., grandson of shipbuilding industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. In 1984, the team was purchased by another Canadian, Pat Bowlen, who placed team ownership into a family trust sometime before 2004 and remained in day-to-day control until his battle with Alzheimer's disease forced him to cede the team to Joe Ellis in 2014.\n\nDan Reeves years (1981–1992)\nDan Reeves became the youngest head coach in the NFL when he joined the Broncos in 1981 as vice president and head coach. Quarterback John Elway, who played college football at Stanford, arrived in 1983 via a trade. Originally drafted by the Baltimore Colnative Wisconsin. Bowlen later earned degrees in business (1965) and law (1968) from the University of Oklahoma. During his time at Oklahoma he played for the Oklahoma Sooners freshman football team as a wide receiver, as well as for the Edmonton Huskies junior football team, where he was part of three Canadian Junior Football League Championship teams from 1962 to 1964.The younger Bowlen became wealthier by becoming a successful lawyer in Edmonton, Alberta. Bowlen also worked as an executive for his father's company and as a real estate developer and had major investments in the mining industry. During his business career in Edmonton his construction company, Batoni-Bowlen Enterprises, built the Northlands Coliseum, which would become home to the WHA/NHL's Edmonton Oilers for 42 years.\nBowlen was an initiated member of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity. Bowlen was initiated by the University of Oklahoma, Beta Omicron chapter in 1963. Bowlen received bar admission in 1969 and was a member of the Law Society of Alberta and the Canadian Bar Association.\n\nDenver Broncos ownership\nBowlen bought a majority interest in the Denver Broncos of the National Football League in March of 1984 from Vancouver industrialist Edgar Kaiser Jr. The purchase price was said to be $70 million, making the Broncos the highest-priced franchise in the league at the time.From 1999 to 2008, Bowlen and the Broncos were involved in several legal battles against former owner Edgar Kaiser Jr. In 1998, Bowlen agreed to sell retired football legend John Elway a share in the team. When Bowlen let the existence of the offer slip out to Kaiser while both were at the 1999 Bohemian Grove, Kaiser sued, claiming a breach of contract. Kaiser asserted that he had the right of first refusal if any deal was made involving franchise ownership. In 2004, a jury ruled in favor of Kaiser and a federal judge decreed that Kaiser was entitled to purchase back 10% of the Broncos using the identical purchase terms offered to Elway. Bowlen appealed the original verdict that ruled in favor of Kaiser and won in 2008, as the appellate court ruled that the structure of the Bowlen-Elway deal did not violate the original right of first refusal agreement.On December 30, 2008, Broncos head coach and Vice President of Football Operations Mike Shanahan was fired by Bowlen after a 14-year tenure as the head coach. Bowlen stated he wanted his team to go in a different direction. Bowlen searched for a new head coach over a two-week period and eventually chose Josh McDaniels, who at the time was the offensive coordinator of the New England Patriots. Subsequently, after a losing streak in the 2010 season, McDaniels was fired as head coach of the Broncos. On February 12, 2009, Bowlen appointed Brian Xanders as the team's sole general manager and fired Jim and Jeff Goodman.\nWithin two weeks of the end of the 2010-11 regular season, Bowlen and the Broncos had hired former Carolina Panthers' coach John Fox to be their new head coach. Although Bowlen had discussions with Fox before the hiring, new front-office executive John Elway was mostly responsible for the hiring. By late 2009, rumors had begun to emerge that Bowlen had stepped out of the spotlight because of short-term memory loss. He told The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige that his memory wasn't what it used to be and that he couldn't recall details of the Broncos back-to-back Super Bowl titles in the late 1990s. Starting in 2010, Bowlen no longer played a major role in the Broncos' decision making, and Executive VP John Elway and President Joe Ellis assumed control. On July 23, 2014, due to complications with Alzheimer's disease, he officially relinquished control of the team to Joe Ellis.On November 1, 2015, Bowlen was inducted into the Broncos' Ring of Fame, earning him a bronze plaque that stands on the south side of Empower Field at Mile High.After Bowlen acquired the team in 1984, the Broncos briefly held the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the National Football League (334 wins, 212 losses, and 1 tie, for a .612 winning percentage), passing the San Francisco 49ers after the 2015 season. At the time of Bowlen's death, the New England Patriots had surpassed that figure.\n\nColorado Crush ownership\nBesides being owner and CEO of the Broncos, Bowlen was also part-owner of the Arena Football League's Colorado Crush. He shared ownership with Denver-based sports mogul Stan Kroenke and legendary Broncos quarterback John Elway. The Crush entered the AFL as an expansion franchise in 2003. After going through a 2–14 season in 2003, the team became a perennial playoff contender and one of the league's top franchises. The Crush won the Arena Football League Championship in 2005.\n\nDenver Outlaws ownership\nIn 2006, Major League Lacrosse decided to expand adding the Denver Outlaws to its league of teams. The Denver Outlaws have been the most winning franchise that Bowlen has ever owned, boasting a regular-season win percentage of 69.0% since their creation. The Outlaws have been to the playoffs every year of their existence except one (2015) and advanced to the championship game eight times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018), winning the championship in 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nPhilanthropy\nBowlen was a member of the University of Denver Board of Trustees and contributed to the funding of the Pat Bowlen Athletic Training Center located on the school's campus.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAustrobaileyales\nAustrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas. The best-known species is Illicium verum, commonly known as star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade (Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales), which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants. Austrobaileyales is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside the ANA grade.The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, Austrobaileya scandens, a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas.\n\nIn different classifications\nUntil the early 21st century, the order was only rarely recognised by systems of classification (an exception is the Reveal system).\nThe APG system, of 1998, did not recognize such an order. The APG II system, of 2003, does accept this order and places it among the basal angiosperms, that is: it does not belong to any further clade. APG II uses this circumscription:\n\norder Austrobaileyales\nfamily Austrobaileyaceae, one species of woody vines from Australia\nfamily Schisandraceae [+ family Illiciaceae], several dozen species of woody plants, found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The best known of those is Star anise.\nfamily Trimeniaceae, half-a-dozen species of woody plants found in subtropical to tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and the Pacific IslandsNote: \"+ ...\"=optional segregate family, that may be split off from the preceding family. The Cronquist system, of 1981, also placed the  plants in families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae together, but as separate families, united at the rank of order, in the order Illiciales.\nPassage 2:\nTibouchina\nTibouchina  is a neotropical flowering plant genus in the family Melastomataceae. Species of this genus are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees and typically have purple flowers. They are native to Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America where they are found as far south as northern Argentina. Members of this genus are known as glory bushes, glory trees or princess flowers. The name Tibouchina is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus. A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic, and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus.\n\nDescription\nTibouchina species are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees. Their leaves are opposite, usually with petioles, and often covered with scales. The inflorescence is a panicle or some modification of a panicle with reduced branching. The individual flowers have five free petals, purple or lilac in color; the color does not change as the flowers age. There are ten stamens, either all the same or dimorphic, with five larger and five smaller ones. The connective tissue below the anthers of the stamens is prolonged and modified at the base of the stamens into ventrally bilobed appendages. When mature, the seeds are contained in a dry, semiwoody capsule and are cochleate (spiralled).\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Tibouchina was established by Aublet in 1775 in his Flora of French Guiana with the description of a single species, T. aspera, which is thus the type species. In 1885, in his treatment for Flora brasiliensis, Alfred Cogniaux used a broad concept of the genus, transferring into it many of the species at that time placed in Chaetogastra, Diplostegium, Lasiandra, Pleroma and Purpurella, among others. This broad concept was generally adopted subsequently, and around 470 taxa were at one time or another assigned to Tibouchina.\n\nPhylogeny\nA phylogenetic analysis in 2013 based on molecular data (2 plastid and 1 nuclear regions) determined that the traditional circumscription of Tibouchina was paraphyletic. Four major clades were resolved within the genus which were supported by morphological, molecular and geographic evidence. Based on the traditional code of nomenclature, the clade that the type species falls in retains the name of the genus; therefore, the clade containing Tibouchina aspera remains Tibouchina.A further molecular phylogenetic study in 2019 used the same molecular markers but included more species. It reached the same conclusion: the original broadly circumscribed Tibouchina consisted of four monophyletic clades. The authors proposed a split into four genera: a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus. The relationship between Chaetogastra and the genus Brachyotum differed between a maximum likelihood analysis and a Bayesian inference analysis: the former found Brachyotum embedded within Chaetogastra, the latter found the two to be sisters. The part of their maximum likelihood cladogram which includes former Tibouchina species is as follows, using their genus names and with shading added to show the original broadly circumscribed Tibouchina s.l.:\n\nAs re-circumscribed, Tibouchina is monophyletic and contains species belonging to the traditional sections T. section Tibouchina and T. section Barbigerae. Diagnostic characteristics include the presence of scale-like trichomes on the hypanthium and leaves and a long pedoconnective on lilac anthers, and the absence of glandular trichomes. Species are found in savanna habitats.\n\nSpecies\nAs of May 2022, Plants of the World Online accepts the following species within Tibouchina:\n\nSelected former species\nSpecies placed in Tibouchina in its former broad sense include:\n\nDistribution and invasive potential\nAll the species of Tibouchina are native to the Americas as far north as Mexico south to northern Argentina, with many found in Brazil, and others in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Members of Tibouchina tend to be found in lowland savannas and on the lower slopes of the Andes. All Tibouchina species as well as those formerly placed in the genus are considered noxious weeds in Hawaii, because of their high potential for being invasive species. Many species, such as T. araguaiensis, T. papyrus, T. mathaei and T. nigricans, have narrow distributions, being known from only a handful of locations, while a few other species, including T. aspera,The Mexican species now belong to genus Gyrandra, and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus Schenkia. The new name Zeltnera was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species.Plants of this genus are annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbs. They are taprooted or have fibrous root systems. They produce one or more branching stems which are often ridged and sometimes winged. The leaves are gathered around the lower stem or arranged along the length of the stem. They vary in shape, from linear to lance-shaped to oval, and are green or yellowish. The inflorescence is variable in arrangement. The flower has a tubular throat that opens into a flat corolla with four or five lobes. It may be any shade of pink or white, and the throat is usually paler, to white or yellowish, or occasionally patterned with green. The fruit is a small capsule containing up to 700 minute seeds. Zeltnera and Centaurium species differ mostly in the morphology of the style and stigma, as well as the shape of the fruit capsule.Zeltnera can be subdivided into three groups, a division which is supported by DNA evidence but is most obvious in terms of geography. They are casually named the \"Californian group\", the \"Texan group\", and the \"Mexican group\". The first group is distributed from British Columbia south through the West Coast of the United States and into Baja California. The \"Texan\" plants occur from Arizona to Oklahoma in the US and throughout northern Mexico. The \"Mexican group\" occurs in Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. The range may extend north into Arizona.Genus Zeltnera was named for the Swiss botanists Louis and Nicole Zeltner, who have researched Centaurium and other gentians.Species include:\nZeltnera abramsii\nZeltnera arizonica - Arizona centaury\nZeltnera beyrichii - quinineweed\nZeltnera breviflora\nZeltnera calycosa - Arizona centaury, shortflower centaury, rosita, Buckley centaury\nZeltnera davyi - Davy's centaury\nZeltnera exaltata - desert centaury\nZeltnera gentryi\nZeltnera glandulifera - sticky centaury\nZeltnera madrensis\nZeltnera martinii\nZeltnera maryanna - gypsum centaury\nZeltnera muehlenbergii - Muhlenberg's centaury\nZeltnera multicaulis - manystem centaury\nZeltnera namophila - springloving centaury\nZeltnera nesomii\nZeltnera nevadensis\nZeltnera nudicaulis - Santa Catalina Mountain centaury\nZeltnera pusilla\nZeltnera quitensis - Britton's centaury\nZeltnera setacea\nZeltnera stricta\nZeltnera texensis - Lady Bird's centaury\nZeltnera trichantha - alkali centaury\nZeltnera venusta - charming centaury, canchalagua\nZeltnera wigginsii\nPassage 7:\nPsychotria\nPsychotria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It contains 1,582 species and is therefore one of the largest genera of flowering plants. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.\nMany species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\nSelected species\nFormerly placed here\nPsychotria elata = Palicourea elata\nPsychotria poeppigiana = Palicourea tomentosa\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nList of the largest genera of flowering plants\nPassage 8:\nTibouchina heteromalla\nPleroma heteromallum, synonyms including Tibouchina grandifolia and Tibouchina heteromalla, known by the common name silverleafed princess flower in English, is a species of evergreen flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to French Guiana, Bolivia and Brazil.\n\nDescription\nPleroma heteromallum reaches an average height of 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m), with a maximum of about 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) in its native habitat. The branching stem is woody and the large, silvery green leaves are simple, ovate, velvety in texture, and oppositely arranged. The inflorescence is a panicle of several purple flowers with five petals. The plant has 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) long leaves, with prominent veins that are puffed up in the middle and old leaves will often turn an orange color just prior to dropping off.\n\nCultivation\nThe plant is cultivated as an ornamental for its showy foliage and purple flowers. It is sensitive to cold but can tolerate a light frost.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nAureusvirus\nAureusvirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Tombusviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are six species in this genus.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus contains the following species:\nCucumber leaf spot virus\nElderberry aureusvirus 1\nJohnsongrass chlorotic stripe mosaic virus\nMaize white line mosaic virus\nPothos latent virus\nYam spherical virus\n\nStructure\nViruses in Aureusvirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and  Spherical geometries, and T=3 symmetry. The diameter is around 30 nm. Genomes are linear, around 4.4kb in length.\n\nLife cycle\nViral replication is cytoplasmic, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription, using the premature termination model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, and  suppression of termination. The virus exits the host cell by tubule-guided viral movement. Plants serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are mechanical, seed borne, and contact.\nPassage 10:\nPothoideae\nPothoideae is a subfamily of flowering plants in the family Araceae. The species in the subfamily are true aroids.\n\nTribes and genera\nThe subfamily consists of two tribes:\n\nAnthurieaeAnthurium Schott\n\nPothoeae\nPothos L.\nPedicellarum M.Hotta (monotypic)\nPothoidium Schott (monotypic)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBuddhist atomism\nBuddhist atomism is a school of atomistic Buddhist philosophy that flourished on the Indian subcontinent during two major periods. During the first phase, which began to develop prior to the 6th century CE, Buddhist atomism had a very qualitative, Aristotelian-style atomic theory. This form of atomism identifies four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth.  Like the Hindus and Jains, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their logical presuppositions. \n\nAccording to Noa Ronkin, this kind of atomism was developed in the Sarvastivada and Sautrantika schools for whom material reality can be: reduced to discrete momentary atoms, namely, the four primary elements. These momentary atoms, through their spatial arrangement and by their concatenation with prior and posterior atoms of the same type, create the illusion of persisting things as they appear in our everyday experience. Atomic reality is thus understood first and foremost as change, though not in the sense of a thing x transforming into y. That is, change itself is the very nature of atomic reality rather than its being made of enduring substances the qualities of which undergo change. Atoms that appear to endure are, in fact, a series of momentary events that ascend and fall in rapid succession and in accordance with causal relations. Unlike the atoms of the Vaifesika, the atoms of the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika and the Sautrantika are not permanent: they come into being and cease from one moment to the next going through a process of birth, continuance, decay and destruction. Yet the material compounds that consist of these atoms are real, if only in the minimal, phenomenological sense.The second phase of Buddhist atomism, which flourished in the 7th century CE, was very different from the first. Indian Buddhist philosophers, including Dharmakirti and Dignāga, considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. In discussing Buddhist atomism, Stcherbatsky writes:\n... The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... \"Everything is evanescent,\" ... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff ... Both systems [Sānkhya and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called \"qualities\" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality, ... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna \"quality\", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive ... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas (\"qualities\").\n\nSee also\nAtomism\nDharmakirti\nDignaga\nKalapas\nMereological nihilism\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nLeucippus\nLeucippus (; Greek: Λεύκιππος, Leúkippos; fl. 5th century BCE) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who has been credited as the first philosopher to develop a theory of atomism.\nLeucippus' reputation, even in antiquity, was obscured by the reputation of his much more famous pupil, Democritus, who is also credited with the first development of atomic theory. Few details about Leucippus' life are known, and even his historical existence has on occasion been questioned.\n\nBiography\nLeucippus's dates are not recorded and he is often mentioned in conjunction with his more well-known pupil Democritus. Diogenes Laertius lists possible birthplaces as Miletus, Abdera and Elea. Some sources claim that around 440 or 430 BCE Leucippus founded a school at Abdera, with which his pupil, Democritus, was closely associated. There is mention that a Leucippus founded the city of Metapontum, which honored this Leucippus with a coin.\n\nPhilosophical views\n\"Nothing happens at random, but everything from reason and by necessity.\"\nLeucippus is typically associated with atomism—the idea that the only two things are atoms, which are imperishable, indivisible elements that compose everything, and void, which is the space that atoms do occupy or can occupy. It is difficult to determine which contributions to atomism come from Democritus and which come from Leucippus. Aristotle and his student Theophrastus explicitly credit Leucippus with the invention of atomism. In Aristotelian terms, Leucippus agreed with the Eleatic argument that \"true being does not admit of vacuum\" and there can be no movement in the absence of vacuum. Leucippus contended that since movement exists, there must be empty space. However, he concludes that vacuum is identified with nonbeing, since \"nothing\" cannot really be. According to Aristotle, Leucippus differed from the Eleatics in not being encumbered by the \"conceptual intermingling\" of being and non-being, and Plato made the necessary distinction between \"grades of being and types of negation\".\n\nWritings\nAccording to Theophrastus, Leucippus was the author of a work called The Great World System that was otherwise typically attributed to Democritus, which has not survived. A single quotation survives from another work attributed to him called On Mind.\n\nLegacy\nA brief notice in Diogenes Laërtius's life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in his Corpus Democriteum, Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. The present consensus among the world's historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical. Moreover, it is not clear how to interpret Epicurus' comment in the first place. Epicurus said that there was no philosopher Leucippus, which might mean that Leucippus never existed, but it also might mean that Leucippus existed but was not aing Keynesian monetary theory and policies, an honorary research fellow at the Political Economy Research Centre at City, University of London (CITYPERC), Chair of the  Political Economy Research Centre's Advisory Board at Goldsmiths, a fellow of the New Economics Foundation, a director of  Advocacy International and a trustee of the PREP Foundation for pluralist economics. Pettifor is a member of the Green New  Deal Group of economists, environmentalists and entrepreneurs.\n\nBiography\nLynda Ann Pettifor was born in South Africa in February 1947, and graduated with a degree in politics and economics from the University of the Witwatersrand. In the 1980s she held several posts as adviser to Frances Morrell, the leader of the Inner London Education Authority and later advised  Greater London Council, Ken Livingstone. She also advised the Right Hon. Margaret Beckett MP who went on to serve in the 1997 Labour government. She also worked as a lobbyist for Ian Greer Associates.\nPettifor co-founded the Jubilee 2000 worldwide campaign for the cancellation of the debts of the poorest countries. In 1998 Jubilee 2000 organised a human chain of approximately 70,000 people, which surrounded the 1998 G8 summit in Birmingham, United Kingdom. In 1999 at the Cologne G8 Summit the G8 agreed to write off approximately $100 billion of third world debt owed by 37 countries, in large part due to the campaign. Jubilee 2000 had supporters including Pope John Paul II, Muhammad Ali, Bono, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Bill Clinton. The Independent would later describe her work on the campaign as 'genius'.At the conclusion of the Jubilee 2000 campaign Pettifor joined the New Economics Foundation in London where she headed their research unit on global macro-economics.Pettifor became a member of the Green New  Deal Group of economists, environmentalists and entrepreneurs that published The Green New Deal in July 2008. The group argued that \"The triple crunch of financial meltdown, climate change and ‘peak oil’ has its origins firmly rooted in the current model of globalisation. Financial deregulation has facilitated the creation of almost limitless credit. With this credit boom have come irresponsible and often fraudulent patterns of lending, creating inflated bubbles in assets such as property, and powering environmentally unsustainable consumption.\"\nIn the 2010 general election Pettifor attempted to stand for Parliament as a Labour candidate and was shortlisted in the North West Durham selection process but lost to Pat Glass. She has also unsuccessfully stood as a local election candidate for the West End ward on Westminster City Council.\nAs a director of Advocacy International she worked on designing and promoting the MamaYe campaign together with Options Consultancy Services. Working in five African countries the campaign makes life-saving changes for mothers and babies during pregnancy and childbirth.In September 2015, she was appointed to the British Labour Party's Economic Advisory Committee, convened by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and reporting to Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, regarding which she stated that she was honoured to be asked to serve with such distinguished colleagues and that she hoped to play her part in overturning the Chancellor's deficit fetishism, and his employment of it as a smokescreen for an attack on the state. She currently resides in London, England.\nPettifor contributed an article to the Labour in the City Anthology in October 2018, which was launched at the City Corporation by Alistair Darling. Pettifor argues that far more radical reforms are needed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 crisis.\n\nAwards\nPettifor was granted the freedom of the city of Callao in Peru in 1999 (for her work on debt cancellation for Peru); and the Pax Christi International Peace Award in 2000. In 2001 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Lord Patten, Vice-Chancellor of Newcastle University, and in the same year was honoured with a Masters of Letters Degree (a Lambeth Degree) by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo made her a Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) for her work in leading the campaign to write off billions of dollars of debt owed by Africa's poorest countries. In 2018, she was awarded with the Hannah Arendt Prize.\n\nWorks\nPettifor is known for correctly predicting the global financial crises in several publications including in the book The Real World Economic Outlook, and summarised in the New Statesman in an article published on 1 September 2003 entitled \"Coming soon: The new poor”.

The city's name originated from Florida State Road 860, a major roadway through the area also known as Miami Gardens Drive. \nMiami Gardens had a population of 111,640 as of 2020. It is Florida's most populous city with a majority African American population and also home to the largest percentage of African Americans (66.97 percent) of any city in Florida, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is a principal city within the Miami metropolitan area, the nation's ninth largest and world's 65th largest metropolitan area with a population of 6.158 million people as of 2020. \nMiami Gardens is the home of Hard Rock Stadium, a 64,767 capacity multi-purpose stadium that serves as the home field for both the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League and the Miami Hurricanes, the University of Miami's NCAA Division I college football team, which has won five national championships since 1983.\n\nHistory\nIn the wake of the construction of I-95 in the late 1960s, many middle- and upper-income African American and West Indian American families migrated from Miami neighborhoods like Liberty City to what became Miami Gardens (also called Carol City, Norland or Norwood) as race-based covenants were outlawed with the Fair Housing Act, and mostly lower income blacks moved into the Liberty City and Little Haiti neighborhoods surrounding Liberty Square and Edison Courts.\nMiami Gardens was incorporated on May 13, 2003. The city's neighborhoods of Andover, Bunche Park, Carol City, Lake Lucerne, Norland, Opa-locka North, and Scott Lake were previously unincorporated areas within Miami-Dade County.\nIn 2007, Mayor Shirley Gibson said that the city would no longer allow any low-income housing developments; many residents blamed the developments for spreading crime and recreational drugs throughout the city. Around that time, the city's tax revenues dropped to the third-lowest in Miami-Dade County.In 2012, Oliver Gilbert, only the second mayor the city has had, proposed forming a community redevelopment agency (CRA). CRAs are formed to remove \"slum and blight\", to improve the physical environment of the city and to combat the social and economic problems typical of slum areas. CRAs are funded with property tax increases, which funds are used, in part, to stimulate private investment in the rehabilitation of the community.During the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Hard Rock Stadium will host multiple matches during the tournament.\n\nDemographics\nThe city was incorporated in 2003, but various parts of the city appear as census designated places in the 2000 census and previous censuses. They now make up the neighborhoods of Andover, Bunche Park, Carol City, Lake Lucerne, Norwood, Opa-locka North, and Scott Lake. The United States Census Bureau enumerated that the population of Miami Gardens was 111,640 per the 2020 census.\n\nHispanic population\n2010 Census\nIn 2010, there were 34,284 housing units of which 6.0% were vacant. As of 2016, the age distribution was 5.6% under the age of 5, 6.7% from 5 to 9, 6.5% from 10 to 14, 15.5% from 15 to 24, 14.6% from 25 to 34, 12.7% 35 to 44, 13.1% 45 to 54, 12.6% 55 to 64, and 12.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The population was 46.9% male and 53.1% female. Families made up 72% of households, while 28% were non-families. The average household size was 3.52 members, and the city covered 20 square miles (52 km2).\n\nCrime rates\nAccording to City Rating, Miami Gardens crime statistics have decreased in the past 13 years. The crimes that have decreased the most are property crimes and violent crimes. The crime rate for Miami Gardens for 2018 is expected to be lower than in 2016. Miami Garden's 2016 violent crime rate was 63.64% higher than the national violent crime rate, and the property crime rate was 30.99% higher than the national property crime rate.In 2016, Miami Gardens' violent crime rate was higher than that in Florida by 50.99%, and the property crime rate was 19.49% higher.In 2016, there were 432 reported cases of aggravated assault, 22 reported cases of arson, 509 reported cases of burglary, 24 cases of forcible rape, 2,743 cases of larceny and theft, 419 reported cases of motor vehicle theft, 22 reported cases of murder and manslaughter, and 265 cases of robbery.The projected 2018 crime data is as follows: 286 reported cases of aggravated assault, 26 reported cases of arson, 435 reported cases of burglary, 7 cases reported of forcible rape, 2,139 cases reported of larceny and theft, 205 cases reported of motor vehicle theft, 18 reported cases of murder and manslaughter, and 102 reported cases of robbery.\n\nSports facilities\nThe Calder Race Course opened in 1971.\nMiami Gardens is home to the Miami Dolphins, who play in Hard Rock Stadium on land that was part of the Lake Lucerne CDP. This stadium also hosts the annual Orange Bowl college football game, and is the home field for the University of Miami Hurricanes football team.  The Miami Open tennis tournament is held on the grounds of the stadium. The Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball shared Hard Rock Stadium with the Dolphins for almost two decades until, in 2012, they relocated to Miami and changed their name to the Miami Marlins.\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Miami International Autodrome hosted the Miami Grand Prix for Formula One.\n\nHealthcare\nThe city of Miami Gardens has several health care clinics and facilities that offer medical care and support to its residents. Although the city has no hospital directly within its limits, Jackson North Medical Center, Concentra Urgent Care, and, Chen Medical Center provideof Florida International University in University Park, the Nova Southeastern Sharks of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, and the Barry Buccaneers of Barry University in Miami Shores.\n\nMinor league and other sports\nThe Miami area is also host to minor league sports teams, including:\n\nThe Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals conduct spring training in Jupiter at Roger Dean Stadium.\nThe Houston Astros and Washington Nationals conduct spring training in West Palm Beach at The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches.\nInter Miami CF will have a reserve team that will play in USL League One.\nThe Homestead-Miami Speedway oval has hosted NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series events. Temporary street circuits at Museum Park hosted several CART, IMSA GT, and American Le Mans Series races between from 1986 to 1995, as well as a Formula E race in 2015. The Palm Beach International Raceway is a minor road course.\n\nSee also\nSouth Florida\nUnited States metropolitan area\nTable of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas\nLargest metropolitan areas in the Americas\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nMiami metropolitan area (disambiguation)\nThe Miami metropolitan area is the metropolitan area centered on Miami, Florida.\nThe Miami metropolitan area may also refer to:\n\nThe Miami, Oklahoma micropolitan area, United States\n\nSee also\nMiami (disambiguation)\nPassage 7:\nTidal flooding\nTidal flooding, also known as sunny day flooding or nuisance flooding, is the temporary inundation of low-lying areas, especially streets, during exceptionally high tide events, such as at full and new moons. The highest tides of the year may be known as the king tide, with the month varying by location. These kinds of floods tend not to be a high risk to property or human safety, but further stress coastal infrastructure in low lying areas.This kind of flooding is becoming more common in cities and other human-occupied coastal areas as sea level rise  associated with climate change and other human-related environmental impacts such as coastal erosion and land subsidence increase the vulnerability of infrastructure. Geographies faced with these issues can utilize coastal management practices to mitigate the effects in some areas, but increasingly these kinds of floods may develop into coastal flooding that requires managed retreat or other more extensive climate change adaptation practices are needed for vulnerable areas.\n\nEffects on infrastructure\nTidal flooding is capable of greatly inhibiting natural gravity-based drainage systems in low-lying areas when it reaches levels that are below visible inundation of the surface, but which are high enough to incapacitate the lower drainage or sewer system. Thus, even normal rainfall or storm surge events can cause greatly amplified flooding effects. One passive solution to intrusion through drainage systems are one way back-flow valves in drainage ways. However, while this may prevent a majority of the tidal intrusion, it also inhibits drainage during exceptionally high tides that shut the valves. In Miami Beach, where resilience work is underway, the pump systems replace insufficient gravity-based systems.\n\nRelation to climate change\nSunny day flooding is often associated with coastal regions, where sea level rise attributed to global warming can send water into the streets on days with elevated high tides. Further, regions with glaciers also experience sunny day flooding as climate change alters the dynamics of glacier meltwater. Abnormally hot temperatures not only swell rivers and creeks directly through accelerated snowmelt, but can burst ice dams and cause water from glacial lakes to swell waterways less predictably.A warming climate causes physical changes to the types of ice on a glacier. As glaciers retreat, there is less firn (water-retaining snow) so that more meltwater runs directly into the watershed over deeper, impervious glacial ice.\n\nAffected geographies\nUnited States\nMost of the coastal communities in the Eastern Seaboard of the United States are vulnerable to this kind of flooding as sea level rise increases.Due to changing geography such as subsidence, and poorly planned development, tidal flooding may exist separate from modern nuisance flooding associated with sea level rise and anthropocentric climate change. The widely publicized Holland Island in Maryland for example has disappeared over the years mainly due to subsidence and coastal erosion. In the New Orleans area on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, land subsidence results in the Grand Isle tide gauge showing an extreme upward sea level trend.\n\nFlorida\nIn Florida, controversy arose when state-level government mandated that the term \"nuisance flooding\" and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott. This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century. The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than one meter (3.3 feet).\nIn the Miami metropolitan area, where the vast majority of the land is below 10 ft (3.0 m), even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding. The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about 4 feet (1.2 m) MLLW, 3 feet (0.9 m) above mean sea level, or about 2 ft (0.61 m) NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW. While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about 2 ft (0.61 m), with the greatest range being less than 2 m (6.6 ft), the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation. NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed vertical datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations. During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times 1 foot (0.30 m) or more over datum.\nFort Lauderdale has installed over one hundred tidal valves since 2013 to combat flooding. Fort Lauderdale is nicknamed the \"Venice of America\" due to its roughly 165 miles (266 km) of canals.A recent University of Florida study correlated the increased tidal flooding in south Florida, at least from 2011–2015 to episodic atmospheric conditions. The rate was about 3/4 of an inch (19 mm) per year, versus the global rate of just over a tenth of an inch (3 mm) per year.\n\nSee also\nAcqua alta, tidal peaks in the northern Adriatic Sea which cause flooding in the Venetian Lagoon\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSquadron A Armory\nThe Squadron A Armory is a former United States Army armory and was the home base of Squadron A. It took up the whole block between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue, between 94th and 95th Street. It was therefore also known as the Madison Avenue Armory.  A surviving part of the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Madison Avenue Facade of the Squadron A Armory and is a New York City landmark.\nA stone plaque with the squadron's cry \"Boutez en avant!\", translated variously as \"Press forward!\" or simply \"Charge!\", is located on the wall at Madison Avenue.\n\nHistory\nThe building was built in 1895 by a New York City contractor named John F. Johnson. It was constructed with red bricks, featuring massive walls with towers. It also included about 100 horse stalls to house Squadron A's horses.The building was partially demolished in the 1960s; however, an emergency action from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which designated it a landmark, stopping the demolition of the Madison Avenue facade. That facade was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. When the eastern building was rebuilt, it was done in a style similar to the original.\n\nUsage\nToday, the eastern and central part of the site are used by Hunter College High School and Elementary School as the schools' main campus. The outline of some of the former walls is lined with trees.\n\nSee also\nList of armories and arsenals in New York City and surrounding counties\nSeventh Regiment Armory\nList of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets\nPassage 2:\nMetropolitan Life North Building\nThe Metropolitan Life North Building, now known as Eleven Madison, is a 30-story art deco skyscraper in the Flatiron District adjacent to Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City, at 11-25 Madison Avenue. The building is bordered by East 24th Street, Madison Avenue, East 25th Street and Park Avenue South, and was formerly connected by a sky bridge and tunnel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower just south of it.\nThe North Building was built in three stages on the site of the second Madison Square Presbyterian Church. Construction started in 1929, just before the onset of the Great Depression. Originally planned to be 100 stories, the North Building was never completed as originally planned due to funding problems following the Depression. The current design was constructed in three stages through 1950. As part of the Metropolitan Life Home Office Complex, the North Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 19, 1996.\n\nHistory\nSite\nThe original Madison Square Presbyterian Church, designed by Richard M. Upjohn in the Gothic Revival architectural style, was located on Madison Square Park at the southeast corner of East 24th Street and Madison Avenue, and was completed in 1854. The building was acquired by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and razed to make way for the 50-story Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, which was briefly the world's tallest building. In exchange, the church received a 75-by-150-foot (23 by 46 m) plot of land on the north side of 24th Street that became the site for Stanford White's 1906 building for the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, sometimes called the \"Parkhurst Church\" after Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst.A plot on the north side of 24th Street, measuring 75 by 100 feet (23 by 30 m), was developed in 1903 as the first Metropolitan Annex, a 16-story printing plant building faced in Tuckahoe marble. The annex was designed by LeBrun, and it was connected to the main building by a tunnel. Upjohn's building was demolished in 1919 to make way for an expansion of that annex. The structure was to be 18 stories tall with six elevators, and would incorporate the existing annex, which would be 75 by 225 feet (23 by 69 m). The ground story of the new annex would contain an auditorium with 1,100-seats, and the 12th story would include a lunchroom and a sky bridge to the 11th story of the home office building across 24th Street. This annex was designed by D. Everett Waid and completed in 1921.\n\nConstruction\nThe North Building was designed in the 1920s by Harvey Wiley Corbett and D. Everett Waid and built in three stages. Metropolitan Life had acquired the lot bounded by Madison Avenue, 24th Street, Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South), and 25th Street in September 1929. Preliminary plans, submitted that October, proposed a 35-story building that would serve as a new \"home office\", supplanting the old \"home office\" in the Metropolitan Life Tower directly to the south. The final design for the new building, presented in November 1929, called for a 100-story tower with several setbacks, which would have been the tallest building in the world. The structure would accommodate 30,000 daily visitors when completed, and would have escalators connecting the lowest 13 stories.Following the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression, Corbett and Waid resubmitted plans for the building in November 1930. The new plans called for a 28-story brick, granite, and limestone structure. Starrett Brothers & Eken were selected as contractors the following month. Initially, only the eastern half of the block was developed; that structure was finished in 1932. Upon the first stage's completion, Corbett said, \"it is a highly specialized building designed primarily as a machine to do as efficiently as possible the particular headquarters' work of our largest insurance company\". The new structure contained 22 acres (8.9 ha) of new office space. The original 16-story Metropolitan Life annex, at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 24th Street, remained in place.In 1937, four buildings on Madison Avenue between 24th and 25th Street, ranging in height from 12 to 20 stories, were demolished to make way for the second phase of construction: the northwestern portion of the 28-story structure. In 1938, the company filed plans to build the western half of the 28-story building at a cost of $10 million. The western wall of the existing structure would be demolished so the two sections would be integrated into a single building. The second phase was finished in 1940 and contained 32 stories: 28 above-ground and four basement levels, the same as in the first phase.LeBrun's and Waid's northern annexes were demolished in 1946 to make way for themillion. Following this purchase, RSA owned an 88 percent stake in the building, and there was $60 million on hand to pay for renovations. At the time, the building was 65 percent occupied.RSA created a subsidiary, the New Water Street Corporation, to operate and manage the building. The new owners immediately appointed Jones Lang Wootton as the building's leasing agent. After acquiring the building, RSA planned to remove asbestos, upgrade the elevators, and add sprinklers to each floor. RSA hired Kohn Pedersen Fox to design cosmetic remodeling plans, and the pension fund spent over $20 million to remove asbestos from the building and install a back-up electrical system. The cost of renovations had increased to $125 million or $140 million by the mid-1990s. The building still had large amounts of vacant office space at the time, despite offering relatively low rents of around $20/sq ft ($220/m2). During this time, major tenants at 55 Water Street included the Depository Trust Company and the Securities Industry Automation Corporation.In the years after RSA acquired the building, annual income frequently increased by more than 10 percent from year to year. RSA upgraded 55 Water Street's communication and electrical systems to attract tenants, advertising the building as the \"Tower of Power\". Much of the office space had been filled by 1997, when Standard & Poor's leased 937,000 sq ft (87,100 m2). In addition, several other financial firms such as Royal Bank of Canada and Goldman Sachs had expressed interest leasing space in the building. The renovation of 55 Water Street was completed in 1999 at a cost of $156 million. At that point, the building was 100 percent occupied. About a third of the space was still occupied by Chemical Bank successor Chase Bank, whose lease expired in 2003; the bank planned to move out after its lease expired. Additionally, the owners were planning a renovation for the building's elevated plaza, as well as the public space next to Vietnam Veterans Plaza, both of which were underused.\n\n2000s\nIn early 2001, Goldman Sachs considered constructing a 13-story, 240 ft (73 m) annex on the site of the Elevated Acre. The annex would have included seven large trading floors, each covering 56,000 sq ft (5,200 m2). In addition, the height of the north tower would have been increased by 35 ft (11 m). The entire project would have cost $850 million and would have been completed in 2004. To compensate for the loss of public space, Goldman Sachs proposed paying for various improvements of public space nearby. The plans were dropped shortly after they were presented. Goldman Sachs cited economic conditions, but some neighborhood residents had expressed opposition to the plan. Following the cancellation of Goldman Sach's plans, RSA hired Mary Ann Tighe as the building's broker. RSA and the Municipal Art Society sponsored a design competition for a renovation of the elevated plaza. In September 2002, RSA hired a joint venture of Ken Smith and Rogers Marvel Architects to redesign the plaza.Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the building's managers implemented security checkpoints in the lobby, resulting in rent increases for all tenants. To fill the empty space, the owners offered two years of free rent to new tenants. HIP Health Plan of New York (later part of EmblemHealth) leased the entire north building and part of the south building in 2003. At the time, it was the largest corporate relocation to Lower Manhattan since the September 11 attacks. Simultaneously, the Teachers' Retirement System of New York City also rented 150,000 sq ft (14,000 m2) at the building. The Elevated Acre plaza was rededicated in 2005 following a renovation. The New York City Department of Transportation leased more than 400,000 sq ft (37,000 m2) in 2006, and publishing company Bowne & Co. also leased space.\n\n2010s to present\nDuring the early 21st century, CBRE Group became the leasing agent. On October 29, 2012, the building sustained damage related to Hurricane Sandy when a 14-foot-high (4.3 m) storm surge flooded the area. The basement levels were severely damaged, and the emergency generators on the roof could not operate because they were powered by pumps in the basement. The building remained closed for several weeks due to flooding. While repairs were being conducted, a fire broke out on November 23, causing injuries to 27 people. To prepare for future storms, the building's owner planned to relocate electrical equipment from the basement to the third floor. In 2014, Plaza Construction installed a flood barrier system around the building; when activated, the flood walls could protect against an 8 ft (2.4 m) surge.McGraw Hill Financial moved its headquarters to 55 Water Street in June 2015, and Hugo Boss moved its North American headquarters there the same year. By 2018, RSA earned $155 million in rental income annually, and the building was worth an estimated $1.5 billion. In 2019, software company Justworks announced it would be moving into 270,000 sq ft (25,000 m2) on four floors, and the Teachers' Retirement System of New York City subleased a portion of one floor. MJHS Health System leased 138,000 sq ft (12,800 m2) in March 2022, the largest lease to be finalized in lower Manhattan in 18 months.\n\nReception\nWhen the building was completed, architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable called the building \"a significant demonstration of how to stop worrying and love the boom\" in office development. Huxtable also wrote that the building's elevated plaza was \"a skillful job in urban design\". By contrast, in 1981, Paul Goldberger described 55 Water Street, along with many skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, as having been \"designed by commercial architectural firms which admitted to few interests beyond the quick and efficient creation of rentable space\". According to Goldberger, these types of buildings used common materials such as concrete and glass, creating edifices that \"added little either visually or socially to the life of the city\". The AIA Guide to New York City described the north building as resembling \"a complicated cell phone tower\". In addition, the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains a 36-story replica of 55 Water Street.\n\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMan and the Moon\n\"Man and the Moon\" is an episode of Disneyland, which originally aired on December 28, 1955. It was directed by Disney animator Ward Kimball.\nThe show begins with a humorous look with a man's fascination with the Moon through animation. This segment features characteristics of the Moon depicted from William Shakespeare and children's nursery rhymes to lunar superstitions and scientific research. Then Kimball comes on with some information on the Moon, supplemented by graphics. Kimball then introduces Dr. Wernher von Braun, who discusses plans for a trip around the Moon. Dr. Wernher von Braun was employed as a technical consultant on this film by Walt Disney, and on a number of other Disney films. He had a great knowledge of rockets, as he had helped to develop the V-2 rocket while working for Nazi Germany.\nFinally, a live action simulation from inside and outside the crewed ship Lunar Recon Ship RM-1 dramatizes what such an expedition might be like, including an almost-disastrous hit by a very small meteor. Towards the end, this film presents what seems to be a bit of \"sci-fi\"; as the RM-1, crossing the Moon's night side, approaches the night/day terminator, high radiation is suddenly detected, and a flare fired over the area reveals what looks like a rectangular double wall, or the ruins thereof, extending out from a crater; strangely, none of the crew remark on it, and the unusual radiation is never mentioned again.  This episode later reaired in 1959 under a new title: \"Tomorrow the Moon\".\nThis episode was preceded by \"Man in Space\" and followed by \"Mars and Beyond\". It was repeated on June 13, 1956, and September 25, 1959.\n\nHome media\nThe episode was released on May 18, 2004, on Walt Disney Treasures: Tomorrow Land.\n\nSee also\n\"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\"\n\"Our Friend the Atom\"\nPassage 2:\nVon Braun (crater)\nvon Braun, named after the rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun, is a lunar impact crater located near the northwestern limb of the Moon. It lies along the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum, to the northeast of the crater Lavoisier. The northeastern rim of this crater is on the edge of the Sinus Roris, a bay feature in the northwestern part of the Oceanus Procellarum. Due to its proximity to the limb, this crater appears significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth.This crater is somewhat distorted from a true circular shape, and is slightly longer to the north and south. The outer rim has undergone some erosion due to subsequent impacts. Most notably, the crater Lavoisier E is attached to the western rim, and the outer rampart falls across part of the inner wall of von Braun. There are small craters along the rim to the southeast and the east, and craterlets along the northeast and southwestern rims. The inner wall has slumped along the southeast and northwestern sides to form a terrace-like shelf. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with a few small craterlets marking the surface.This crater was previously identified as Lavoisier D before being assigned a name by the IAU.\n\nExternal links\nGoogle Moon - von Braun\nPassage 3:\nWalter Dornberger\nMajor-General Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger (6 September 1895 – 26 June 1980) was a German Army artillery officer whose career spanned World War I and World War II. He was a leader of Nazi Germany's V-2 rocket programme and other projects at the Peenemünde Army Research Centre.\nDornberger was born in Gießen in 1895. In 1914 he enlisted in the German army during World War 1.  In October 1918, as an artillery lieutenant, Dornberger was captured by United States Marines and spent two years in a French prisoner of war camp, mostly in solitary confinement because of repeated escape attempts.  In the late 1920s, Dornberger completed an engineering course with distinction at the Berlin Technical Institute, and in the Spring of 1930, Dornberger graduated after five years with an MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg in Berlin.  In 1935, Dornberger received an honorary doctorate, which Col. Karl Emil Becker arranged as Dean of the new Faculty of Military Technology at the TH Berlin.\n\nRocket development\nIn April 1930, Dornberger was appointed to the Ballistics Council of the German Army (Reichswehr) Weapons Department as Assistant Examiner to secretly develop a military liquid-fuel rocket suitable for mass-production that would surpass the range of artillery.  In the spring of 1932, Dornberger, his commander (Captain Ritter von Horstig), and Col. Karl Emil Becker visited the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR)'s leased Raketenflugplatz (English: \"Rocket Flight Field\") and subsequently issued a contract for a demonstration launch.  On 21 December 1932, Captain Dornberger watched a rocket motor explode at Kummersdorf while Wernher von Braun tried to light it with a flaming gasoline can at the end of a four-meter-long (13 ft) pole.In 1933, Waffenamt Prüfwesen (Wa Prüf, English: \"Weapons Testing\") 1/1, under the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Department), commenced work under the direction of Colonel Ing. h. c. Dornberger. Dornberger also took over his last military command on 1 October 1934, a powder-rocket training battery at Königsbrück.  In May 1937, Dornberger and his ninety-man organization were transferred from Kummersdorf to Peenemünde.  In September 1942, Dornberger was given two posts:  coordinating the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket development programs and directing active operations.  The first successful test launch of a V-2 was the third test launch on 3 October 1942. \n\nIn June 1943, in a speech to nearly 6500 German employees and soldiers in Peenemünde, Dornberger blended traditional German patriotism with Nazi ideological motifs while also highlighting and reinforcing many of the unique factors that made missile development so successful at Peenemünde in the first place. By emphasizing the path-breaking nature of their work as well as its singular importance to the war effort, all while playing on the popular fear of the Soviet Union and the disdain for the Western Allies for bombing their cities into rubble, Dornberger composed a powerful message that would certainly appeal to many Peenemünders.In the early morning of 7 July 1943, Ernst Steinhoff flew von Braun and Major-General Dornberger in his Heinkel He 111 to Hitler's Führerhauptquartier \"Wolfsschanze\" headquarters and the nextatican City on consular duty. Though a Nazi party member like his brothers, he avoided direct complicity with regime atrocities such as slave labor and was able to join the new West German foreign service after the war. He rose to become a notable diplomat for West Germany during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSurrender at Reutte\nAfter evacuating from Nordhausen, Magnus von Braun was at the Behelfsheim in Weilheim when Wernher von Braun arrived there from Oberammergau on 14 April 1945.  The next day, Magnus had arrived at the Haus Ingeborg in Oberjoch by the end of the day. When Huzel became von Braun's assistant, Dr. Kurt Debus became Engineer in Charge of Test Stand VII—Huzel had served since May 1944 after replacing his old friend Hartmut Kuechen. The Mittelwerk was designated for production after the 17 August 1943 Operation Hydra bombing of Peenemünde, and production started well afterward, so Magnus von Braun's claim that he was selected to transfer in October 1943 is inaccurate.  After hearing the radio report of Hitler's death, Wernher von Braun announced to his group early in the morning of 3 May 1945 that \"Magnus, who speaks English, has just left by bicycle to establish contact with the American forces at Reutte.  We cannot wait here forever.\"  \"It was quite courageous for Magnus to come down on his bicycle and find the American troops,\" said Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger,  member of the V-2 team. \"He had a white handkerchief tied to the handlebars of the bicycle and that was all he had to protect him.\"\nOn May 10, 1919, I was born in Greifswald, the son of a government administrator, Magnus Freiherr von Braun, and his wife, Emmy, née von Quistorp. I spent my youth in Berlin, where I attended the Prep School and the French School until Easter 1934.  Finally, I went to the Hermann Lietz School in Spiekeroog, North Sea, a boarding school from which I graduated Easter 1937.  After having spent six months in the Arbeitsdienst, I began studies at the Technical Institute of Munich in the fall of 1937, majoring in organic chemistry.  Then when I received my master's degree, I became the assistant in organic chemistry to Professor Hans Fischer (Nobel Prize winner in chemistry) for ¼ year, at which time I was drafted into the Air Force (October 1940).  After the completion of flight training and a short stay as a flight instructor, I came to the Heimat Artillery Park II, Kalshagen, in July 1943.  In Karlshagen, I worked with Mr. Gerhard Heller, the director of fuel chemistry, who put me in charge of hypergolic fuels for the newly developing Wasserfall Project.  In this capacity, I worked in conjunction with the I. G. Farben Industry.  In October 1943, my brother, Professor Wernher von Braun, requested me to work as his personal assistant.\nAbout two in the afternoon, Magnus returned, \"I think it went well, I have safe conduct passes and they want us for further interrogation.\" The Mission Accomplished: The Battle History of the 44th Infantry Division claim that there was a \"hectic night of interrogation, plans and counter-proposals\" after Magnus von Braun rode his bike downhill in the morning and met members of the \"Anti-tank Company, 324th Infantry\" \"before he went out and in a short time returned with his brother\" is inaccurate: Huzel, McGovern, & Ordway, in their researched works, distinctly state Magnus returned about 2 in the afternoon the same day.Dieter Huzel described the surrender of the group: \"Thus, in the dull, rainy, late afternoon of Wednesday, May 2, 1945, seven men [Magnus & Wernher, Walter Dornberger, Axster, Huzel, Lindenberg, & Tessman] ... began their lonely descent from Adolf Hitler Pass toward ... Schattwald. ... Suddenly, around a curve, an American soldier ... waved us to a stop.  Magnus got out and showed a piece of paper to the guard ... After about a half an hour, ... we were flanked by two ...\"jeeps,\"... We reached Reutte after dark.  ... The next morning ... we emerged from the mess hall ... several Army photographers were on hand and spent some time taking pictures.\" During a photo shoot the next day, Magnus von Braun commented \"We're celebrating now, but I'll bet they will throw telephone books at us if we ever reach New York.  By noon, Magnus von Braun (along with Axster, Huzel, Lindenberg, & Tessman) arrived in Peiting where forty other Peenemünde personnel already had arrived, and the Germans departed for Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 8 May.\n\nOperation Paperclip and work at Fort Bliss\nVon Braun arrived in New York on 16 November 1945 aboard the SS Argentina and was soon at work at Fort Bliss, Texas and later at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.  Von Braun was interrogated as a witness for the Andrae war crimes trial in which Mittelwerk general manager Georg Rickhey was acquitted.  Fort Bliss Army CIC agents believed he was a \"dangerous German Nazi\", with one agent remarking, \"his type is a worse threat to security than a half a dozen discredited SS Generals.\" Soon after his arrival, he was caught trying to sell a brick of platinum he'd stolen from the base to a jeweler in El Paso. The incident was quickly hushed up, though he was informally punished by means of a terrible beating given by his brother Wernher the politician.\n\nCareer with Chrysler\nIn 1955, von Braun began a career with Chrysler—first in the missile division and then in the automotive division. He also resided in Huntsville, Alabama, for a while before moving to Michigan.  After living in Michigan, he relocated to the UK, working in London and Coventry as Chrysler UK export director.  Von Braun retired from Chrysler in 1975 and returned to the States, where he settled in Arizona and resided until his death.\nPassage 10:\nVon Braun Ferry Rocket\nVon Braun Ferry Rocket was a concept design for a shuttle spacecraft that was developed by Wernher von Braun in a seminal series of early-1950s Collier's magazine articles, \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\" by Wernher von Braun et al.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJustin Harper (American football)\nJustin Harper (born February 24, 1985) is an American college football coach and former professional Canadian football wide receiver. He is currently the tight ends coach at Old Dominion University. Before this, he served as the interim head coach at Virginia State University and was the wide receivers coach at Towson University in Towson, Maryland. His last professional stint was as a member of the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at Virginia Tech.\n\nEarly years\nHarper played football at Bandys High School, where he led his team to the state championship game as a senior, playing both wide receiver and defensive back.  He was recruited by Winthrop University to play basketball, but decided late in his senior season to try to become a Division I football player.  After graduating, he attended Hargrave Military Academy.  He then was recruited by Virginia Tech.\n\nCollege career\nHarper appeared in 51 games during his four-year career at Virginia Tech, finishing with 83 catches for 1,338 yards, a 16.1 per-catch average, and nine touchdowns.  Harper's best game probably came in his final collegiate contest when he caught four passes for 64 yards (including a 20-yard touchdown), and scored on an 84-yard punt return in the 2008 Orange Bowl against the University of Kansas.\nAs a senior in 2007, Harper played wide receiver alongside Eddie Royal and Josh Morgan and recorded career highs with 41 catches, 635 receiving yards and five touchdown receptions.  Together, Harper, Royal and Morgan combined for 120 catches during their final season at Virginia Tech.  As a junior in 2006, Harper finished fourth on the team in receptions with 21 catches for 324 yards and one touchdown.   During his sophomore season, he posted 16 catches for 295 yards and one touchdown, which came in the Hokies' 35-24 Gator Bowl victory over Louisville.  As a freshman in 2004, he caught five passes for 84 yards and a touchdown.\n\nProfessional career\nNFL\nHarper was drafted in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens. He would continue as a member of the Ravens for the next three seasons only receiving limited playing time during the preseason. Justin Harper was released prior to the start of the 2011 NFL season.\n\nCFL\nOn March 13, 2012 the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League announced that they had signed Harper to a contract.\nOn January 24, 2013 Harper was traded to the BC Lions along with Saskatchewan's third round pick in the 2014 CFL Draft in exchange for slotback Geroy Simon.  On May 24, 2013, a 3 days after the Lions signed Emmanuel Arceneaux, Harper was released.\nPassage 2:\nColorado Buffaloes football\nThe Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level. The team is a member of the Pac-12 Conference, having previously been a charter member of the Big 12 Conference. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.  The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship.  The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage.\n\nHistory\nBeginning in 1890, Colorado football has enjoyed much success throughout its more than 135 years of competitive play.\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in numerous bowl games (28 appearances in bowl games (12–16), 36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990.Folsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game.  The game on September 12, 2015, against Massachusetts was the school's 1,200th football game.\n\nConference affiliations\nIndependent (1890–1892, 1905)\nColorado Football Association (1893–1904, 1906–1908)\nColorado Faculty Athletic Conference (1909)\nRocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference (1910–1937)\nMountain States Conference (1938–1947)\nBig Eight Conference (1948–1995)\nBig 12 Conference (1996–2010)\nPac-12 Conference (2011–present)\n\nChampionships\nNational championships\nColorado won one national championship in football for 1990.: 120 \n1990 season\nColorado won the national championship in 1990 under the direction of head coach Bill McCartney, who helmed the team from 1982 to 1994. While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls.  Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster. Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.\n\nConference championships\nColorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences) All-SEC second team as a halfback.\n\n1934\nOne of Mickal's most notable games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two touchdown passes, the first one a 32-yarder to tie the game at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass down the middle of the field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.\n\nSenatorship offer\nDuring the season, Mickal was acclaimed an honorary Louisiana State Senator by U.S. Senator Huey P. Long, whom he had befriended, at a burlesque campus meeting. Long was a noted LSU supporter and was highly involved in operations of the football program. When it came time for his ceremonial \"seating\" Mickal refused to appear for the ceremony, despite the urging of Long. After Long reasoned with the senate and spectators that Mickal \"had to study,\" Mickal was granted a five-day leave of absence by senator Harvey Peltier to \"do his work at school and go forward with his preparation for his football duties.\" Mickal remained silent on the matter, however; he did not give a reason for his refusal of the honor. The day he was to be inducted, Mickal said in a telegram to Long that if he accepted the senatorship he would introduce a joint resolution that made it \"unlawful\" for any Tulane player to cross the LSU goal line in 1934.\n\n1935\nMickal had a slow start to 1935 while he recovered from a broken ankle he suffered over the summer. In week three, he threw two touchdown passes against Manhattan College, and a game-winning touchdown pass against Vanderbilt two weeks later. In the regular season finale, Mickal was responsible for three touchdowns in a 41–0 win over rival Tulane. LSU faced the TCU Horned Frogs at the end of the season in the Sugar Bowl, in a game that was a highly anticipated match-up between Mickal and the Horned Frogs' Sammy Baugh. The offenses were unable to do much, however, as rain throughout the day had muddied the field. TCU won the game, 3–2. LSU finished the season undefeated in conference play for its first SEC championship. Mickal was named to the AP All-SEC second-team as a fullback after the season, and earned second-team All-America honors from Liberty magazine.\n\n1936 All-Stars vs. Bears\nIn September 1936, Mickal played quarterback for the Centennial College All-Stars, a team composed of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive into the end zone from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. \"A lot of things flashed through my mind,\" explained Mickal. \"There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought about going to med school. I thought about possible brain damage.\" He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.\n\nExtracurricular\nMickal was actively involved in the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps. He received the Outstanding Cadet Award as a freshman and was regimental sergeant major as a junior. As a senior, he attained the rank of Cadet Colonel and earned the Kemper Williams Sabre as the school's outstanding cadet. Additionally, he was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and in 1936 was president of the school's Interfraternity Council, college of arts and sciences, and student body. Mickal was a member of the Theta Kappa Nu fraternity.\n\nMedical career\nMickal was the first player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, selected in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in obstetrics and gynecology at New Orleans Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in until his retirement in 1980. He was a founding member of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center.\n\nHonors\nMickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1967, the National Football Foundation named Mickal to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1969 and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. Mickal was named LSU's \"Alumnus of the Year\" in 1980 and its \"Medical Alumnus of the Year\" in 1985. \"It's been a beautiful marriage—and I've had all the better of it,\" said Mickal of his involvement with the university. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists gave Mickal its Distinguished Service Award in 1991.\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

A shaft is supported by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that no contact occurs. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure, which is generated by the rotation that pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. The high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.\n\nDevelopment\nFoil bearings were first developed in the late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the Garrett Corporation using independent R&D funds to serve military and space applications. They were first tested for commercial use in United Airlines Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early and mid-1960s. Garrett AiResearch air cycle machine foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the DC-10's environmental control systems. Garrett AiResearch foil bearings were installed on all US military aircraft to replace existing oil-lubricated rolling-contact bearings.  The ability to operate at cryogenic gas temperatures and at very high temperatures gave foil bearings many other potential applications.Current-generation foil bearings with advanced coatings have greatly exceeded the limitations of earlier designs. Antiwear coatings exist that allow over 100,000 start/stop cycles for typical applications.\n\nApplications\nTurbomachinery is the most common application because foil bearings operate at high speed. \nCommercial applications in production include microturbines, fuel cell blowers, and air cycle machines.  The main advantage of foil bearings is the elimination of the oil systems required by traditional bearing designs. Other advantages are:\n\nHigher efficiency, due to a lower heat loss to friction; instead of fluid friction, the main source of heat is parasitic drag\nIncreased reliability\nHigher speed capability\nQuieter operation\nWider operating temperature range (40–2,500 K)\nHigh vibration and shock load capacity\nNo scheduled maintenance\nNo external support system\nTruly oil free where contamination is an issue\nCapable of operating above critical speedAreas of current research are:\n\nHigher load capacity\nImproved damping\nImproved coatingsThe main disadvantages are:\n\nLower capacity than roller or oil bearings\nWear during start-up and stopping\nHigh speed required for operation\n\nSee also\nFluid bearing – Type of bearings which use pressurized liquid or gas between the bearing surfaces\nTribology – Science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion\nPassage 3:\nGordon Burns (footballer)\nGordon Burns (born 2 December 1978) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played in the Scottish First Division for Ayr United.\n\nPlaying career\nBurns began his footballing career with local boys club Troon Thistle, and also spent time playing with Prestwick Boys Club & Coylton Boys Club, before joining Ayr United Boys Club. He was scouted by several senior teams and trained with Motherwell, Dundee United, Hearts and Celtic before deciding to sign 'S' forms with Ayr United under Manager George Burley. He left Marr College at 16 to sign a 2-year YTS contract at Somerset Park with Manager Simon Stainrod, before signing his first professional contract at Ayr United at the age of 18.\n\nAyr United\n\"Burnsie\" began his professional career with his local senior club Ayr United in July 1995 and made an early impact when he made his first team debut at the age of 17 against Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park.

He was the host of The Krypton Factor for its original 18-year run (1977–1995) and was the chief anchorman for the BBC regional news programme North West Tonight from January 1997 to October 2011. In November 2011, Burns moved back to Belfast where he was born.\nDue to his work commitments with Granada Television on programmes such as World in Action and Granada Reports and later BBC Manchester for North West Tonight, he resided in Manchester for over thirty years. Burns most recently hosted a Sunday morning radio show for BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nEncounter with Werther\nEncounter with Werther (German: Begegnung mit Werther) is a 1949 West German historical drama film directed by Karl-Heinz Stroux and starring Horst Caspar, Heidemarie Hatheyer and Paul Klinger. It is based on the writing of the 1774 novel The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It was released to commemorate the writer's second hundredth birthday in August 1949.\nIt was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich and on location in Limburg, Wetzlar and Marburg an der Lahn.\nThe film's sets were designed by the art director Paul Markwitz.\n\nCast\nHorst Caspar as Werther\nHeidemarie Hatheyer as Lotte\nPaul Klinger as Albert\nRudolf Reiff as Amtmann as Lotte's Father\nPaul Dahlke as Napoleon\nWalter Kottenkamp as Goethe\nFritz Odemar as Graf\nHarald Mannl as Gesandter\nChristiane Felsmann as Frl. von Bassenheim\nArthur Mentz as Bauernbursche\nFriedrich Siemers as Schreiber Heinrich\nKarl Lieffen as Bediensteter Bursche\nPassage 2:\nPiano Quartet No. 3 (Brahms)\nThe Piano Quartet No. 3 in C minor, Op. 60, completed by Johannes Brahms in 1875, is scored for piano, violin, viola and cello. It is sometimes called the Werther Quartet after Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. The premiere took place in Vienna on November 18th 1875 to an anxious public. Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima were in attendance.\n\nStructure\nThe quartet is in four movements:\n\nAnalysis\nFirst movement\nThe first movement is a sonata-form movement in C minor in triple meter. It begins with the piano playing bare octaves on C. The violin, viola, and violoncello then play the first theme, consisting of two sighing gestures of a descending minor second, followed by a descending theme. Some have speculated that the sighing motive is a musical utterance of the name \"Clara\", in reference to Clara Schumann, the composer, pianist, and lifelong friend and love interest of Brahms. More clear is Brahms's transposed version of Robert Schumann's \"Clara theme\", found in various pieces such as his Bunte Blätter, Op. 99 (1841), on which both Clara and Brahms wrote sets of piano variations. The Clara theme (C–B–A–G♯–A, often transposed: here E♭–D–C–B–C) was first detected by Eric Sams in his essays and books on Schumann and Brahms. In his 1971 essay “Brahms and his Clara Themes”, Sams writes on the “Clara content” in op. 60: “The first sentence of that autobiographical work is doubly expressive of Clara. Furthermore, there is direct evidence that this melodic form actually embodied her, for Brahms as for Schumann.”After the first statement of the theme, the piano plays octaves on B♭. The opening motives, again played by the strings, becomes more chromatic and unsettling, until finally coming to rest on the dominant of C, G major. The viola and violin play pizzicato octaves on E♮ before the strings cascade down the C harmonic minor scale that ushers in the first theme, stated forte. After a brief development of this theme, an ascending gesture based on sixteenth-notes alternating between the notes of a minor second serves as the transition to the second theme in the relative major of C minor, E♭ major. This second theme is an uplifting eight-measure theme stated initially in the piano alone. Brahms then uses the technique of theme and variations to construct four variations on this theme, each eight measures long. A short idea based on the opening theme closes the exposition, which is not repeated.\nThe development section begins by restating the theme from measures 32–35 in E♭ minor. This moves to B major for a new fortissimo idea (perhaps a variation) based on the same theme. The quartet's opening sighing motives become developed in an E minor passage that incorporates a triplet figure on the second beat of the measure, and eventually the previous B major idea is restated identically in G major. The second theme from the exposition is then treated in imitative (almost canonic) counterpoint in C minor. After the beginning of the third contrapuntal treatment of this theme, a dominant pedal is sustained in octaves on G. This resolves unexpectedly to an A♭ major chord that is quickly brought down to C minor by the opening sighing motive in the piano.\nThe sighing motive indicates the beginning of the recapitulation. Rather than affirming the tonic of C minor, however, Brahms takes the recapitulation in a different direction: the opening section again ends on a dominant pedal on G with the violin and viola playing pizzicato octaves on E♮, but the E♮ is used to turn the music to E minor. Chromatic descent is employed to bring the music to a half-cadence on D, leading to the second theme in G major. This is perhaps the only sonata form movement in the minor mode in which the recapitulation features the second subject in the key of the major dominant. The second theme is first stated by the viola, which is then followed by three new variations (the first being played by the violin, the second and third by the piano), and one of the same variations as the exposition. A fifth variation leads to a short digression in C major but becomes chromatic and ends with a development the first theme, coming to a cadence on C. This is followed by a brief coda that expands on the first motives heard in the piece. Nevertheless, the key of C minor is arguably not clearly established by the recapitulation (the key signature of C minor is present at the end of the movement for less than two complete pages). The movement ends with a clear tonic–dominant–tonic perfect cadence, stated piano. The expansive and exploratory nature of the movement, along with the quiet closing dynamic, helps make the conventional final cadential progression appear mysterious.\n\nSecond movement\nThe second movement is a tempestuous scherzo (ternary form) in compound duple meter in C minor, the same key as the first movement. Donald Francis Tovey argues that Brahms puts the scherzo in the same key as the first movement because the first movement does not sufficiently stabilize its own tonic and requires the second movement to \"[furnish] the tonal balance unprovided for by the end of the first movement.\" Although it is the shortest scherzo of Brahms's piano quartets, it is formally and tonally very complex.\nThe movement begins with an opening motif of a descending octave on G and a rising minor second to A♭ stated by the piano, followed by a falling diatonic line accompanied by the strings. The first theme, which clearly derives from the opening motif, is immediately by the solo piano played after this and Brahms uses the technique of developing variation to expand this theme. Most melodic ideas can be traced to the opening motif or the ascendingand Jean de Reszke in the title role.\nWerther is still regularly performed around the world and has been recorded many times. Although the role of Werther was written for a tenor, Massenet adjusted it for a baritone, when Mattia Battistini sang it in Saint Petersburg in 1902. It is very occasionally performed in this version, in which the changes affect only the vocal line for the title character. There are no other changes to the words, to the lines for other characters, or to the orchestration.\n\nRoles\nInstrumentation\n2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo),\n2 oboes (doubling English horns),\n2 clarinets in B-flat and A,\nalto saxophone,\n2 bassoons,\n4 horns in F,\n2 cornets in B-flat and A,\n3 trombones,\ntuba,\ntimpani,\npercussion (1) (bass drum, triangle),\nharp,\nstrings.\n\nSynopsis\nTime: Within the period July to December, in an undefined year in the 1780s.\nPlace: Wetzlar in Germany.\n\nAct 1\nIn July, the widowed Bailiff (a Magistrate, rather than one who comes to seize property), is teaching his six youngest children a Christmas carol (\"Noël! Jésus vient de naître\"). His drinking companions, Johann and Schmidt, arrive as Charlotte, the eldest daughter, dresses for a ball. Since her fiancé Albert is away, she is to be escorted by Werther, whom the Bailiff and his companions find gloomy. Werther arrives (\"O Nature, pleine de grâce\"), and watches as Charlotte prepares her young siblings' supper, just as her mother had before she died. He greets her and they leave for the ball. Albert returns unexpectedly after a six-month trip. He is unsure of Charlotte's intentions and disappointed not to find her at home, but is reassured and consoled by Charlotte's younger sister Sophie. He leaves after promising to return in the morning. After an orchestral interlude, Werther and Charlotte return very late; he is already enamoured of her. His declaration of love is interrupted by the announcement of Albert's return. Charlotte recalls how she promised her dying mother she would marry Albert. Werther is in despair.\n\nAct 2\nIt is three months later, and Charlotte and Albert are now married. They walk happily to church to celebrate the minister's 50th wedding anniversary, followed by the disconsolate Werther (\"Un autre est son époux!\"). First Albert and then Sophie (\"Du gai soleil, plein de flamme\") try to cheer him up. When Charlotte exits the church, he speaks to her of their first meeting. Charlotte begs Werther to leave her, though she indicates that she would be willing to receive him again on Christmas Day. Werther contemplates suicide (\"Lorsque l'enfant revient d'un voyage\"). He encounters Sophie but the tearful girl does not understand his distressing behavior. Albert now realizes that Werther loves Charlotte.\n\nAct 3\nCharlotte is at home alone on Christmas Eve. She spends time rereading the letters that she has received from Werther (\"Werther! Qui m'aurait dit ... Ces lettres!\"), wondering how the young poet is and how she had the strength to send him away. Sophie comes in and tries to cheer up her older sister (\"Ah! le rire est béni\"), though Charlotte is not to be consoled (\"Va! laisse couler mes larmes\"). Suddenly Werther appears, and while he reads to her some poetry of Ossian (\"Pourquoi me réveiller?\"), he realizes that she does indeed return his love. They embrace for a moment, but she quickly bids him farewell. He leaves with thoughts of suicide. Albert returns home to find his wife distraught. Werther sends a messenger to Albert, requesting to borrow his pistols, explaining he is going on an extended trip. After the servant has taken them, Charlotte has a terrible premonition and hurries to find Werther. An orchestral intermezzo (\"La nuit de Noël\") leads without a break into the final Act.\n\nAct 4\n\"The death of Werther\": At Werther's apartment, Charlotte has arrived too late to stop him from shooting himself; he is dying. She consoles him by declaring her love. He asks for forgiveness. After he dies, Charlotte faints. Outside children are heard singing the Christmas carol.\n\nNoted arias\nRecordings\nA well-regarded recording of the complete opera was made in January 1931 by French Columbia with a French cast and the orchestra and chorus of the Opéra-Comique under the direction of Élie Cohen. Henry Fogel of Fanfare magazine, writing in 1992, counted 14 complete recordings and considered it the finest of the lot. His colleague, James Camner, reviewing the Opera d'Oro reissue in 2003, called it \"one of the treasures of recorded opera. ... Unfortunately, the transfer is over filtered. The high frequencies are lost, giving the performance an unwarranted flatness. Happily, Naxos offers the same recording expertly transferred by Ward Marston, and acquiring it is a must.\" Alan Blyth, while giving a very positive review of the reissue of the recording with Albert Lance as Werther and Rita Gorr as Charlotte in 2004, nevertheless pointed out that \"neither quite has the ideal subtlety of the best Massenet singers, such as Vallin and Thill on the classic, pre-war set, now on Naxos\".In addition, many of the greatest French and Italian singers of the past century or more have recorded individual arias from Massenet's masterwork.\nPassage 10:\nThe Novel of Werther\nThe Novel of Werther (French: Le Roman de Werther) is a 1938 French historical drama film directed by Max Ophüls and starring Pierre Richard-Willm, Annie Vernay and Jean Galland.

It is considered a classic of utopian speculative science fiction as well as a feminist classic. The novel was originally published by Alfred A. Knopf. Piercy draws on several inspirations to write this novel such as utopian studies, technoscience, socialization, and female fantasies. One of Piercy's main inspirations for her utopian novels is Plato's Republic. Piercy describes the novel as, \"if only…\" Piercy even compares Woman on the Edge of Time and another one of her utopian novels He, She, and It when discussing the themes and inspirations behind it.\n\nPlot summary\nIn the 1970s, an impoverished and intelligent thirty-seven-year-old Mexican-American woman Consuelo \"Connie\" Ramos, a resident of Spanish Harlem, is unfairly incarcerated in a New York mental hospital due to her supposed violent criminal tendencies. She had been recently released from a previous voluntary commitment in a mental institution after an episode of drug-related child neglect, which led her also to lose custody of her daughter. Connie is caught within the government welfare and child custody labyrinth of 1970s New York City. She is after the first scene recommitted involuntarily by her niece's pimp on grounds of violent behavior, after she strikes him in the course of protecting her niece, Dolly (Dolores), from him. Dolly had sought Connie's protection because she was being forced by the pimp into having an illegal abortion. \nOne of Connie's chief abilities is her perceptiveness and empathy. As a result, before being committed, Connie had for some time begun to communicate with (\"receive\" from) a figure from the future: an androgynous young woman named Luciente. Connie retains her visions and her connection, which become more and more real, even while heavily drugged in the mental hospital in New York, based loosely on Bellevue and other mental institutions from that period. Luciente is time-traveling from a future (the date is given as 2137), in which a number of goals of the political and social agenda of the late sixties' and early seventies' radical movements have been fulfilled. Environmental pollution, patriarchy, homelessness, homophobia, racism, ethnocentrism, phallogocentrism, sexism, class-subordination, food injustice, consumerism, imperialism, and totalitarianism have been effectively dealt with in this world, which is governmentally decentralized in a loose version of anarchism. \nIn contrast to the contemporary 1970s setting in an abusive mental institution where patients are labelled \"violent,\" \"incapable,\" \"irrational,\" etc. on the basis of their response to an unjust and harshly stratified class-, race-, and gender-ridden society, future dwellers experience enormous personal freedom and train one another in self-control and ways of producing win-win results in all social situations. In particular, the subjects of volition and free will, mental institutionalization, and interference in others' willed actions are key to the vision of the utopian future. Connie is introduced by Luciente to the agrarian, communal community of Mattapoisett, where children grow up in a culture where they are encouraged to know themselves and their own minds and emotions thoroughly through practicing a type of meditation from an early age (\"in-knowing\"), in the service of social harmony and the ability to communicate with others without domination or subservience. \nThis classless, gender-neutral (non-gendered pronouns are used, notably \"per\" or \"person\" for he or she), racial-difference-affirming society is sketched in detail, including meeting and discussion structures that eliminate power differentials as much as possible, the extensive use of technology only for social goods, the replacement of business and corporate agendas with general planning for social justice and respect for all human beings' individuality. Disputes between towns and regions are settled peacefully through discussion and merit-based competition of ideas, with the winning parties being obliged to \"throw a big party for\" or otherwise conciliate the losers in each case, in order to maintain friendly relations. \nA 1970s emphasis on individual freedom can be seen at times: each person lives in a private tent or one-room home, and children develop outside the womb of an individual and are adopted by three \"mothers\" (of any gender) who guard and teach them only until puberty; every person chooses their own name, and can also choose their field of study and work, as well as when to disengage from their community, or join a new one; total freedom also applies to one's mental and emotional choices—in this future world one can check oneself into and out of the equivalent of a sanitorium at will, go into or out of various kinds of therapy, or take a mental break in some other way, and no other person has the right to choose this on one's behalf. One's field of work is self-chosen, and dicta apply to both one's life path and one's mental or emotional desires, needs, and capacities: \"Per must not do what per cannot do\" and \"Per must do what per needs to do\" are applied to both personal/emotional and professional life choices insofar as possible. There are limits to this utopia, which threaten always at the margins: the death penalty is imposed on occasion, and war is in the background, but both are considered extreme and unusual measures.\nConnie learns tools of emotional and physical survival from Luciente and the future population of Mattapoisett, and comes to feel that she is living at an important time in history, and that she herself is in a pivotal position; her actions and decisions will determine the course of history. In particular, it is slowly revealed that Luciente's utopia is only one possible future; alternate futures are a possibility, and the novel shows us one example— a future consumerist, hyper-capitalist, environmentally sick and strictly classist, racist, and gender-stratified society in which a wealthy elite live on space platforms, sustaining themselves by dominating and exploiting the majority of the population through total control of knowledge and technology, personal control extending to physical \"farming\" of bodies (harvesting organs regularly) and the surgical control of moods through the use of psychotropic drugs. Women in this intensely violent, misogynistic and homophobic world are valued and \"grown\" solely for appearance and sexuality, and plastic surgery that gives women grotesquely exaggerated sexual features is commonplace.\nIt does not decide for the reader whether Connie's visions are by-products of her mental instability or are literal time-travel, but ultimately, Connie's confrontation with the future inspires her to violent revolt against her institutional captors. She uses her limited means, despite her very restricted situation, in a desperate and apparently heroic way to prevent the dissemination of the mind-control technology that makes the future dystopia possible, putting an end to the mind-control experiments and prevents the lobotomy operation that had been planned for her and hundreds of other imprisoned patients. Connie acts in the tradition of revolity, family, and the workplace. The poem expresses the stereotypes, sexism, and patriarchal influences that women were submitted to during the 1960s. Not only were women subjected to poor treatment because of their gender, women also experienced discrimination and unequal treatment because of their race. While this poem discusses the topic of gender and gender stereotypes, it is important to recognize that the development of the doll that inspired the poem has brought up the racial discrepancies woman faced during this time. According to Elizabeth Chin, “These toys were designed and marketed specifically to reshape a territory dominated by an assumption of whiteness, but paradoxically, they have integrated the toy world while at the same time fixing racial boundaries more firmly.  Although not addressed in this poem, the racial discrepancies that arose after the creation of the Barbie Doll, such as \"hair type, facial features, and skin color” have been addressed throughout the years. Therefore, the purpose of the poem was to display the struggle women faced because of these societal issues in hopes of changing them. The poem shows the idealist view that is created by the appearance of the doll that causes people to question social norms and expectations that seem to exist in society.\n\nAnalysis\nFirst stanza\nThe first stanza begins with a girl being born, fitting perfectly into a mold provided by the society she was born into. The stanza lists toys that any little girl might play with, such as dolls and miniature GE stoves and irons. She was also given lipstick, compared to cherry candy using a metaphor. \n In a patriarchal society, women hold the positions of cooking and cleaning in the household. This, along with the makeup she was given, shows that from a very young age this girl was taught to conform to a specific gender stereotype, without even realizing it. The doll is also an important part of this stanza, as well as the entire poem. The Barbie Doll has been a cultural icon since it was created in 1959, a little over 10 years before this poem was published. It is somewhat controversial whether it is viewed as a “role model for young girls, an icon of American culture, and a model of aesthetic perfection” or on the other hand “a tool of racism, classism, and sexism, and disparaged as a contemporary epitomization of the cult of thinness.”   In the context of this poem, the Barbie Doll ends up being a negative aspect of the girl’s life, creating a poor self-body image among other problems. \n  At the end of this stanza, the girl goes through puberty. Someone in the girl’s class commented negative things about her body, saying she had a large nose and fat thighs. This is the point in the poem at which her insecurities have been grounded. Throughout the rest of the poem, she grows up striving to meet unattainable societal standards that her Barbie doll  represents.\n\nSecond stanza\nThe next stanza talks about the girl in terms of what attributes she held, but also how she and society did not see them. She was described as healthy, smart, strong, sexually able, and fast, yet she did not see any of these things. According to Robert Perrin, Barbie is described using \"robust terms\" throughout this stanza; however, she immediately apologizes for her positive attributes as if she was not good enough in the eyes of society.  She had learned from the time when she was a just a child that she had imperfections and was not good enough. She compared herself to her doll, and therefore apologized to society for her imperfections. She did not see the good in herself, only the comparison between what she was and what society says she should be. In this stanza, her qualities are listed one after another, which is then followed by her disapproval. This syntax helps the reader see all of the good aspects of the girl all at once, which then makes the reader question why the girl does not see them. The stanza finishes with saying everyone, meaning society, only sees her for her fat nose and thick legs, the same thing she was told by her classmate when she was a child.\n\nThird stanza\nThe third stanza talks about the sexist expectations that patriarchal society has placed upon her. As a girl, “she was advised to play coy, exhorted to come on hearty, exercise, diet, smile and wheedle.” \n  This list shows the expectations that are placed upon women in society. The patriarchal power within the society is what is responsible for the belief of certain “standards” of women. Women are expected to play nice, come across as good girls, be skinny, eat little, and be happy all of the time. Because of external pressures, they try to do all of it. There is sexism represented in these lines because only women have lengthy expectations to meet. Piercy’s diction in this stanza “create[s] a powerful vision of the way people exert their influence on impressionable young women, as well as undermine young women who, at heart, want to resist the influences of the dominant culture.”  The girl in the poem is easily influenced because she has conformed to society since she was a little girl. Because of this, she aims to meet all of these expectations, but cannot sustain them. She is worn down further and further “like a fan belt.\"\n and eventually kills herself trying to become as perfect as society wants her to be. She finally gave society her nose and legs because she could not live in this way anymore.\n\nFourth stanza\nThe fourth and final stanza talks about the girl’s death. She ultimately died trying to be as perfect as her Barbie Doll, a cookie cutter woman molded by society. She died trying to reach something that was unattainable, yet encouraged, which is where the real problem in lies. She was displayed in her casket, all dolled up. Society had finally made her who it wanted her to be but at the cost of her life. Now that she was covered in makeup, reconstructed, and nicely dressed, she was considered pretty. The stanza finishes with the line “to every woman a happy ending.\" \n This shows that in the end, this was all the girl wanted. She strove and strove to meet society’s unrealistic expectations and when she died trying, she finally did. Being viewed as pretty by society was her goal, and she accomplished it.\n\nConclusion\nThe girl in the poem was born in innocence and labeled \"girlchild\" but because of the society she was born and raised in to, she became corrupted. This poem shows a sad case of girl who lived trying to be perfect and died trying. From the very beginning she was taught to cook, clean, and be who she was “supposed” to be, or in other words, who society told her she was. Because of these sexist and patriarchal influences, she was never completely satisfied with herself. The tortures of society cost the girl her life.\n\nOther analyses of the poem\nBarbie Doll’ and ‘G. I.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSabal Trail Transmission Pipeline\nSabal Trail Transmission Pipeline is a natural gas pipeline that runs from central Alabama through southwest Georgia to Orange County, Florida. A minority stake in the venture is owned by NextEra Energy and Duke Energy. The pipeline has been being planned since before 2011. In July 2013 it was announced that Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) jointly awarded its parent corporation, NextEra Energy and Spectra Energy the bid to build the pipeline. In May 2015, Duke Energy bought an interest in the venture. Construction began in September 2016. The pipeline is currently scheduled to be in service by June 2017.\n\nEnvironmental concerns and federal agency permission\nThe construction of the pipeline has drawn concern from the communities through which it is planned to be built. Protests in Albany, Georgia and Valdosta, Georgia have occurred in response to the plans to build the pipelines. The threat of eminent domain and the environmental impact are among the concerns that have been voiced by citizens.\nIn late October 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommended to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the pipeline be rerouted away from the Floridan aquifer because of the karst geology that is prone to sinkholes and also contains wetlands.Environmental concerns have also been raised regarding threats to endangered species habitat along the route including crocodile, manatee and sea turtle breeding and nesting grounds. Others including Sanford Bishop, Hank Johnson, David Scott and John Lewis have voiced concern over the construction of a proposed compressor station near an already disadvantaged African American community in Albany, Georgia.Despite the recommendations of Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the pipeline's route in February 2016. In August 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the route through North Florida. Some citizens from the areas of the route continued to voice concerns about the environmental impact the pipeline would have the environment after it was approved by the various governmental agencies.\nThe federal permits require the companies constructing the pipeline to engage in mitigation banking.\n\nProtests\nThe construction of the Sabal Trail resulted in extensive protests from environmentalists. On November 12, 2016, fourteen protesters were arrested at a pipeline construction site in Gilchrist County, Florida after one protester locked himself to truck on site and the others obstructed its path. They had been inspired by the Dakota Access Pipeline protests and used similar protest signage. In February of 2017, two protestors locked themselves inside a section of the pipeline, citing the danger to people and the environment which would result from a pipeline leak. On February 26, 2017 an apparent protester was seen firing a high powered rifle at the pipeline construction site. The man fled and was chased by police until he crashed and was killed by a deputy after he tried to engage police in a gunfight\n\nConstruction\nIn September 2016, construction began on the pipeline. \nIn late October 2016, drilling mud seepage began leaking into the Withlacoochee River at construction along the border of Brooks County, Georgia and Lowndes County, Georgia from a pilot hole that had been drilled underneath the river in preparation for the horizontal directional drilling hole. After the leakage was discovered, the Sabal Company installed containment booms at the site and posted a vacuum truck to capture the mud seepage. The spill prompted protests from concerned local citizens on November 16, 2016.As part of the company's biweekly report for the week ending on November 27 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it was reported that a sinkhole had developed 165 feet (50 m) southeast of the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) hole exit point at the work site near the Withlacoochee River. The sinkhole had been identified on November 5 by workers in the field.\n\nOwners\nSpectra Energy\nNextEra Energy\nDuke Energy (7.5%)\n\nSee also\nSpectra Energy\nPassage 2:\nDuke Energy\nDuke Energy Corporation is an American electric power and natural gas holding company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nOverview\nBased in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy owns 58,200 megawatts of base-load and peak generation in the United States, which it distributes to its 7.2 million customers. The company has approximately 29,000 employees. Duke Energy's service territory covers 104,000 square miles (270,000 km2) with 250,200 miles (402,700 km) of distribution lines. Almost all of Duke Energy's Midwest generation comes from coal, natural gas, or oil, while half of its Carolinas generation comes from its nuclear power plants. During 2006, Duke Energy generated 148,798,332 megawatt-hours of electrical energy.\nDuke Energy Renewable Services (DERS), a subsidiary of Duke Energy, specializes in the development, ownership, and operation of various generation facilities throughout the United States. This segment of the company operates 1,700 megawatts of generation. 240 megawatts of wind generation were under construction and 1,500 additional megawatts of wind generation were in planning stages. On September 9, 2008, DERS updated its projections for future wind power capacity. By the end of 2008, it would have over 500 MW of nameplate capacity of wind power online, and an additional 5,000 MW in development.\n\nSubsidiaries\nDuke Energy Carolinas (formerly Duke Power)\nDuke Energy Ohio (formerly Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company, via Cinergy)\nDuke Energy Kentucky (formerly Union Light, Heat & Power, via Cinergy)\nDuke Energy Indiana (formerly Public Service Indiana, via Cinergy)\nDuke Energy Florida (formerly Florida Power Corporation, via Progress Energy)\nDuke Energy Progress (formerly Carolina Power and Light, via Progress Energy)\nDuke Energy Renewables\nDuke Energy Retail\nDuke Energy International\nDuke Energy Sustainable Solutions\nDuke Energy One\n\nHistory\nThe company began in 1900 as the Catawba Power Company when Walker Gill Wylie and his brother financed the building of a hydroelectric power station at India Hook Shoals along the Catawba River near India Hook, South Carolina. When he needed additional funding to further his ambitious plan for construction of a series of hydroelectric power plants, Wylie convinced James B. Duke and his partner James Blaney to invest in the Southern Power Company, founded in 1905.\nIn 1917 James Blaney was the founder of the Wateree Power Company that was formed as a holding company for several utilities that had been founded and/or owned by Duke, and Blaney his associates, and in 1924 the name was changed to Duke Power. In 1927, most of the subsidiary companies, including Southern Power Company, Catawba Power.Other Information\nAMG is known for its research  ,, on independent firms’ advantages in consistently generating excess returns.The company is also known for its commitment to corporate citizenship and community engagement.  AMG was a founding donor to the Sean M. Healey and AMG Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital, and continues to support the Center with fundraising and charitable events.\nPassage 7:\nProgress Energy Inc\nProgress Energy, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a subsidiary of Duke Energy and prior to its merger with Duke Energy was a Fortune 500 energy company with more than 21,000 megawatts of generation capacity and $9 billion in annual revenues. Progress Energy includes two major electric utilities that serve approximately 3.1 million customers in the Carolinas and Florida. As an independent company, the last chairman and CEO of Progress Energy was William D. Johnson; his predecessor was Robert McGehee, who died on October 9, 2007 at the age of 64 of a stroke while on a business trip to London.\nProgress Energy is the majority owner and operator of the Brunswick, Crystal River 3, Robinson, and Shearon Harris nuclear power plants.\nOn October 16, 1999, third quarter earnings of Florida Progress Corp. fell 20.5 percent as damage from Hurricane Floyd.On August 24, 1999, Carolina Power & Light Co. said that it would acquire Florida Progress Corp. for $5.3 billion, creating the nation's ninth-largest electric utility.The company's current slogan is, \"People, performance, excellence.\"\n\nHistory\nIn 2000, Carolina Power & Light bought Florida Power Corporation and changed its name to Progress Energy. Progress Energy represents a family of companies, including CP&L, Florida Power, Progress Telecom, NCNG and SRS, and an important new organization, Energy Ventures. The company built a new headquarters in downtown Raleigh in 2004.On January 10, 2011, Duke Energy announced plans to take over Progress Energy in a $26 billion deal resulting in the country's largest electric utility with 7.1 million customers. Duke Energy plans to \"maintain substantial operations in Raleigh.\" When the merger was completed on July 3, 2012, Duke Chairman James E. (Jim) Rogers became Chairman and CEO of the new combined company, while Progress CEO Bill Johnson resigned.\n\nEnvironmental record\nIn 2008, the Corporate Responsibility Officer named Progress Energy to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens. Progress Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005.The company is investing $300,000 in a UNC Chapel Hill study to map the offshore wind power potential of North Carolina. Progress Energy launched its SunSense-branded solar incentive programs in 2009.Progress Energy has installed flue-gas desulfurization technology, or scrubbers, to remove sulfur dioxide emissions from its nine largest coal-fired power plant units.Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified Progress Energy as the 29th-largest corporate producer of Air pollution in the United States in 2002, when it released roughly 39 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air. Major pollutants included nickel compounds, chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid. Progress has also been named a potentially responsible party at the Carolina Transformer Co. Superfund toxic waste site, according to the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nNaming rights\nProgress Energy owns the naming rights to the University of Central Florida's Progress Energy Welcome Center, St. Petersburg's Progress Energy Park, home of Al Lang Field, Progress Energy Center for the Arts-Mahaffey Theater, and the \"Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts\" in downtown Raleigh, NC.\n\nSee also\nList of power stations in Florida\nPassage 8:\nGulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline\nGulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline is a natural gas pipeline that brings gas from Mississippi and Alabama, underwater across the Gulf of Mexico, to Florida.

It has approximately 115 employees. The company has offices in Charlotte, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Orlando, Nashville, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City.\n\nHistory\nIn 1939, Duke Power (now Duke Energy) established a forestry department to manage company land not used for power generation. In 1963, this department became the company South Carolina Land and Timber. As the holdings expanded to include land in North Carolina, the organization was renamed Crescent Land and Timber in 1969. Some of the original land was sold to Crescent Land and Timber by the Singer Corporation.In the mid-1980s, the company was renamed Crescent Resources as it began to actively develop residential communities. Crescent Resources began work on its first commercial development, Coliseum Centre, in 1990. As of 1991, Crescent Resources managed 270,000 acres of land. Holdings included part of what became Lake James State Park, which it later sold to the state of North Carolina. Crescent Resources became a separate entity from Duke Energy in 2006,  with Duke Energy selling its 49% stake to Morgan Stanley.Crescent Resources filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and has emerged from it separated from the utility company. The company aimed to rebrand itself, renaming itself \"Crescent Communities\" in 2013.\n\nExternal links\nCrescent Communities\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBonus Army\nThe Bonus Army was a group of 43,000 demonstrators – 17,000 veterans of U.S. involvement in World War I, their families, and affiliated groups – who gathered in Washington, D.C., in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service bonus certificates. Organizers called the demonstrators the Bonus Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.), to echo the name of World War I's American Expeditionary Forces, while the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\nOn July 28, 1932, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned.\nA second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the Roosevelt administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) at Fort Hunt, Virginia, which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home. In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.\n\nOrigin of military bonuses\nThe practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from English legislation passed in the 1592–93 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers.\nIn August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at Valley Forge that threatened the existence of the Continental Army led George Washington to become a strong advocate.\nIn 1781, most of the Continental Army was demobilized. Two years later, hundreds of Pennsylvania war veterans marched on Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, surrounded the State House, where the U.S. Congress was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to Princeton, New Jersey, and several weeks later, the U.S. Army expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836.Before World War I, the soldiers' military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received 100 acres (40 ha) and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war's end, while a major general received 1,100 acres (450 ha). In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to 160 acres (65 ha), and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, 73,500,000 acres (29,700,000 ha) had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system. Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the Spanish–American War did not receive a bonus and after World War I, that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus ($1,010 in 2023). The American Legion, created in 1919, led a political movement for an additional bonus.\nOn May 15, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I, saying: \"patriotism... bought and paid for is not patriotism.\" Congress overrode his veto a few days later, enacting the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. Each veteran was to receive a dollar for each day of domestic service, up to a maximum of $500 (equivalent to $8,500 in 2022), and $1.25 for each day of overseas service, up to a maximum of $625 ($10,670 in 2023). Deducted from this was $60, for the $60 they received upon discharge. Amounts of $50 or less were immediately paid. All other amounts were issued as Certificates of Service maturing in 20 years.There were 3,662,374 Adjusted Service Certificates issued, with a combined face value of $3.64 billion (equivalent to $62 billion in 2021). Congress established a trust fund to receive 20 annual payments of $112 million that, with interest, would finance the 1945 disbursement of the $3.638 billion for the veterans. Meanwhile, veterans could borrow up to 22.5% of the certificate's face value from the fund; but in 1931, because of the Great Depression, Congress increased the maximum value of such loans to 50% of the certificate's face value. Although there was congressional support for the immediate redemption of the military service certificates, Hoover and Republican congressmen opposed such action and reasoned that the government would have to increase taxes to cover the costs of the payout and so any potential economic recovery would be slowed.The Veterans of Foreign Wars continued to press the federal government to allow the early redemption of military service certificates.The first march of the unemployed was Coxey's Army in 1894, when armies of men from various regions streamed to Washington as a \"living petition\" to demand that the federal government create jobs by investing in public infrastructure projects. In January 1932, a march of 25,000 unemployed Pennsylvanians, dubbed \"Cox's Army\", had marched on Washington, D.C., the largest demonstration to date in the nation's capital, setting a precedent for future He returned to the United States with his brigade in July, reverted to his permanent rank of major, and was assigned to the office of the Chief of Field Artillery.  Later that year he was assigned to the faculty of the General Service Schools at Ft. Leavenworth.In 1924, Glassford graduated from the Army War College, after which he remained at the school to serve on the faculty.  In 1927 and 1928, Glassford commanded the 1st Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill.Glassford subsequently returned to the War Department staff and served as chief of the Mobilization Branch in the Operations and Training Division. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1928.  Glassford retired in July 1931, and his rank of brigadier general was restored at his retirement as the result of a 1930 law which enabled World War I generals to retire at the highest rank they had held.During his career, Glassford was known for his out of the ordinary excursions into fields outside the Army.  He would frequently save his military leave, and then use it in large blocs to take long motorcycle trips or work in jobs that were atypical for a military professional, which included circus barker and newspaper reporter.\n\nLater career\nWashington, DC police chief\nIn November 1931, Glassford was appointed Superintendent of the District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department.  Known for his sense of humor, when queried by a reporter as to his qualifications for the job, Glassford quipped: \"Well, I've been arrested.  Once for driving through a red light and once for speeding on a motorcycle.\"  His tenure was most notable for the Summer 1932 response to the Bonus Army, World War I veterans who converged on Washington during the Great Depression to advocate for early payment of bonuses that were scheduled to be paid in 1945.Members of the Bonus Army established encampments in and around the District of Columbia.  Glassford worked to accommodate them, visiting their leaders daily by motorcycle to help maintain order, and arranging for volunteers to provide medical care, as well as donations of food, clothing, tents, and other supplies.  Favorable Congressional action was not forthcoming, and many Bonus Army members accepted the government's offer of free transportation home.  President Herbert Hoover ordered the remaining veterans to be removed, by force if necessary.  Glassford managed to obtain a six day extension before enforcement, hoping to persuade the Bonus Army members to depart voluntarily.  On July 28, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans who remained to be removed from government property.  Glassford’s police began to execute the order; they were met with resistance, and during an exchange of shots, two veterans were wounded and later died.After the shooting, President Herbert Hoover ordered the Army to force the veterans' out of the Washington area.  General Douglas MacArthur, the Chief of Staff of the Army, took personal command of infantry and cavalry units, which were supported by six tanks. The Army forcibly ejected the Bonus Army members, and wives and children who had accompanied some of them were also forced to leave.  The Army then burned the campsites.Glassford had established a positive relationship with leaders of the Bonus Army, and disagreed with Hoover and Mitchell about the need to eject the members and destroy the campsites.  He also disagreed with the need to use Army troops against the Bonus Army, which brought him into conflict with other members of the police department leadership.  When Glassford was unable to name appointees who agreed with his policies, he submitted his own resignation, and left the police department in December 1932.\n\nMove to Arizona\nGlassford retired to a farm near Phoenix.  He mounted a brief run for governor of Arizona in 1934, and also that year accepted a federal appointment to mediate labor-management disputes between workers and owners of lettuce and cantaloupe farms in Imperial Valley, California.  Faced with workers striking in an effort to obtain better pay and working conditions, conservative farm owners resorted to violence, spying on attorneys sent to California to aid the workers, and propaganda asserting that the strike was communist-inspired.  Though Glassford was initially sympathetic to the farm owners, their tactics caused him to come down on the side of the workers.\n\nPhoenix police chief\nIn March 1936, Glassford was hired to serve as chief of the Phoenix Police Department for 90 days.  The temporary appointment came with a mandate to reorganize and reform the department to end corruption and outside political influence, and restore morale.  He left the position on May 1, when a new mayor and city council took office and decided on a different reorganization plan.  In September 1936, Glassford was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in Arizona's 1st congressional district.\n\nWorld War II\nIn March 1942, Glassford was recalled to active duty for World War II and assigned to duty as internal security director in the office of the Provost Marshal General.  He retired again in December 1943.\n\nAwards\nGlassford was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Purple Heart.\n\nCareer as artist\nGlassford was an artist; among friends in the military, he was well known for his paintings of fireplace screens.  After his military retirement, he worked primarily in watercolors; his second wife and he resided in Laguna Beach, California, and many of Glassford’s paintings depicted scenes of Newport Beach, Balboa Harbor and other areas of the southern California coast.\n\nDeath and burial\nGlassford died in Laguna Beach on August 9, 1959.  He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.\n\nFamily\nIn 1908, Glassford married Cora Carleton (1887–1958), the daughter of US Army General Guy Carleton (1857–1946).  They were the parents of four children: Guy Carleton (1908–1974), Cora Elizabeth (Mrs. Lee Parke) (1910–1986), Pelham Davis (1911–1992), and Dorothy Seymour (Mrs. William Graham) (1913–1977).The Glassfords divorced in 1932. In 1934, Pelham Glassford married Lucille Painter (1906–1957).Glassford’s brother William A. Glassford, was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy who attained the rank of vice admiral before retiring in 1946.\n\nBiography\nCora Carleton Glassford prepared a biography of her husband, One Life is Not Enough, the manuscript for which is part of the Cora Carleton Glassford Papers.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBishop International Airport\nBishop International Airport (IATA: FNT, ICAO: KFNT, FAA LID: FNT) is a commercial and general aviation airport located in Flint, Michigan, United States. It is named after banker and General Motors board member Arthur Giles Bishop (April 12, 1851 – January 22, 1944), who donated 220 acres of his farmland for the airport in 1928.  It is located in southwestern Flint, and is surrounded by Flint Township to the north, east and west; and Mundy Township to the south.\nThe third busiest airport in Michigan after those of Detroit and Grand Rapids, it surpassed competitor MBS near Saginaw in terms of airline operations in 2002. 1,071,238 passengers used Bishop International Airport in 2007; 938,914 passengers used the airport in 2011.It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.The airport is currently served by three passenger airlines: Allegiant Air operates mainline service out of the airport, and regional services are provided by affiliates of United Express and American Eagle.  The airlines offer passenger flights to 13 cities across the United States.  The airport became a focus city for Allegiant on February 19, 2022.Accompanying the airlines is fixed-base operator AvFlight, which handles both general aviation and airline operations. Also based at the airport are flight schools Greater Flint Pilots Association, American Wings Aviation, and Crosswinds Aviation.\n\nHistory\nIn 1928, the Arthur Giles Bishop family gave to the City of Flint 220 acres for aeronautical purposes. The city-operated Bishop Airport until 1987 when the city and Genesee County formed the Bishop International Airport Authority to run the airport.The renovation and expansion of the current terminal, originally built in 1993, was designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills.\n\nHistoric airline service\nWhen the current terminal was completed in 1993, most airlines serving Flint were using propeller aircraft, which included Northwest Airlink and Skyway Airlines (operating as Midwest Connect).  US Air was the only airline providing jet service at the time, which they operated to their hub in Pittsburgh.In 1997, ValuJet Airlines began service to Flint, which became Flint's first low-cost carrier.  ValuJet was merged into AirTran Airways later that year, who continued to provide flights to Atlanta.  The success of AirTran's flights led them to increase service which prompted Northwest Airlines, who operated a major hub nearby in Detroit, to also increase service to Flint.  For much of the 2000s, competition between AirTran and Northwest brought growth in air service to Flint which included flights to Florida and Las Vegas.  Competition between the two airlines was so heavy, both airlines would often announce new competing services within days of each other.In 2001, Delta Air Lines began flights to Flint starting with Delta Connection flights to their hub in Cincinnati which operated for a few years.  Delta flights to their hub in Atlanta were added in 2003.In 2002, ATA Connection (operated by Chicago Express Airlines) began flights from Flint to Chicago Midway Airport using Saab 340 turboprop aircraft.  ATA Connection also briefly operated flights to Indianapolis before ATA Airlines shutdown ATA Connection in 2005.  American Eagle subsequently started flights to Chicago O'Hare International Airport by the end of that year.  American Eagle also had flights from Flint to Dallas/Fort Worth and LaGuardia Airport in New York in the late 2000s.Northwest Airlines, who operated in Flint for many years, was merged into Delta Air Lines in 2009.  After the merger, Delta continued to operate flights to Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul, which Northwest previously operated.  However, Delta discontinued the short flights to Detroit in 2013.United Express added flights to Chicago O'Hare International Airport in 2014 after discontinuing flights to Cleveland (which had started years earlier by United's predecessor Continental Airlines).AirTran was merged into Southwest Airlines in 2014.  Southwest continued to serve Flint briefly following the merger and offered Boeing 737 flights from Flint to Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa, Baltimore, and seasonal service to Fort Myers before dropping them and serving only Chicago Midway Airport in 2016. While flights to Midway were full, Southwest did not see adequate profit from the short flight and ceased service to Flint in 2018.After Southwest's service downgrade in 2016, Allegiant Air saw the demand in Flint for low cost flights to popular tourist destinations and began service to Orlando/Sanford and Tampa/Clearwater – St. Petersburg in 2016. The success of those routes led to additional service to Punta Gorda, Florida, in 2018 and seasonal service to both Ft. Lauderdale and Myrtle Beach.Although Allegiant was a welcome to passengers at Flint, the lack of daily flights that Southwest had offered plus the Delta Connection cancellation of their twice daily Minneapolis flight led Flint to their lowest passenger numbers in over a decade. Statistics from the airport for 2018 show the number of passengers boarding flights at Bishop down about 10%: from 400,781 in 2017 to 360,609 in 2018, the lowest number of departing flights from Flint since 2002. Allegiant Air added service between Flint and Nashville on June 5, 2020. On November 17, 2020, Allegiant announced it would begin service between Flint and Las Vegas, starting March 4, 2021. Allegiant has announced it will offer service to Boston and Jacksonville, Florida starting in March 2022. On February 1, 2022, Allegiant later announced it will begin serve between Flint and Savannah, Georgia beginning April 15, 2022.Despite the 2018 results, early 2019 saw Allegiant become the number-one air carrier in Flint, carrying 41% of Flint's passengers in February. Envoy Air (as American Eagle) also started a fourth daily flight to Chicago O'Hare. On April 11, 2019, PSA Airlines (as American Eagle) announced twice daily service to Charlotte to begin in September 2019.  American's flights to Charlotte were discontinued in 2022.Delta Air Lines indefinitely suspended flights their lastit was announced, due to the impending merger with Shuttle America, that the 80-seat Embraer E175s operated for American Eagle (previously US Airways Express) would have the last row of seats removed (4 in total) to conform with Delta's scope clause, which limits all regional jets to a maximum of 76 seats. These aircraft were retrofitted to American's standard Embraer E175 layout.\nOn January 31, 2017, all existing aircraft operating under the Shuttle America operating certificate were transferred to the Republic Airline Inc. operating certificate, thus ceasing operations for Shuttle America, and completing the merger process of both subsidiaries. The move made Republic the largest operator of Embraer E170 and Embraer E175 aircraft in the world.\nOn December 20, 2018, Republic Airways announced that it had finalized a firm order for 100 Embraer E175 aircraft, stating that deliveries for the new aircraft would start in the second half of 2020 In October 2019, Republic received the first of 30 E175s to be transferred from Compass Airlines upon the cancellation of their contract with Delta.In September 2021, Republic agreed to sell 11 E170s and 6 E175s to Envoy.\n\nRetired fleet\nIncidents\nOn 9 April 2017, a passenger was forced off of a Republic-operated United Express flight in Chicago bound for Louisville. The passenger was forced off the flight by Department of Aviation officers after he refused to give up his seat to an airline employee. He attempted to run back onto the aircraft, but was forcibly removed. A video posted on social media showing him being injured and dragged off the plane led to a public outcry against United Airlines.\nOn 21 June 2018, a Republic-owned E170 registered N876RW was damaged by a fire while undergoing maintenance at John Glenn Columbus International Airport. The aircraft was deemed to be damaged beyond economical repair.\nOn 10 May 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating Delta Connection flight 5935 was heading towards New York's LaGuardia Airport when a suicidal passenger attempted to open a cabin door in mid-flight, causing the pilots to declare an emergency shortly before landing. The situation was brought under control, after which the plane landed safely and was met by law enforcement at the gate.\nOn 6 November 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating American Eagle Flight 4439 returned to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after suffering severe controllability issues after takeoff: ATC flight data recorded the crew stating a \"trim runaway\" and a \"stalling situation\". The data shows the aircraft rapidly climbing to 15,100 ft (4,600 m) and slowing down to 160 knots (300 km/h) while performing nearly two full right turns.\nOn June 4, 2022, a Republic Airways flight from Indianapolis to Chicago aborted its takeoff after an odor of smoke was reported in the aircraft. The aircraft was evacuated on a taxiway. No injuries were reported.\n\nSee also\nAir transportation in the United States\nPassage 6:\nUnited Express Flight 5925\nUnited Express Flight 5925, operated by Great Lakes Airlines with a Beechcraft 1900 twin turboprop, was a regularly scheduled flight from Chicago O'Hare International Airport to Quincy, Illinois, with an intermediate stop in Burlington, Iowa. On November 19, 1996, the aircraft collided on landing at Quincy with another Beechcraft, a private King Air, that was taking off from an intersecting runway. The crash was known as the Quincy runway disaster. Fourteen people (twelve on board the 1900 and two on board the King Air) were killed as a result.\n\nAccident\nUnited Express Flight 5925 had departed from Chicago at 15:25, with Captain Kate Gathje (30), First Officer Darren McCombs (24), and ten passengers. After a stop at Burlington, Iowa, the flight proceeded to Quincy. Two aircraft at Quincy were ready for departure when Flight 5925 was on approach. Both aircraft, a Beechcraft King Air and a Piper Cherokee were proceeding to Runway 4. As Quincy is a non-towered airport, all three aircraft were communicating on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency. On approach, Captain Gathje inquired as to whether the King Air would hold short of the runway, or depart before their arrival. After receiving no response, Gathje called again and received a reply from the Cherokee that they were holding short of Runway 4. However, because of a simultaneous sound emitted by the ground proximity warning system in the 1900's cockpit, only part of the transmission was received by the 1900. As a result,  the United Express crew misunderstood the transmission as an indication that both the King Air and the Cherokee would not take off until after Flight 5925 had cleared the runway.Assuming that both planes were holding short, Flight 5925 landed on Runway 13. However, the King Air had taxied into position on Runway 4 and had begun its takeoff roll when Flight 5925 landed. Both aircraft collided at the intersection of Runways 4 and 13. The aircraft skidded for 110 feet (34 m), coming to rest alongside Runway 13, and caught fire. All 12 aboard the United Express flight survived the initial impact but were trapped inside by a jammed door. Several pilots in the vicinity of the crash came to the scene but were unable to open the doors of the aircraft before both planes were destroyed by fire. All 12 aboard Flight 5925 and both pilots of the King Air, Neal Reinwald (63) and Laura Winkleman Brooks (34), died from smoke inhalation.: 19\n\nCause\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause of the accident was the King Air pilots' failure to effectively monitor both the common frequency and to scan for traffic. A contributing factor was the Cherokee's transmission at the same time as the United Express transmission. Lack of adequate rescue and firefighting equipment was cited as a factor in the high fatality rate.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe crash was featured in the 15th season of the television documentary series Mayday in an episode titled \"Fatal Transmission\", which featured interviews with witnesses and accident investigators and a dramatic reenactment of the crash.\n\nSee also\nLos Angeles runway disaster\nTenerife airport disaster\nLinate Airport disaster\nMadrid runway disaster\n1990 Wayne County Airport runway collision\nTWA Flight 427\nAir Canada Flight 759\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS One (stylized PLOS ONE, and formerly PLoS ONE) is a peer-reviewed open access mega journal published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) since 2006. The journal covers primary research from any discipline within science and medicine. The Public Library of Science began in 2000 with an online petition initiative by Nobel Prize winner Harold Varmus, formerly director of the National Institutes of Health and at that time director of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center; Patrick O. Brown, a biochemist at Stanford University; and Michael Eisen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\nSubmissions are subject to an article processing charge, and according to the journal, papers are not to be excluded on the basis of lack of perceived importance or adherence to a scientific field. All submissions go through a pre-publication review by a member of the board of academic editors, who can elect to seek an opinion from an external reviewer. In January 2010, the journal was included in the Journal Citation Reports and received its first impact factor of 4.411. According to Journal Citation Reports, PLOS ONE's 2022 impact factor is 3.7. PLOS One papers are published under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment\nThe Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded PLOS a $9 million grant in December 2002 and $1 million grant in May 2006 for its financial sustainability and launch of new free-access biomedical journals. Later, PLOS One was launched in December 2006 as a beta version named PLOS One. It launched with commenting and note-making functionality, and added the ability to rate articles in July 2007. In September 2007, the ability to leave \"trackbacks\" on articles was added. In August 2008, the journal moved from a weekly to a daily publication schedule, publishing articles as soon as they became ready. PLOS One came out of \"beta\" in October 2008.\nIn September 2009, as part of its article-level metrics program, PLOS One made its full online usage data, including HTML page views and PDF or XML download statistics, publicly available for every published article. In mid-2012, as part of a rebranding of PLoS as PLOS, the journal changed its name to PLOS One.\n\nOutput and turnaround\nThe number of papers published by PLOS One grew rapidly from inception to 2013 and has since declined somewhat.  By 2010, it was estimated   to have become the largest journal in the world, and in 2011, 1 in 60 articles indexed by PubMed were published by PLOS One. By September 2017, PLOS One confirmed they had published over 200,000 articles. By November 2017, the journal Scientific Reports overtook PLOS One in terms of output.At PLOS One, the median review time has grown from 37 days to 125 days over the first ten years of operation, according to Himmelstein's analysis, done for Nature. The median between acceptance and posting a paper on the site has decreased from 35 to 15 days over the same period. Both numbers for 2016 roughly correspond to the industry-wide averages for biology-related journals. The average acceptance rates for submission across 2020 and 2021 range from 47.9 to 49.9%.[1]\n\nManagement\nThe founding managing editor was Chris Surridge. He was succeeded by Peter Binfield in March 2008, who was publisher until May 2012. Damian Pattinson then held the chief editorial position until December 2015. Joerg Heber was as editor-in-chief from November 2016 before Emily Chenette took over in that position in March 2021.\n\nPublication concept\nPLOS One is built on several conceptually different ideas compared to traditional peer-reviewed scientific publishing in that it does not use the perceived importance of a paper as a criterion for acceptance or rejection. The idea is that, instead, PLOS One only verifies whether experiments and data analysis were conducted rigorously, and leaves it to the scientific community to ascertain importance, post publication, through debate and comment.\nEach submission will be assessed by a member of the PLOS ONE Editorial Board before publication. This pre-publication peer review will concentrate on technical rather than subjective concerns and may involve discussion with other members of the Editorial Board and/or the solicitation of formal reports from independent referees. If published, papers will be made available for community-based open peer review involving online annotation, discussion, and rating.\nAccording to Nature, the journal's aim is to \"challenge academia's obsession with journal status and impact factors\". Being an online-only publication allows PLOS One to publish more papers than a print journal. In an effort to facilitate publication of research on topics outside, or between, traditional science categories, it does not restrict itself to a specific scientific area.Papers published in PLOS One can be of any length, contain full color throughout, and contain supplementary materials such as multimedia files. Reuse of articles is subject to a Creative Commons Attribution License. In the first four years following launch, it made use of over 40,000 external peer reviewers. The journal uses an international board of academic editors with over 6,000 academics handling submissions and publishes approximately 50 % of all submissions, after review by, on average, 2.9 experts. Registered readers can leave comments on articles on the website.\n\nBusiness model\nAs with all journals of the Public Library of Science, open access to PLOS One is financed by an article processing charge, typically paid by the author's institution or by the author. This model allows PLOS journals to make all articles available to the public for free immediately upon publication.  As of April 2021, PLOS One charges a publication fee of $1,745 to publish an article. Depending on circumstances, it may waive or reduce the fee for authors who do not have sufficient funds.PLoS had been operating at a loss until 2009 but covered its operational costs for the first time in 2010, largely due to the growth of PLOS One.  The success of PLOS One has inspired a series of other open access journals, including some other mega journals having broad scope, low selectivity, and a pay-to-publish model using Creative Commons licenses.\n\nReception\nIn September 2009, PLOS One received the Publishing Innovation Award of the Association for Learned and Professional Society Publishers. The award is given in recognition of a \"truly innovative approach to any aspect of publication as adjudged from originality and innovative qualities, together with utility, benefit to the community and long-term prospects\". In January 2010, it was announced that the journal would be included in the Journal Citation Reports, and the journal received an impact factor of 4.411 in 2010. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 3.7.\n\nAbstracting and indexing\nThe articles are indexed in:\n\nResponse to controversial publicationseton University.  The herbarium is named after William Steere (son of William C. Steere) and his wife Lynda, who endowed the herbarium in 2002.The Index Herbariorum code assigned to this botanic garden is NY and it is used when citing housed specimens.\n\nSchool of Professional Horticulture\nIn 1932, Thomas H. Everett expanded an existing training program into a robust curriculum for developing professional horticulturists.  Patterned after diploma programs at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the School for Gardeners combined academic studies with hands-on practical experience in a two-year, full-time program. With the exception of a hiatus during and after the Second World War, the School has trained students since then. Now called the School of Professional Horticulture, this fully-accredited program continues to develop horticulturists of the highest caliber for positions in both public and private gardens. After successfully completing the program, students receive The New York Botanical Garden's Diploma in Horticulture.\n\nExhibitions\nThe New York Botanical Garden has mounted public exhibitions throughout its history. In 1992, NYBG began presenting what would eventually be called the Holiday Train Show, an annual exhibition of model trains running through a display of New York landmarks made of natural materials. In 2002, it introduced The Orchid Show, an annual exhibition of orchid displays and designed installations with changing themes. Beginning in 2007, the Garden added an annual fall exhibition of kiku, Japanese chrysanthemums trained to grow in modern and ancient forms.The New York Botanical Garden has also presented large-scale, stand-alone exhibitions, including: Sculpture from the Museum of Modern Art at The New York Botanical Garden (2002), Chihuly at The New York Botanical Garden (2006), Darwin's Garden: An Evolutionary Adventure (2008), Moore in America: Monumental Sculpture at The New York Botanical Garden (2008–2009), Emily Dickinson's Garden: The Poetry of Flowers (2010), Spanish Paradise: Gardens of the Alhambra (2011), Monet's Garden (2012), Manolo Valdés: Monumental Sculpture (2012), Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life (2015), Impressionism: American Gardens on Canvas (2016), CHIHULY (2017), Georgia O'Keeffe: Visions of Hawai'i (2018), Brazilian Modern: The Living Art of Roberto Burle Marx (2019), and KUSAMA: Cosmic Nature (2021).\n\nExecutive leadership\nDr. Nathaniel Lord Britton (1891–1929)\nElmer D.

In addition, three structures are designated as individual New York City landmarks: the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory (designated in 1973),: 1  the LuEsther T. Mertz Library (2009),: 1  and the Lorillard Snuff Mill (1966, also separately on the National Register of Historic Places).\n\nSee also\nEducation in New York City\nList of herbaria in North America\nList of botanical gardens and arboretums in New York\nList of museums and cultural institutions in New York City\nList of National Historic Landmarks in New York City\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bronx County, New York\nOther botanical gardens in New York City\nBrooklyn Botanic Garden\nQueens Botanical Garden\nStaten Island Botanical Garden\nPassage 9:\nACS Macro Letters\nACS Macro Letters is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Chemical Society. As of 2017, ACS Macro Letters has the highest impact factor of any journal in the field of polymer science (6.131). With the launch of ACS Macro Letters, all Communications to the Editor that were formerly published in Macromolecules will be published as Letters in ACS Macro Letters. Researchers are advised turn to ACS Macro Letters for reports of early, urgent results in polymer science and to Macromolecules for more detailed discussions of comprehensive research findings.\n\nScope\nExamining both synthetic and naturally occurring polymers, ACS Macro Letters reports major advances in polymer synthesis, modification reactions, characteristics, theory, simulation, surface properties, and kinetics and mechanisms.  The journal reports on all areas of soft matter science where macromolecules play a key role, including nanotechnology, self-assembly, supramolecular chemistry, biomaterials, energy, and sustainable materials.\n\nReadership\nACS Macro Letters is intended for researchers in polymer science as well as materials science, nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and energy.  The journal makes it possible for these researchers to stay abreast of the most urgent research results in polymer science and its related disciplines.\n\nTypes of Articles\nACS Macro Letters publishes peer-reviewed…\n\nLetters: Short reports of original research focused on an individual finding of great significance to the field of polymer science.\nViewpoints: In-depth examinations and perspective on topics of current interest to researchers in the field.\n\nEditor-in-Chief\nTimothy P. Lodge served as the Founding Editor-in-Chief of ACS Macro Letters (2011–2017). In 2018, Lodge was succeeded by Stuart J. Rowan, who was formerly the Deputy Editor.\n\nSubmissions\nACS Macro Letters enables researchers in the field to bring their important findings in polymer science and related disciplines to the attention of the global scientific community.  Manuscripts are typically published within four to six weeks of manuscript submission.  The journal encourages submissions and publishes Letters from around the world.\n\nSee also\nBiomacromolecules\nMacromolecules\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWSYY-FM\nWSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a full-service adult hits format. Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County, from its tower site in Millinocket. The station is owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc.WSYY-FM plays a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers. The station also features programming from CBS News Radio (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades). WSYY-FM also airs When Radio Was.\n\nHistory\nIn 1978, WSYY-FM was founded on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9. Prior to their The Mountain 94.9 branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as North Country 95, airing country music full-time. The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes, initially as a short term lease agreement, but the transfer of ownership became permanent. Those land disputes would lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500-watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters). WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000-watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000-watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location). On November 23, 2016, the construction permit for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000-watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC.\n\nFormer sports offerings\nThe Mountain 94.9 carried local high school sports in season until fall 2017. The Mountain 94.9 also carried the schedule of Red Sox Baseball from 1997 through 2015, when Millinocket's affiliation with the Boston Red Sox Radio Network transferred to co-owned WSYY, concluding the interruptions to the music during Major League Baseball. The transfer was completed on April 2, 2021, when 1240 WSYY returned to the air with translator 102.5 W273DJ debuting with the opening game of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSyndicated programming\nWSYY-FM is one of two Maine affiliates (the other being WLOB in Portland) of When Radio Was, is one of the two Maine affiliates (the other being WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm, is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated country music countdown programming, and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show.\nPassage 2:\nKAND\nKAND (1340  AM) is a radio station that serves the Corsicana/Ennis/Waxahachie area, and is owned by New Century Broadcasting. This station runs a country music  format, and is also the home of Corsicana High School Tigers and Navarro College Bulldogs football games, and the latest news from the Texas State Network News, and CBS News. As of July 11, 2008, it airs sports programming from Fox Sports Radio during overnights and weekends. For many years, the KAND call sign was assigned to the station now called KWPW.\n\nHistory\nKAND began in 1937 as a Variety/Entertainment station on 1310 kHz but 10 years later moved to AM 1340 and has maintained its variety format until the 1980s when they made a slow transition to Country music. The original station owner was J.C. West, who also owned the Wolf Brand (canned) Chili plant in Corsicana. West had applied for callsign WOLF, but the Federal Communications Commission wouldn't permit it because the WOLF call letters are currently in use on Syracuse, New York's AM station.\nIn March 2008 Yates Communications announced FCC approval to buy KAND.\nOn July 9, 2010, Yates decided to sell this station to New Century BroadcastingIn 2014, KAND shifted to country full-time and switched news sources from ABC News to CBS.\nPassage 3:\nWSTU\nWSTU (1450 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Stuart, Florida, and serving the Treasure Coast.  It broadcasts a talk radio format.  The station is currently owned by Treasure Coast Broadcasters, Inc.\nWSTU broadcasts at 1,000 watts.  It uses a non-directional antenna.\n\nProgramming\nWSTU has a local weekday morning show, \"Get Up and Go with Evan and Bonnie.\"   The rest of the weekday schedule includes some brokered programming hours, with conservative talk from Fox News Radio, including Brian Kilmeade, Jimmy Failla and Guy Benson.\n\nHistory\nWSTU signed on the air in December 1954.  Les Combs was the original owner.  In 1969 the station was sold to Harvey L Glascock, whose family owned the station until 1997 when it was sold to American Radio Systems.  After a brief ownership by a Broward County businessman, it was sold to Barry Grant Marsh and David Pomerance.  Marsh had been Operations Manager of WSTU for many years under the Glasscock family.\nThe station was purchased by Treasure Coast Broadcasters in 2001.  When WSTU went on the air, Stuart went from the biggest city on Florida's east coast without its own radio station to the smallest city on Florida's east coast with its own radio station.  WSTU had a strong local news commitment from the start, and continues that to this day under News Director Tom Teter, who has been with the station since 1980.  Teter has won many awards for news excellence from UPI and AP including Best Newscast in Florida and Best Spot News Reporting. From the earliest days the Martin County community viewed the station as more of a public utility than a privately owned radio station.WSTU was also one of the first radio stations in Florida to broadcast high school sports on a regular basis and continues to broadcast high school football, basketball and baseball. Hamp Elliot did the play-by-play for many years followed by Teter who handled the play-by-play for more than 20 years.  Rick McGuire now does much of the play-by-play. This summary written by Tom Teter.the WIQI and WEMP news staffs were immediately dismissed, with subsequent layoffs occurring in the following weeks and months.After one month on the air, \"i101\" would move towards a hot adult contemporary approach. \"i101\" included some limited use of on-air staff, including morning host and former WLUP-FM staffer Jane Monzures, who shared morning duties with fellow \"Loop\" alum Pete McMurray between August and October 2012. In late 2013, the station shifted to a rhythmic adult contemporary format.\n\n101 WKQX\nOn January 3, 2014, Merlin Media announced a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cumulus Media that would see Cumulus take over operations of WIQI, WLUP and WKQX-LP. The deal, which includes an option for Cumulus to purchase WIQI and WLUP, resulted in Merlin relinquishing operations of its last remaining radio stations, and also saw an expansion of Cumulus' Chicago cluster, which includes WLS and WLS-FM. Cumulus executives indicated that they, at the time of rebranding, had no intentions of acquiring back the online rendition of \"Q101\" and related intellectual properties from the stations' 1992-2011 era.In announcing the LMA, Cumulus indicated that it would move the alternative rock format from WKQX-LP onto the 101.1 facility. The move took place on January 10, 2014, when the stations began a transitional simulcast. \"Closing Time\" by Semisonic was the last song played on \"i101\", while the first song played on the 101.1/87.7 simulcast was \"Times Like These\" by Foo Fighters. The simulcast ended February 17, 2014, when Merlin Media's LMA for 87.7 ended and Tribune Broadcasting began a local marketing agreement for the station (which is now WRME-LD). The WKQX call sign was restored on the 101.1 facility on January 17.101 WKQX's airstaff initially included Brian Phillips, Lou Lombardo, Lauren O'Neil, PJ Kling, and \"wALT\" (Walter Flakus of Stabbing Westward). In September 2015, Portland radio personality Marconi joined WKQX to host weeknights (replacing PJ Kling). Marconi left WKQX in January 2018. Brian Sherman, former on-air personality at Q101 from 2001 to 2011, and one half of the duo Sherman and Tingle, was hired as an on-air personality for weekends. Sherman retained his weekday on air role at suburban classic rocker WFXF. Russell Tanzillo from North Central College's WONC joined as a weekend host in September 2015. In April 2016, the station hired James VanOsdol, another former Q101 personality, to host a new local music showcase titled \"Demo 312\" (in reference to Chicago's well-known main area code).\n\nIn November 2015, WKQX and WLUP announced their move from the Merchandise Mart, where the 101.1 frequency has been broadcast from since first taking the airwaves in 1948, in favor of a new studio at the NBC Tower. Until the new facility was completed, WKQX broadcast from a temporary facility at 190 N. State. On August 4, 2016, the move of WKQX and WLUP to the NBC Tower was finalized.In January 2018, as part of Cumulus Media's bankruptcy proceedings, the company requested that a U.S. Bankruptcy Court release the company from several \"extremely unprofitable\" contracts, including its LMAs with WLUP and WKQX. Cumulus stated that under the agreement, which carries a monthly fee of $600,000, the company had lost $8.4 million on the two Merlin stations. WLUP was sold by Merlin to the Educational Media Foundation. On April 3, 2018, it was announced that Cumulus would acquire WKQX and the intellectual property of WLUP for $18 million. The sale to Cumulus was consummated on June 15, 2018.\n\nReturning to Q101\nOn April 18, 2022, Cumulus Media announced their purchase of Q101 Chicago from Broadcast Barter Radio Networks, as well as the Q101.com domain name, all underlying trademarks and related intellectual property that Emmis had divested in 2011. Cumulus Chicago Vice President/Market Manager Marv Nyren revealed to Daily Herald journalist Robert Feder that discussions had been ongoing for over four years to reacquire rights to the \"Q101\" brand. The internet station ceased operations, while WKQX reverted to \"Q101\" during the station's \"10th anniversary\" concert on May 3, 2022 (celebrating the launch of the current iteration of the format over the former WKQX-LP).\nPassage 10:\nKWPW\nKWPW (107.9 FM, \"Power 108\") is a radio station broadcasting a contemporary hit radio format. Licensed to Robinson, Texas, United States, the station serves the Waco area.  The station is currently owned by Bill McCutcheon.  Its studios are located in Waco, and its transmitter is located in Waco near the VA Hospital.\n\nHistory\nThe station began in 1972 as KCIR in Corsicana Texas. The call letters stood for \"The Golden 'CIR'cle\". It was assigned the call letters KXCL-FM on April 12, 1983.  On February 1, 1985, the station changed its call sign to KAND-FM, matching the AM sister station on 1340. After its purchase by Marcos A. Rodriguez in 1994, the call sign was changed on January 19 to KICI-FM, then again on February 20, 1998 to KDXX-FM. In 2001, KDXX applied for and was granted a move from Corsicana to better serve Waco, Texas. It was relicensed to Robinson, Texas as it is currently. On January 11, 2002 the calls changed to KDOS, on April 30, 2005 to KHCK, and on August 27, 2010 to the current KWPW.\n\nKWPW-HD2\nOn August 7, 2017, KWPW launched a Spanish CHR format on its HD2 subchannel, branded as \"Latino 93.5\" (simulcast on FM translator K228FK 93.5 FM Waco).\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJames Hill (British Army officer)\nBrigadier Stanley James Ledger Hill,  (14 March 1911 – 16 March 2006) was a British Army officer, who served as commander of the 3rd Parachute Brigade, part of the 6th Airborne Division, during the Second World War.\nBorn in Bath, Somerset, in 1911, Hill was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst before joining the British Army in 1931 and being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers. He commanded a platoon for a short period, and was then attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort during the Battle of France in May 1940, where he oversaw the evacuation of Brussels as well as the beach at De Panne during the evacuation of Dunkirk. After a brief period of time in the Irish Free State, he volunteered for parachute training and joined the 1st Parachute Battalion, and was its commanding officer when its parent formation, the 1st Parachute Brigade, was deployed to North Africa.\nHill commanded the battalion during its first airborne operation in North Africa, dropping near the towns of Souk el-Arba and Béja, in Tunisia. It secured Beja and then sent out patrols to harass German troops, ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties, and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab, although it was eventually forced to retreat. Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill, in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident, but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the French Legion of Honour for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England. There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division, and jumped with the brigade during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5/6 June 1944. After nearly being killed on D-Day, by an aircraft strafing his position, Hill commanded the brigade throughout the rest of the time it was in Normandy, once leading a counter-attack during a German assault, later being awarded the first Bar to his DSO.\nAfter advancing to the Seine, the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn to England in September 1944, but briefly served in the Ardennes in December during the Battle of the Bulge. Hill then commanded 3rd Parachute Brigade during Operation Varsity, the Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine, where he was nearly killed by a glider containing his own personal Jeep. He then commandeered a motorcycle and rode alongside the brigade as the 6th Airborne Division advanced from the Rhine to the River Elbe, at the end of which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO as well as the American Silver Star. After the war, he was briefly military governor of Copenhagen, for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross, and also raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army). Retiring from the British Army in 1949, he became involved in a number of charities and businesses. James Hill died on 16 March 2006, aged 95.\n\nEarly life\nHill was born on 14 March 1911, in Bath, Somerset, the son of Major General Walter Hill. He was educated at Marlborough College, where he was the head of the college's Officer Training Corps, and then attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst; there he won the Sword of Honour and became captain of athletics. He joined the British Army in 1931, being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant into the Royal Fusiliers (City of London regiment), the regiment which his father commanded. He ran the regimental athletic and boxing associations during his service with the regiment, and in 1936 transferred to the Supplementary Reserve in order to marry his first wife, Denys Gunter-Jones. For the next three years he worked as part of his family's ferry company.\n\nSecond World War\nWhen the Second World War began in September 1939, Hill was recalled to his regiment and given command of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers' advance party when the battalion left for France during the same month. The battalion was assigned to the 12th Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Infantry Division. He then commanded a platoon for several months, when the battalion was stationed along the Maginot Line, before being promoted to the rank of Captain in January 1940 and joining the staff at Allied Headquarters. The Battle of France began in May 1940, by which time Hill was attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort; during this period he was involved in planning the evacuation of the civilian population of Brussels, and also carried Gort's dispatches to Calais ordering the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At the end of the campaign, he took command of the evacuation of the beach at La Panne, and was on the last destroyer to leave Dunkirk. For these actions, he was awarded the Military Cross. On his return to Britain, he was promoted to Major and travelled to Dublin in the Irish Free State, where he planned for the evacuation of British citizens from the city should German forces land there. When this task was completed, he volunteered for the fledgling Parachute Regiment, part of the British Army's growing airborne forces, and undertook parachute training; when the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed on 15 August 1941, he was appointed as its second-in-command.The battalion was part of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division under the command of Major-General F.A.M. Browning. In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather on the day of the raid. In mid September, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and Commander in Chief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had beenment by the 9th USAAF, and ended on 20 July with a three-pronged drive to capture Bras and Hubert-Folie on the right, Fontenay on the left, and Bourguébus Ridge in the centre. However, the attack ground to a halt in pouring rain, turning the battlefield into a quagmire, with the major objectives still not taken, notably the Bourguebus Ridge which was the key to any break-out.\nRestored to its pre-invasion formation but with British 3rd Infantry Division attached, the corps was switched to the southwest of Caen to take part in Operation Bluecoat. 15th (Scottish) Division attacked towards Vire to the east and west of Bois du Homme in order to facilitate the American advance in Operation Cobra (O'Connor, 5/3/25 July 29 1944). A swift drive was followed by fierce fighting to the south during the first two days of the advance, with both sides taking heavy losses.As the allies prepared to pursue the Germans from France, O'Connor learned that VIII Corps would not take part in this phase of the campaign. VIII Corps was placed in reserve, and its transport used to supply XXX Corps and XII Corps. His command was reduced in mid-August, with the transfer of the Guards Armoured Divisions and 11th Armoured Division to XXX Corps and 15th (Scottish) Division to XII Corps. While in reserve, O'Connor maintained an active correspondence with Montgomery, Hobart and others, making suggestions for improvements of armoured vehicles and addressing various other problems such as combat fatigue. Some of his recommendations were followed up; such as for mounting \"rams\" on armoured vehicles in order to cope with the difficult hedgerow country (O'Connor, 5/3/41- 5/3/44 Aug 24, 26 1944).\n\nOperation Market Garden and India\nO'Connor remained in command of VIII Corps, for the time being, and was given the task of supporting Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks' XXX Corps in Operation Market Garden, the plan by Montgomery to establish a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands. Following their entry into Weert at the end of September, VIII Corps prepared for and took part in Operation Aintree, the advance towards Venray and Venlo beginning on 12 October.However, on 27 November O'Connor was removed from his post and was ordered to take over from Lieutenant-General Sir Mosley Mayne as GOC-in-C, Eastern Command, India. Smart's account says that Montgomery prompted the move for, \"not being ruthless enough with his American subordinates\", although Mead states that the initiative was taken by Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), but Montgomery made no attempt to retain O'Connor. He was succeeded as GOC VIII Corps by Major-General Evelyn Barker, a much younger man and formerly the GOC of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division who had been one of O'Connor's students at the Staff College at Camberley in the late 1920s. This marked the end of a long and distinguished combat career, although the new job was an important one, controlling the lines of communication of the Fourteenth Army. O'Connor was mentioned in despatches for the thirteenth and final time of his career on 22 March 1945.Having been promoted to full general in April 1945, O'Connor was appointed GOC-in-C North Western Army in India in October that year (the formation was renamed Northern Command in November of that year). By now the war was over.\n\nPost-war\nFrom 1946 to 1947 he was Adjutant-General to the Forces and aide-de-camp general to the King. His career as adjutant general was to be short-lived, however. After a disagreement over a cancelled demobilisation for troops stationed in the Far East, O'Connor offered his resignation in September 1947, which was accepted. Montgomery, by then the CIGS in succession to Brooke, maintained that he had been sacked, rather than resigned, for being, \"not up to the job.\" Not long after this he was installed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\n\nRetirement and final years\nO'Connor retired in 1948 at the age of fifty-eight. However, he maintained his links with the army and took on other responsibilities. He was Commandant of the Army Cadet Force in Scotland from 1948 to 1959; Colonel of the Cameronians, 1951 to 1954; Lord lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1955 to 1964 and served as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1964. His first wife, Jean, died in 1959, and in 1963 he married Dorothy Russell.In July 1971, he was created Knight of the Order of the Thistle. O’Connor was interviewed concerning North African operations in episode 8, \"The Desert: North Africa (1940–1943)”, of the acclaimed British documentary television series, The World at War. O'Connor died in London on 17 June 1981, just two months shy of his 92nd birthday. There was a small funeral, attended only by his family. There were also two memorial services, one held in London on 15 July, with O'Connor's great friend and admirer, Field Marshal Lord Harding, as he was now known, giving the address, where he stated the following:\n\nDick O'Connor was my ideal of a commander in battle; always approachable and ready to listen, yet firm and decisive and always fair in his judgement of people and events; modest to a degree, shunning the limelight and embarassed by praise; calmly resolute and courageously determined.\nThe second memorial service was held in Edinburgh on 11 August, where Lieutenant General Sir George Collingwood, who had been O'Connor's aide-de-camp in the late 1930s, made the address. Making references to O'Connor's campaign in the desert some forty years earlier, he then mentioned his numerous attempts to escape from captivity, along with his happy private life and his two \"wonderful partners in the home\", before ending his address with:\n\nSo there is in a sense a picture of three different people. The dedicated soldier and brilliant fighting Commander, a prisoner of war exerting all his energies and taking great risks to escape and return to serve his Country, and the quiet, unassuming little country gentleman with the kindly smile and charming manners, who was a wonderful host and a wonderful guest, but of course it was one and the same person and the chief facets of his character were, I think, great courage and determination, an impelling sense of duty, loyalty, extreme personal modesty, kindness and generosity and a delightful sense of humour. I think the jokes he liked best were those against himself.\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It documents the author's tour of Europe in 1990, with flashbacks to two summer tours he made in 1972 and 1973 in his college days. On his 1973 tour, he travelled with his friend Matt Angerer, pseudonymised in the book as Stephen Katz, who also appeared more prominently in Bryson's later book A Walk in the Woods, as well as in The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid.\nBryson's trip begins in the winter, in Hammerfest, Norway, where his goal is to see the Northern Lights. He visits numerous locations throughout Europe, commenting on the various aspects of life in different parts of Europe, and comparing them to how he experienced them in his earlier visits. The book ends with Bryson reaching Istanbul, Turkey, looking across the Bosphorus to Asia, and considering continuing his tour.\n\nPlaces visited\nNorway (Hammerfest, Oslo)\nFrance (Paris)\nBelgium (Brussels, Bruges, Antwerp, Spa, Durbuy)\nGermany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg)\nThe Netherlands (Amsterdam, Haarlem)\nDenmark (Copenhagen)\nSweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm)\nItaly (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como)\nSwitzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern)\nLiechtenstein\nAustria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna)\nYugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade)\nBulgaria (Sofia)\nTurkey (Istanbul)\nPassage 2:\nDes Moines, Iowa\nDes Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivière des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,133 as of the 2020 census. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Cognizant, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and Corteva have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area.\nDes Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\nEtymology\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. Des Moines (pronounced [de mwan] (listen); formerly [de mwɛn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.In 2015, Michael McCafferty of Indiana University, while studying the Miami-Illinois language, concluded that the name was actually a derisive term coined by the Peoria tribe. McCafferty agrees with other linguists that the \"Moines\" in Des Moines is a French derivation of Moingoana. What he discovered, however, was that it was not the actual name of the neighboring tribe; it was an insulting nickname they hurled at their rivals. It translates, essentially, as \"the feces-faces.\"\n\nPrehistory\nPrehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines\nBased on archaeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archaeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\nHistory\nOrigin of Fort Des Moines\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the70 to 1979. He attended Drake University.\nPassage 7:\nThe Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America\nThe Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America is a book by travel writer Bill Bryson, chronicling his 13,978-mile trip around the United States in the autumn of 1987 and spring 1988.  It was Bryson's first travel book.He begins his journey, made almost entirely by car, in his childhood hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, heading from there towards the Mississippi River, often reminiscing about his childhood in Iowa. The journey was made after his father's death, and so is in part a collection of memories of his father in Des Moines while he was growing up.\nThe book is split into two sections: 'East' and 'West', the former part being considerably longer than the latter. These sections correspond to two separate journeys made in the autumn of 1987 and spring of 1988. The first section covers the Midwest, the Deep South, the East Coast and New England, before returning to Des Moines. The second section focuses on the Great Plains, the South West, California and the Rocky Mountains.\nBryson's goal in this trip was generally to avoid tourist destinations, instead choosing to experience the real every-day America, stopping at small towns and forgotten points of interest. This book is an overview of the United States from Bryson's point of view. There is less focus on factual insight into the history, geography and culture of the destinations in this book than is found in some of Bryson's later books, focusing instead on observations made with the intention of being humorous.\n\nBibliography\nBryson, Bill (1989): The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America. London: Secker.\n\nSee also\nAmericana\nPassage 8:\nThe Mother Tongue\nThe Mother Tongue is a 1990 book by Bill Bryson which compiles the history and origins of the English language and its various quirks. It is subtitled English And How It Got That Way. The book discusses the Indo-European origins of English, the growing status of English as a global language, the complex etymology of English words, the dialects of English, spelling reform, prescriptive grammar, and other topics including swearing. This account popularises the subject and makes it accessible to the lay reader, but it has been criticised for some inaccuracies, such as the perpetuation of several urban myths.This book has also been published in the UK by Penguin Books under the title Mother Tongue: The English Language.\nBryson has since followed up this work with Made in America.\nPassage 9:\nBill Bryson Sr.\nWilliam Eugene Bryson Sr. (March 3, 1915 – January 31, 1986) was an American sportswriter who wrote for The Des Moines Register from 1937 until his retirement in 1978. He covered 32 consecutive World Series.\n\nEarly life\nBryson was born and raised in Winfield, Iowa.\n\nCareer\nBryson began his career as a reporter for the Winfield Beacon, his hometown newspaper.\nBryson Sr. has been called \"one of the finest sportswriters in the country and widely recognized as such.\" As his son Bill describes in The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, due to the quality of Bryson Sr.'s work, one prominent television sports journalist thought of him as being \"possibly the greatest baseball writer there ever was.\" He contributed to Baseball Digest and many other publications.\nThe Babe Didn't Point: And Other Stories About Iowans and Sports, a book of some of his best sports stories, was published by his son Michael.\n\nPersonal life and death\nBryson married Mary Agnes McGuire (1913-2015), an editor for The Des Moines Register.: 6  They had three children: Michael (who also became a sports journalist), Bill Jr. (who also became a journalist and a writer), and Mary Elizabeth. Bryson died of an apparent heart attack, on January 31, 1986, at his home in Des Moines, Iowa.Bryson's son, Bill Jr., the renowned writer, published a loving tribute to his father in 2001 which described how Bryson had conducted what was probably  the very last interview with Babe Ruth, just a month before the legendary New York Yankee died in August 1948. The profile also includes the praise of Bryson noted above by a former NBC News president, who had said he \"may have been the best baseball writer ever, anywhere.\"\nPassage 10:\nDown Under (book)\nDown Under is the British title of a 2000 travelogue book about Australia written by best-selling travel writer Bill Bryson. In the United States and Canada it was published titled In a Sunburned Country, a title taken from the famous Australian poem, \"My Country\". It was also published as part of Walk About, which included Down Under and another of Bryson's books, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, in one volume.\n\nSummary\nBill Bryson describes his travels by railway and car throughout Australia, his conversations with people in all walks of life about the history, geography, unusual plants and animals of the country, and his wry impressions of the life, culture and amenities (or lack thereof) in each locality.\nIn a style similar to his book A Walk in the Woods, or William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways, Bryson's research enabled him to include many stories about Australia's 19th-century explorers and settlers who suffered extreme deprivations, as well as details about its natural resources, culture, and economy. His writings are intertwined with recurring humorous themes.\n\nSynopsis\nThe book consists of three parts:\n1. Into the Outback\nThe first part of the book mainly describes the journey taken by Bryson aboard the Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth. He is accompanied on this journey by a young English photographer named Trevor Ray Hart. The author describes his experiences on the train, the places the train passes through on its way to Perth such as the Blue Mountains and White Cliffs. The author also supplies plenty of humor in the form of historical accounts of early explorers and settlers of Australia.\n\n2. Civilized Australia (The Boomerang Coast)\nThis section of the book starts off with historical accounts from the time when Australia was discovered and goes on to illustrate how the Australians built a dynamic and prosperous society from a modest and unpropitious beginning. The rest of this section is devoted to the author's account of what he considers to be Civilized Australia, with accounts of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, the Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise, and many countryside towns in between.\n3. Around the Edges\nThis part of the journey covers the Great Barrier Reef, the cities of Cairns, Darwin, and Alice Springs, and the mighty monolithic rock Uluru.  Later Bryson visits Perth and the Shark Bay area of Western Australia.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nEnglish general election, 1689\nThe 1689 English general election, held in January 1689, elected the Convention Parliament, which was summoned in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution. \n513 Members of Parliament were returned, across 53 counties and 217 boroughs in England and Wales, most returning two members. Only nine counties and 41 boroughs (a total of 69 seats) had contested elections, with the other candidates being returned unopposed. Six boroughs had double returns, where multiple members were recorded elected, and five of these were subsequently voided by Parliament forcing by-elections.\n\nThe majority of seats were not contested on a party basis, but partisan alignment can be identified by historians looking at subsequent voting on key issues. 174 members are identified as Whigs, and 151 as Tories. The remaining members, around 190, are considered uncommitted. An older estimate based on activity throughout the Parliament suggested that the 551 Members (including those returned in by-elections) could be listed as 232 Tories and 319 Whigs or Court Tories, with none classed as uncommitted (but with over 40% recorded as \"inactive\"). Finally, an estimate at the end of the parliament, when party groups had had time to develop further, estimated the strength of the parties as 254 Whigs, 221 Tories, and 38 uncommitted members.\n\nSee also\nList of MPs elected to the English Parliament in 1689\nConvention Parliament (1689)\nList of English Parliaments\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nEnglish general election, 1695\nThe 1695 English general election was the first to be held under the terms of the Triennial Act of 1694, which required parliament to be dissolved and fresh elections called at least every three years. This measure helped to fuel partisan rivalry over the coming decades, with the electorate in a constant state of excitement and the Whigs and Tories continually trying to gain the upper hand. Despite the potential for manipulation of the electorate, as was seen under Robert Walpole and his successors, with general elections held an average of every other year, and local and central government positions frequently changing hands between parties, it was impossible for any party or government to be certain of electoral success in the period after 1694, and election results were consequently genuinely representative of the views of at least the section of the population able to vote.\nThe election of 1695, however, was comparatively quiet, being fought mainly on local issues. The new government led by the Whig junto made gains in most contested constituencies, and their party was returned with a narrow majority. The junto's support was not certain, however, as their policies increasingly alienated backbench 'country' Whigs, who were willing to co-operate with the Tories, and the government frequently ran into trouble in the House of Commons. Eighty-five constituencies were contested, 31% of the total.\n\nParty strengths are an approximation, with many MPs' allegiances being unknown.\n\nSummary of the constituencies\nSee 1796 British general election for details. The constituencies used in England and Wales were the same throughout the period. In 1707 alone the 45 Scottish members were not elected from the constituencies, but were returned by co-option of a part of the membership of the last Parliament of Scotland elected before the Union.\n\nSee also\n3rd Parliament of King William III\nList of parliaments of England\nPassage 3:\nEnglish general election, 1690\nThe 1690 English general election occurred after the dissolution of the Convention Parliament summoned in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution, and saw the partisan feuds in that parliament continue in the constituencies. The Tories made significant gains against their opponents, particularly in the contested counties and boroughs, as the electorate saw the Whigs increasingly as a source of instability and a threat to the Church of England.\nFollowing the election, William continued his policy of forming a coalition government around non-partisan figures. The nominal leader of the new government was the Marquess of Carnarvon, though the Tories were able to use their greater numbers in the House of Commons to increase their share of government positions. Contests occurred in 103 constituencies, 38% of the total.\nParty strengths are as estimated by the History of Parliament, though division lists for this parliament are not available and so a precise count may not be possible.\n\nSummary of the constituencies\nSee 1796 British general election for details. The constituencies used in England and Wales were the same throughout the period. In 1707 alone the 45 Scottish members were not elected from the constituencies, but were returned by co-option of a part of the membership of the last Parliament of Scotland elected before the Union.\n\nSee also\n2nd Parliament of William and Mary\nList of parliaments of England\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nEnglish general election, March 1679\nThe March 1679 English general election resulted in the  Habeas Corpus Parliament, named after the Habeas Corpus Act, which it enacted in May, 1679 to define and strengthen the ancient prerogative writ benefitting all subjects. It was dissolved while in recess on 12 July 1679. \nOn the current issue of excluding the King's younger brother from the succession to the throne, 218 members were in favour of the Exclusion Bill, while 137 were opposed. However, 167 members did not attend the parliament at all, so their view about Exclusion is unknown.\nPassage 5:\nEnglish general election, 1685\nThe 1685 English general election elected the only parliament of James II of England, known as the Loyal Parliament. This was the first time the pejorative words Whig and Tory were used as names for political groupings in the Parliament of England. Party strengths are an approximation, with many MPs' allegiances being unknown.\n513 Members of Parliament were returned across 53 counties and 217 boroughs in England and Wales, most returning two members. Only 15 counties and 57 boroughs (a total of 100 seats) had contested elections, with the other candidates being returned unopposed. One borough had a double return, where multiple members were recorded elected, and another was subsequently voided by Parliament, forcing a by-election.\n\nWhile the number of seats had not changed from the previous election, their electorate had been substantially altered by royal influence. Following the Exclusion crisis, ninety-nine boroughs had received new charters, the aim being to eliminate the influence of the Whigs. The Whigs also lost seats in county constituencies - which were not liable to charter manipulation - dropping from around sixty county seats in 1681 to only eight.In the new parliament, the Tories now had their own majority in both houses, Commons and Lords. The exact breakdown of members returned at the election is not clear, but of the 525 members who served during the 1685-89 Parliamentary term, including those elected at later by-elections, 468 are estimated as Tis now Delaware.\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nAshley, Maurice (1966).

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBlood on the Dance Floor (band)\nBlood on the Dance Floor was an American electronic music group from Orlando, Florida, formed in 2006. The group's longest standing lineup, from 2009 to 2016, consisted of Jesus David Torres also known as Dahvie Vanity (born 1984) and Jayy Von Monroe (born 1991). The group released nine studio albums before breaking up in 2016 following Von Monroe's departure. It was reformed by Vanity the following year, initially with Fallon Vendetta. After Vendetta's departure, Vanity became the sole member of the group. Since 2019, Vanity has performed under the name Kawaii Monster and most recently The Most Vivid Nightmares.\n\nHistory\nAfter falling out as a touring musician with multiple local musical acts in the Orlando, Florida area during 2006, Jesus David Torres, going by the moniker \"Dahvie Vanity\", formed a musical group with friends Matty \"M\" Malaret, Christopher Mongillo, and Rebecca Fugate. Initially the group was considered a joke, but developed into Blood on the Dance Floor in the summer of 2007. Malaret left the group in late 2007 before the group's self-released first album, Let's Start a Riot, in April 2008. Citing the inability to tour, Mongillo and Fugate left the band as well shortly thereafter.During the recording of their second album, It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World, the band was picked up by producer and writer Rusty Wilmot. During the recording of this album, Garrett Marshal McLaughlin (Garrett Ecstasy) was recruited to do backup vocals and screaming. The CD was self-released in October 2008. Only 300 copies were made.Vanity and Ecstasy recorded the singles \"Siq With a Q\" and \"Suicide Club\" as a duo in 2008, and released three extended plays over the first half of 2009, I Scream I Scream, OMFG Sneak Peak, and Extended Play. The duo embarked on the OMFG Tour with other local bands Electric Valentine, Weston Buck, The Greenlight District, and The Crush in promotion of their upcoming album then titled OMFG.During the OMFG tour on a tour date in the state of Colorado, Vanity was arrested for sexual assault but was ultimately not criminally charged due to a lack of evidence and the tour continued with Ecstasy performing the remainder of the shows without Vanity. Ecstasy then left the band after accusing Vanity of being a sexual predator and was replaced by Jeremy Brian Griffis, known by his stage name \"Jayy Von Monroe\". Along with Von Monroe, Vanity and the group's new drummer and rapper, Nick \"Nasty\" Wenzel, released \"Horrifically Delicious\".\nMany of the songs originally recorded with Ecstasy intended for the upcoming album OMFG were re-recorded with new vocals by Von Monroe. The previous concept of the OMFG album was scrapped, and rebranded as EPIC, set for release in 2010. The band went on tour over spring and summer 2010 to promote the release of Epic. With Jeffree Star they recorded three songs for that album. The collaborations with Jeffree Star were short lived because like former member Garrett Ecstasy, Star had also accused Vanity of being a pedophile and a predator, claiming to have witnessed questionable behavior. Star later chose to go back on his accusations and sweep what he claimed to have seen under the rug due to feeling like the band was being victimized. He was then featured on their 2014 single \"Poison Apple\", from the album Bitchcraft. As with the previous conflict with Garrett, the three singles featuring Jeffree's vocals were re-recorded with vocals by Von Monroe, and the original tracks were not featured on the final album.\nIn October 2010, the album Epic charted No. 5 on the dance/electronic Billboard chart. The band headlined the Epic Tour and the Epic Tour Part II in support of the album.Even before the release of Epic, recording began for Blood on the Dance Floor's fourth album, All the Rage!!. The duo collaborated with several artists for the album, including Lady Nogrady, JJ Demon, and Nick Nasty. The album was preceded by several singles to promote the release, including \"Yo Ho\", and \"P.L.U.R.\", and \"Bewitched\" which became the band's biggest (and only) most well known song. The band later embarked on Warped Tour 2011 in June 2011, and released the album while on tour.\nA music video for their hit single from the album, \"Bewitched\", featured Nicole \"Lady\" Nogrady, who later said that she felt disrespected by the band during production of the album as well as on the music video, and found herself having to confront the band directly in order for her name to appear on the credits of her work with them. The song was subsequently performed by other female vocalists in place of Nogrady at live shows, and was re-recorded with vocals by Haley Rose for their 2013 acoustic album Blood Unplugged.\nThe album peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart. At the end of 2011, the duo headlined the All the Rage Tour and was planning the 'Tis the Season to be Killing Tour.In celebration of BOTDF's fourth anniversary, a digital compilation album entitled The Legend of Blood on the Dance Floor was set to be released on Halloween. The compilation's release date was pushed back, originally planned to be released as a CD, it was released as a SoundCloud playlist instead. The compilation features remastered versions of songs from the band's first four albums.\nBlood on the Dance Floor's fifth album, Evolution, was released on June 19, 2012 along with a deluxe edition that featured acoustic versions of two songs. Two music videos and four singles were released from the album.\nThe album featured tracks in collaboration with Haley Rose, Amelia Arsenic, Shawn Brandon, Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, Elena Vladimirova, and Deuce.As a thank you to their fans they released the three-song free EP Clubbed to Death! on June 20, 2012, for free through an app on Facebook. Their sixth EP, The Anthem of the Outcast, was released on October 30, 2012.Rumors of a breakup in 2013 were proven to be a hoax. Bad Blood was slated for release in September 2013. On February 18, 2013, the lead single \"I Refuse to Sink! (Fuck the Fame)\" was released, followed by the second single, \"Crucified by Your Lies\", and a third, \"Something Grimm\", on July 2, 2013.mixed reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 48, based on 11 reviews, which indicates \"generally mixed or average reviews\". AllMusic writer David Jeffries noted \"over-the-top performances\" and stated \"3OH!3 are nothing if not loud and shameless, so if you expect end-to-end excellence from their albums, you’ve got a lot to learn about cheap thrills\". Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt gave the album a C+ rating and wrote that \"Streets of Gold's beats still sound garage-sale-Casio cheap, but the album yields several doofy, affable sing-alongs\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times complimented its incorporation of hip hop, rock, and electro-pop styles and described it as \"an oppressive and convincing wall of sounds\". Alternative Press gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that it \"sweeps across a broad range of stylistic tones, maintaining levity while dabbling in comparably serious musical pursuits\". The Washington Post's Sean Fennessey called 3OH!3 \"cheeky stylists with quips that frequently devolve into misogyny\" and noted \"little depth\", but concluded \"Still, this is a group that excels when no one is listening to what they're saying, only to how they sound, which is always committed and fearlessly grand\".In contrast, BBC Online's Fraser McAlpine panned the album's lyrics and called it \"dumb for sure, but no fun whatsoever\". Ben Weisz of MusicOMH gave it 2 out of 5 stars and stated \"the lyrics are generally unimaginative, sacrificing any shred of credibility to chase the cheap rhyme\". Stacey Anderson of Spin criticized the songs' \"witticisms\" and noted \"brutish synths and hammy bleats\". Giving it 1 out of 5 stars, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called it \"grim stuff – a soundtrack for beer-pong tournaments\" and panned its formula of \"dopey electro rock bolstering 'raps' about drinking... and getting girls to 'touch on' their privates\". NME's Mark Beaumont gave the album a 0/10 rating and called 3OH!3 \"electro-hip-pop white bread American scum\", stating \"If Streets Of Gold's lyrics are unlikely to bother the Nobel committee, musically 3OH!3 are a boyband pendulum: the threat of the latter tamed and glossed by the cash-hungry urge to be the former\".\n\nCommercial performance\nStreets of Gold debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 with 41,000 copies sold in its first week. The album has sold more than 100,000 copies in US.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits for Streets of Gold adapted from AllMusic.\n\nMusicians\nProduction\nCharts\nPassage 9:\nHarnessed the Storm\nHarnessed the Storm is the second studio album by American electronic music duo Drexciya. It was released on Tresor in 2002. Designed as the first of seven conceptually linked albums that the duo produced over the course of a single year, it is the only one credited to Drexciya. Different aliases were used for the others.\n\nCritical reception\nPhilip Downey of Exclaim! described Harnessed the Storm as \"forward-looking, vocal-less, sci-fi stuff\". Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club felt that Drexciya \"still creates some of the most visionary electro around\", but concluded that the album's \"Detroit-style formalism\" sounds \"too old-fashioned to sneak the future into the past\".In 2010, Resident Advisor placed Harnessed the Storm at number 97 on its list of the \"Top 100 Albums of the 2000s\". In 2017, Pitchfork placed it at number 11 on its list of \"The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time\".\n\nTrack listing\nPassage 10:\nWhite Noise (Disclosure song)\n\"White Noise\" is a song by British electronic music duo Disclosure, featuring vocals from electronic music duo AlunaGeorge. It was released as a digital download in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2013. The song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The track is the second single from the duo's debut studio album, Settle (2013). The song was written by Howard Lawrence, Guy Lawrence, Aluna Francis, George Reid and James Napier.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nThe track was met with very positive reviews upon its release. Pitchfork labeled it \"Best New Music\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating:\n\nFor their latest track 'White Noise' they've hooked up with trendy newbies AlunaGeorge – a savvy collaboration that's been carefully timed following their shared domination of last month's ones-to-watch lists. That's not to say it sounds forced; Disclosure's humming bassline, swirling synths and addictive clubby beeps are perfectly tailored to Aluna's pitched vocal. The result strikes a rarely-heard balance between hipster-friendly and potential chart-dominator. .\n\nFreddie Holmes of The Underclassed gave the track a mixed review, stating that \"It's a great track nonetheless, especially to someone that hasn't heard any of either group's previous material, but my superfan standpoint has rendered me to be overly critical\".Billboard named it the eighth greatest song of 2013. The website wrote about the song, \"In a year in which Disclosure and AlunaGeorge watched their audiences and cultural cache grow exponentially, the two duos' wiry, icy-cool collaboration represented a high point for each\".\n\nCommercial performance\nThe song entered at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. The following week, it climbed 26 places to number two on the chart, beaten to the top by \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, featuring Wanz.\n\nLive performances\nAt the 2014 BRIT Awards, Disclosure and Lorde performed an electro version of Lorde's song \"Royals\", which transitioned into \"White Noise\", for which AlunaGeorge appeared on stage. The \"Royals/White Noise\" performance was released at iTunes Stores by the BRIT Awards on 19 February 2014; proceeds from its sales went to the charity War Child.\n\nMusic video\nThe song's music video has a security guard and he starts in an abandoned warehouse.\n\nTrack listings\nDigital download\"White Noise\" (featuring AlunaGeorge) – 5:40BRITs performance digital download\"Royals / White Noise\" – 4:59\n\nCharts and certifications\nRelease history\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nOvambo people\nThe Ovambo people (pronounced [ovambo] (listen)), also called Aawambo, Ambo, Aawambo (Ndonga, Nghandjera, Kwambi, Kwaluudhi, Kolonghadhi, Mbalantu), or Ovawambo (Kwanyama), are a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa, primarily modern Namibia. They are the single largest ethnic group in Namibia, accounting for about half of the population. They have retained many aspects of their cultural practices, despite concerted efforts from Christian missionaries to wipe out what were believed to be ‘pagan practices’. They are also found in the southern Angolan province of Cunene, where they are more commonly referred to as \"Ambo\". The Ovambo consist of a number of kindred Bantu ethnic tribes who inhabit what was formerly  called Ovamboland. In Angola, they are a minority, accounting for about two percent of the total Angolan population.There are about 2 million ethnic Ovambo, and they are predominantly Lutheran Christians (97%).\n\nDemographics\nThe Ovambo people reside in the flat sandy grassy plains of north Namibia and the Cunene Province in south Angola, sometimes referred to as Ovamboland. These plains are generally flat, stoneless and at high altitude.Water courses, known as oshanas, irrigate the area. In the northern regions of Ovamboland is tropical vegetation sustained by abundant but seasonal rainfall that floods the region into temporary lakes and islands. In dry season, these pools of water empty out. The Ovambo have adapted to the widely varying seasonal weather patterns with their housing, agriculture, and livestock practices.The Ovambo people are a Bantu-speaking group. In Namibia, these are the AaNdonga, Ovakwanyama, Aakwambi, Aangandjera, Aambalantu, Ovaunda, Aakolonkadhi, Aakwaluudhi and Aambandja. In Angola, they are the Ovakwanyama, Aakafima, Evale and Aandonga. The Ovakwanyama are the largest sub-tribe.\n\nHistory\nThe Ovambo started migrating to their current location around the 14th century from the Zambia region to the northeast. They settled near the Angola-Namibia border then expanded further south in Namibia in the 17th century. They have a close cultural, linguistic and historical relationship to the Herero people found in more southern parts of Namibia, and Kavango people to their east settled around the Okavango River.In contrast to most ethnic groups in Africa, their isolated, low-density pastoral nomadic lifestyle left the Ovambo people largely unaffected by Swahili-Arab and European traders before the 19th century. When Germany established a colony in Namibia in 1884, they left the Ovambo people undisturbed. The Germans focused on the southern and coastal regions. After World War I, Namibia was annexed by the South African government into the Union of South Africa as the Territory of South West Africa. This brought major changes, with South African plantation, cattle breeding and mining operations entering the Ovamboland. The Portuguese colonial administration in Angola, who had previously focused on their coastal, northern and eastern operations, entered southern Angola to form a border with the expanding South African presence. The Ovambo people launched several armed rebellions against South African rule in the 1920s and 1930s, which were all suppressed by the Union Defence Force.The South African administration in Namibia continued the so-called \"Police Zone\" in south, a region created by the Germans with a veterinary Red Line covering about two-thirds of the province later to become Namibia. Ovambo people were not allowed to move into the Police Zone, neither other tribes nor Europeans could move north without permits. This isolated the Ovambo people, preserving traditional authorities and reducing numbers of White farmers in the north. However, because of labor shortage in the Police Zone and South Africa, in part because of massacre of native Africans such as through the Herero and Namaqua genocide, the South African government allowed migrant wage labor. Numerous Ovambo people became migrant laborers in South African towns such as Cape Town and in the Police Zone, where they experienced segregation and lived under highly restrained human rights.The South African Apartheid rule was brought into the Ovamboland in 1948. The South African government declared the Ovamboland an independent province in 1973, and appointed chiefs aligned with the South African government's policies. The Ovambo people rejected these developments, and in 1975 the appointed chief minister of Ovamboland was assassinated. In conjunction with the armed SWAPO movement, Namibia and its Ovambo people gained independence from South Africa in 1990.\n\nReligion\nTraditional religion\nThe traditional religion of the Ovambo people is the primary faith of less than 3%, as most state Christianity to be their primary faith. The Ovambo's traditional religion envisions a supreme being named Kalunga, with their rites and rituals centered around sacred fire like many ethnic groups in southwestern Africa. The Kalunga cosmology states that the Supreme Being created the first man and first woman, who had a daughter and two sons. It is the daughter's lineage that created Ovambo people, according to the traditional beliefs of the matrilineal Ovambo people.The rituals involve elaborate fire making and keeping ceremonies, rain making dance, and rites have involved throwing herbs in the fire and inhaling the rising smoke. The head priest traditionally was the king of a tribe, and his role was in part to attend to the supernatural spirits and be the chief representative of the Ovambo tribe to the deities.\n\nChristianity\nChristianity arrived among the Ovambo people in the late 19th century. The first Finnish missionaries arrived in Ovamboland in the 1870s, and Ovambo predominantly converted and thereof have identified themselves as Lutheran Christians. The influence of the Finnish missions not only related to the religion, but cultural practices. For example, the typical dress style of the contemporary Ovambo women that includes a head scarf and loose full length maxi, is derived from those of the 19th-century Finnish missionaries.The Ovambo now predominantly follow Christian theology, prayer rituals and festivities, but some of the traditional religious practices have continued, such as the use of ritual sacred fire. They also invoke their supreme creator Kalunga. Thus, the Ovamba have preferred a syncretic form of Christianity. Most weddings feature a combination of Christian beliefs and Ovambo traditions. Their traditional dancing is done to drumming (Oshiwambo folk music).\n\nSociety and culture\nThe traditional home is a complex of huts surrounded by a fence of large vertical poles linked by two horizontal poles on each side. The complex is a maze with twonot initiates but turn to santeros and santeras for assistance on practical matters. In 1991, the Cuban anthropologist López Valdés suggested that about 90 percent of Cuba's population practiced some form of religion and that of that 90 percent, a greater number practiced one of the Afro-Cuban religions than \"pure Catholicism\". In 2004, Wedel suggested that practitioners of Santería \"greatly outnumber\" those who practiced Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism in Cuba.Although also found in rural areas, in Cuba Santería has always been a primarily urban phenomenon, predominating in the north-west provinces of La Habana and Matanzas. While it has both Afro-Cuban and Euro-Cuban followers, Wedel noted that in the 1990s Santería was \"more common in working-class, low-income neighborhoods dominated by Afro-Cubans.\" Wedel believed that men and women practice in roughly equal numbers. Some practitioners grow up in Santería as the children of initiates, although others only approach the religion as adults. While it accepts new followers, Santería is a non-proselytizing religion.Emigration has spread Santería across most of Latin America and also to the United States and Europe. In Mexico, it established a particular presence in Veracruz and Mexico City, in Canada it centred in Toronto, while in Europe casas have been formed in Spain and Germany. Santería was present in the U.S. by the 1940s, increasing its presence following the Cuban Revolution. Clustering in Florida, California, New Jersey, and New York, it attracted converts from varied ethnic backgrounds. U.S. casas vary in their ethnic makeup, often reflecting broader racial divisions in U.S. society. Based on his ethnographic work in New York City during the 1980s, Samuel Gregory noted that there Santería was not a \"religion of the poor\", but contained a disproportionately high percentage of middle-class people such as teachers, social workers, and artists. The American Religious Identification Survey of 2001 estimated that there were then approximately 22,000 practitioners in the U.S., although in the mid-1990s the scholar Joseph Murphy suggested that hundreds of thousands of people in the country had engaged with Santería in some form, often as clients.\n\nReception\nBy the late 1980s, Santería had received considerable interest from established Christian churches, health professionals, and social scientists. Some initiates mistrusted academics and were thus either vague or deliberately misleading in their answers to the latter's questions, although the 1990s saw non-Cuban ethnographers seeking initiation into the religion, thus blurring the distinction between practitioner and anthropological observer. The religion was also explored in other media; the Cuban filmmaker Gloria Rolando released the film Oggún in 1992. Various songs have referenced Santería and its oricha; the Cuban American singer Celia Cruz for example recorded a version of \"Que viva Chango\" (\"Long Live Chango\"), while a Cuban band called themselves Los Orichas. Santería's influence can also be seen in the names of the Cuban liquor Santero and the state-owned machete factory Ogún.Christian views of Santería have been largely negative, and in Cuba, it has faced much opposition from the Roman Catholic clerical establishment over the centuries. Many Cuban intellectuals and academics also take a dim view of Santería. Opposition to the religion is also evident outside Cuba. When the International Afro-Caribbean Festival in Veracruz was launched in 1994, it showcased art and ritual by Mexican santeros/santeras, although this brought public protests from Roman Catholic organizations, who regarded such rites as Satanic, and animal welfare groups, who deemed the sacrifices to be inhumane. The festival's organizers yielded to the pressure, cutting the Santería elements of the festival by 1998. Pervasive stereotypes link Santería to criminal activity, and its rituals for self-protection have been adopted by various groups involved in narcotics trafficking within the U.S. Santeros and santeras are often accused of financially exploiting their initiates and clients—an accusation sometimes made by other practitioners of Santería itself. Various practitioners have also found that their involvement in Santería has strained their relationship with spouses or other family members who are not involved, and in some cases adherents have abandoned Santería to join other religious movements such as Pentecostalism.\nPassage 3:\nFezara people\nFezara is an ethnic group of Sudan, who emigrated from Arabia to Egypt, and then to Sudan. The number of persons in this ethnic group is about 200,000. Most members of this ethnic group are Muslims. This ethnic group speaks Sudanese Arabic.\nPassage 4:\nMigene González-Wippler\nMigene González-Wippler is a Puerto Rican new-age author and a leading expert on the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santería.\n\nEducation\nGonzález-Wippler was born in Puerto Rico and has degrees in psychology and anthropology from the University of Puerto Rico, and from Columbia University, from where she earned a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology.\n\nCareer\nIn addition to her solid background in social sciences she has also worked as a science editor for the Interscience Division of John Wiley, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Museum of Natural History, and as an English editor for the United Nations in Vienna, where she resided for many years.   She is a cultural anthropologist and lectures frequently at universities and other educational institutions.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRegional Planning Association of America\nThe Regional Planning Association of America (\"RPAA\"), formed by Clarence Stein was an urban reform association developed in 1923.  The association was a diverse group of people all with their own talents and skills.  The goal of this group was to “connect a diverse group of friends in a critical examination of the city, in the collaborative development and dissemination of ideas, in political action and in city building projects”.  Throughout the ten-year span in which the association lasted, five leading members contributed to this goal.  Clarence Stein, Benton MacKaye, Lewis Mumford, Charles Harris Whitaker, Alexander Bing, and Henry Wright were the essential backbone of the RPAA. Originally an idea of Clarence Stein’s, through a series of introductions and acquaintances in Washington DC in 1918, the Regional Planning Association began to form.\n\nFounders\nClarence Stein\nClarence Stein attended the Ethical Culture Society’s Workingman’s School, which influenced his interest in the city life and social responsibility through its teaching. Stein was closely influenced by the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, and teacher, John Lovejoy Elliott, in involvement with movements and committees, such as the Hudson Guild Settlement House and the Progressive Reform movement in New York City at the turn-of-the-century.  Therefore, Stein’s enrollment at Workingman’s School proved to be of strong influence on his later interests and achievements.  The very principle of the Ethical Culture Society being “that an individual’s growth toward excellence comes from furthering the unlike excellence of others”, exemplifies the basis of Stein’s life achievements through the RPAA.\nStein first met future fellow RPAA members, Henry Wright and Alexander Bing, in Washington (in 1918) through a friend, Charles Whitaker (editor of the JAIA).  In 1920, Stein became the Associate Editor for Community Planning with the Journal of the American Institute of Architects and soon later discovered the idea to create the RPAA including his friends at the JAIA office, including Lewis Mumford, as well as many others. The group included members in various fields of study from architects to union leaders, city officials to writers, and engineers to sociologists. And so, on April 18, 1923, the first official meeting of the Regional Planning Association of America was held.  The association began with only a total of eight people present at its first official meeting but it soon grew.\n\nBenton MacKaye\nThe first major project of the RPAA was that of fellow RPAA member, Benton MacKaye; the Appalachian Trail, a trail which we would refer to today as a greenway, of which he wrote an article in the JAIA two years earlier (“An Appalachian Trail – A Project in Regional Planning”).  The trail was planned to connect a footpath from Maine to Georgia in an attempt to “lead civilization to the wilderness”.  The project was not directly implemented by the RPAA, however, their part was successful in introducing their idea to others and helping the various groups of Mountain Clubs come together to create the final project.  The majority of the trail was completed by the mid-1930s.  From this project came another main goal of the RPAA which was to create “the preservation of large areas of the natural environment, including parts of the wilderness, as a green matrix for shaping a “regional city” and for serving its various-sized, spatially well defined, specialized communities”.\n\nLewis Mumford\nThe success in publicizing this project as well as others was in large part due to Lewis Mumford.  Mumford was the RPAA’s leading journalist and spokesperson.  Having published his first book in 1922, The Story of Utopia, and well on his way with another, Mumford was extremely useful to the association. He worked on not only books and articles related to the RPAA but also wrote/edited policy documents.  Mumford also contributed to the group by sharing his interest of Patrick Geddes’ ideas on regional development and planning.  Mumford contributed concepts of “a dispersed yet concentrated urban culture integrated with nature” which were integrated along with MacKaye’s concepts into the RPAA’s later projects.\n\nSunnyside and Radburn\nThe leading community building experiments conceptualized and implemented by the RPAA were Sunnyside Gardens, Queens and Radburn, New Jersey.  Sunnyside started as a small-scale housing development experiment in Queens, New York.  The goal was “to produce good homes at as low a price as possible, to make the company’s investment safe, and to use the work of building and selling houses as a laboratory to work out better house and block plans and better methods of building”.  Radburn, New Jersey, would be the new and improved built community utilizing the analysis from the Sunnyside community experiment.\n\nthrough not only his own real estate company and wealth but through his outstanding real estate and business skills.  Bing, president of the RPAA, found the funds through outside contributions and personal contribution (more so than any other member) to support the projects of the association.  For the Sunnyside community project Bing founded the City Housing Corporation through which he would establish the funding and opportunity to complete the project.\n\nHenry Wright\nHenry Wright, known as the analyst due to his never-ending questioning and analysis on projects, worked alongside Stein in site designs and development on such projects as Sunnyside, New York.  Studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania along with work as a landscape architect and site planner, Wright shared many interests with Stein.  Close work in 1923 on the Sunnyside Homes development with Stein led to a trip to England in 1924 to study the designs of Unwin and Parker as well as that of Ebeneezer Howard.  Though close at the beginning of the association’s organization, Wright went on to establish “The Housing Study Guild” along with several RPAA members which Stein viewed to work more independently than directly with the RPAA’s projects.  This slight dispute would be the beginning point of the division and end of the Regional Planning Association of America.  In 1933, many members began to move away and/or join various other movements or committees which quickly led to the association's end.\n\nLegacy\nThe Regional Planning Association of America, led by Clarence Stein, Benton MacKaye, Lewis Mumford, Alexander Bing, Henry Wright, as well as many others started simply as a group of people with similar interests wanting to make a difference in the American towns and cities. Through the collaboration of these five, Clarence Stein – the organizer and manager, Benton MacKaye – the conservationist, Lewis Mumford – the writer, Alexander Bing – the developer-builder, and Henry Wright – the analyst, as well as the many other members, the RPAA conceptualized, experimented, and changed our view of American towns, cities, architecture, and planning in America.\nPassage 2:\nLewis Mumford House\nThe Lewis Mumford House is located on Leedsville Road (Dutchess County Route 2) in the Town of Amenia, New York, United States. It is a white Federal style building dating to the 1830s.\nSocial philosopher, historian and cultural critic Lewis Mumfordotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy of the organism.\n\nPolytechnics versus monotechnics\nA key idea, introduced in Technics and Civilization (1934) was that technology was twofold:\n\nPolytechnic, which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.\nMonotechnic, which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.Mumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being \"monotechnic\" in their reliance on cars. Automobiles become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as walking, bicycle and public transit, because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a ritual sacrifice the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.\n\nThree epochs of civilization\nAlso discussed at length in Technics and Civilization is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct epochs (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):\n\nEotechnic (the middle ages)\nPaleotechnic (the time of the industrial revolution) and\nNeotechnic (later, present-day)\n\nMegamachines\nMumford also refers to large hierarchical organizations as megamachines—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's stage theory of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern technocratic nuclear powers—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the Kremlin and the Pentagon, respectively. The builders of the pyramids, the Roman Empire and the armies of the World Wars are prior examples.\nHe explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged pharaohs and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from ancient Egypt to Nazi Germany.\nNecessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous bureaucracy of humans which act as \"servo-units\", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the assembly line, or instant, global, wireless, communication and remote control, can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of the Holocaust. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as \"Eichmanns\".\n\nThe clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution\nOne of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the mechanical clock was developed by monks in the Middle Ages and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole Industrial Revolution, contrary to the common view of the steam engine holding the prime position, writing: \"The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ....\"\n\nUrban civilization\nThe City in History won the 1962 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of urban sprawl, Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While pessimistic in tone, Mumford argues that urban planning should emphasize an 'organic' relationship between people and their living spaces.\nMumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the \"ideal city,\" and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.\nMumford wrote critically of urban culture believing the city is \"a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression.\" Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared \"metropolitan finance,\" urbanization, politics, and alienation. Mumford wrote: \"The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community.\"\n\nSuburbs\nSuburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:\n\nIn the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.\n\nReligion and spirituality\nMumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field. In one of his least well-known books, Faith for Living (1940, p. 216), Mumford argues that:\n\nThe segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.\n\nInfluence\nMumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  \"polytechnics\", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as Jacques Ellul, Witold Rybczynski, Richard Gregg, Amory Lovins, J. Baldwin, E. F. Schumacher, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Murray Bookchin, Thomas Merton, Marshall McLuhan, Colin Ward and Kevin Carson—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.\nMumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like Barry Commoner and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology. Ramachandra Guha noted his work contains \"some of the earliest and finest thinking on bioregionalism, anti-nuclearism, biodiversity, alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology.\"Mumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including Berenice Abbott's photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.Mumford was an inspiration for Ellsworth Toohey, the antagonist in Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead (1943).\n\nWorks\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPrimary Care Behavioral health\nThe primary care behavioral health (PCBH) consultation model is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic. The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care.Primary care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with behavioral health care needs that may overlap with medical disorders and that may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (such as stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change through behavioral interventions that can improve outcomes for these health problems.\nThe PCBH model enables early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems (such as chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity), which are the cause of many medical visits to primary care clinics. Behavioral health consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint. BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients' changing needs. Moreover, the integrated care model increases behavioral health accessibility, fosters communication between patients and their primary care team, and improves patients' experiences receiving primary care.\n\nAssociated terms\nPrimary care psychology\nProvision of clinical mental health services through a population-based focus on the common problems confronting a majority of individuals. Such issues treated in primary care may include response to physical illness, stress, affective concerns, substance use and abuse, and developmental and situational issues among others. Primary care psychologists are co-located with primary care providers and usually share the same physical space in practice. Primary care psychologists may retain the traditional session length of specialty care or may adhere to a brief, consultative approach that is solution-focused. Primary care psychologists may often be trained in health psychology programs, but not exclusively so.Behavioral health consultant\nBehavioral health consultants and primary care physicians collaborate within the same system. The behavioral health provider works as part of the medical team to meet the wide range of needs with which patients present.Collaborative care\nThis model uses databases or what are known as registries to track and monitor patients with certain conditions. Typical examples in primary care include diabetes and depression. Often the person managing the registry is a nurse or mental health professional who performs follow-up phone calls and assists the primary care team in following evidence-based protocols. There is often also a consulting psychiatrist who oversees the provision of care in primary care.\n\nRationale\nPrimary care has often been termed the de facto mental health system in the United States. Research shows that approximately half of all mental health care services are provided solely by primary care providers. Furthermore, primary care practitioners prescribe about 70% of all psychotropic medications and 80% of antidepressants. Thus, while it seems there are various \"specialty\" mental health clinics and psychiatrists alike, the primary care environment continues to lend itself to an array of psychiatric issues. One reason is that physical health problems can contribute to psychological dysfunction and vice versa. Examples of the frequent comorbity between medical and psychological problems include: chronic pain can cause depression; panic symptoms can lead to complaints of heart palpitations; and stress can contribute to irritable bowl syndrome. While these mind-body relationships may seem obvious, often the presenting problem is far less clear, with the physical health problem being masked by psychosocial concerns. In fact, of the 10 most common complaints in primary care, less than 16% had a diagnosable physical etiology. The psychosocial impact on primary care is tremendous (approximately 70% of all visits); however, it is curious that few mental health providers have traditionally placed themselves where the demand for their services is arguably the greatest. \nDespite the availability of outpatient mental health resources, research indicates that patients are still driven to the primary care setting. In fact, studies show that as little as 10% of patients actually follow through when being referred by a physician to receive outpatient mental health treatment. Many experts believe this low completion rate is tied to the stigma that often surrounds mental health care, causing patients to deny or refuse to seek help for psychiatric needs. As a general rule, patients who do choose to address their mental health concerns express a preference for services in primary care likely due to its familiarity and less stigmatizing environment. However, as many medical providers will admit, their training has left them ill-prepared to appropriately treat the psychiatric sequalae that presents in their clinic. The PCBH model has sought to address this dilemma by providing access to mental health services on site to more effectively target the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patient care. Resulting from close collaboration between physicians and mental health providers, the patients' needs are more adequately met by care that is more comprehensive and collaborative between physicians and mental health providers. Furthermore, the patients are more likely to follow through with primary care services, with referral rates around 80–90%.\n\nThe behavioral health consultant model\nBehavioral health consultants are culturally competent generalists who provide treatment for a wide variety of mental health, psychosocial, motivational, and medical concerns, including management of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and diabetes among others. BHCs also provide support and management for patients with severe and persistent mental illness and tend to be familiar with psychopharmacological interventions. Paralleling general medicine, patients who require more extensive mental health treatment are typically referred to specialty care. BHC appointments are typically 15–30 minutes long with the goal of utilizing brief interventions to reduce functional impairment for the population as a whole. BHCs tend to provide focused feedback to PCPs with succinct, action oriented recommendations to help effectively manage patients' needs. BHC interventions tend to be more cost effective and offer increased access to care, with improved patient and provider satisfaction.\n\nEvidence base\nA comparison of an enhanced-referral system to a BHC model found that more than 80% of medical providers rated communication between themselves and the BHC as occurring \"frequently,\" relative to less than 50% in an enhanced-referral model of care. Providers strongly preferred an integrated care model to the enhanced-referral model. Another single-site study atical resident, who had often found him snooping around mysteriously in the wards and in the intensive care unit (ICU) even when not on call. He had suspected that sudden deaths of some patients were due to Swango, but had no proof at that stage.\nAt this time, Swango rented a room in Bulawayo from a widowed woman who subsequently became violently sick after a meal she had prepared for herself and a friend. The woman consulted a local surgeon, Michael Cotton, who suspected arsenic poisoning and persuaded her to send hair samples for forensic analysis to Pretoria, South Africa. These clippings confirmed toxic levels of arsenic in the hair. The lab reports were passed on by the Zimbabwe Republic Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) through Interpol to the FBI, who subsequently visited Zimbabwe to interview Cotton and the pathologist in Bulawayo, Stanford Mathe.In the meantime, Swango had sensed that authorities were closing in on him. He crossed the border to Zambia and subsequently to Namibia, where he found temporary medical work. He was charged in absentia with poisonings. In March 1997, he applied for a job at the Royal Hospital in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, using a false résumé.\n\nArrest and guilty plea\nWhile this was happening, Tom Valery, chief investigator for the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), consulted with Charlene Thomesen, a forensic psychiatrist. Because of her considerable clinical expertise, Thomesen was able to review documents and evidence and give a criminal profile of Swango, along with her assessment of why he had committed such crimes. Valery was called by the FBI to discuss holding Swango. He called Richard Thomesen, who was stationed in the DEA's Manhattan field office to discuss the case. Thomesen's conversation focused on Swango lying on his government application to work at the VA, where he prescribed narcotic medications. There was enough evidence for Immigration and Naturalization Service agents to arrest Swango in June 1997, on a layover at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on his way to Saudi Arabia.Faced with hard evidence of his fraudulent activities and the possibility of an extended inquiry into his time in Zimbabwe, Swango pleaded guilty to defrauding the government in March 1998. In July 1998, he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. The sentencing judge ordered that Swango not be allowed to prepare or deliver food, or have any involvement in preparing or distributing drugs.Although the FBI, the VA, and prosecutors for the Eastern District of New York were convinced Swango was a serial killer, they knew it would be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. They also knew that they had a limited amount of time to amass that proof. Federal inmates must serve at least 85 percent of their sentences before being eligible for time off with good behavior, meaning that they likely had only three years to prove that Swango was indeed a murderer. They feared that if they could not find enough evidence to convict Swango, he would likely kill again. The government used this time to amass a dossier of Swango's crimes. As part of that investigation, prosecutors exhumed the bodies of three patients and found poisonous chemicals in them. They also found evidence that Swango paralyzed patient Baron Harris with an injection of what was supposedly a sedative. The sedative caused him to lapse into a coma, and Harris died on November 9, 1993.Additionally, prosecutors found evidence that Swango lied about the death of Cynthia Ann McGee, a patient he treated during his internship at OSU. Swango claimed she suffered heart failure; he had killed her by giving her a potassium injection that stopped her heart. On July 11, 2000, less than a week before he was due to be released from prison on the fraud charge, federal prosecutors on Long Island, New York, filed a criminal complaint charging Swango with three counts of murder and one count each of assault, false statements, mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. At the same time, Zimbabwean authorities charged him with poisoning seven patients, five of whom died. A week before the indictment was handed up, FBI agents interviewed Swango in prison. They told him that on the day he was due to be released, he would be extradited to Zimbabwe to face charges of murder and attempted murder. Knowing that he would likely face the death penalty for his crimes in Zimbabwe, Swango began talks for a plea agreement. Eventually, prosecutors agreed to not pursue the death penalty or extradition in return for Swango accepting a sentence of life in prison without parole.Swango was formally indicted on July 17, 2000, and pleaded not guilty. On September 6, he pleaded guilty to the three murder counts, as well as counts of wire fraud and mail fraud, before Judge Jacob Mishler. At his sentencing hearing, Swango admitted to causing three murders, lying about his role in causing a fourth death, and lying about his 1985 conviction.Prosecutors read lurid passages from Swango's notebook, describing the joy he felt during his crimes. Judge Mishler sentenced Swango to three consecutive terms of life without parole. He is incarcerated at ADX Florence. He was sent to ADX at his own request; he had been stabbed by another inmate while serving time for lying to the VA, and feared he would be attacked again if he were placed in general population. In his book Blind Eye, Quincy native James B. Stewart estimated that counting the suspicious deaths at SIU, circumstantial evidence links Swango to 35 suspicious deaths. The FBI believes he may be responsible for as many as 60 deaths, which would make him one of the most prolific serial killers in American history.\n\nModus operandi\nSwango rarely changed his murder methods. With non-patients, such as his coworkers at the emergency medical service, he used poisons, usually arsenic, slipping them into foods and beverages. With patients, he sometimes used poisons as well, but usually, he administered an overdose of whichever drug the patient had been prescribed, or wrote unnecessary prescriptions for dangerous drugs.\n\nSee also\nList of serial killers in the United States\nList of medical and pseudo-medical serial killers\nJohn Bodkin Adams – British doctor and suspected serial killer\nH.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nCall for the Dead\nCall for the Dead is John le Carré's first novel, published in 1961. It introduces George Smiley, the most famous of le Carré's recurring characters, in a story about East German spies inside Great Britain.  It also introduces a fictional version of British Intelligence, called \"the Circus\" because of its location in Cambridge Circus, that is apparently based on MI6 and that recurs throughout le Carré's spy novels. Call for the Dead was adapted for film as The Deadly Affair (1966).\n\nPlot summary\nFollowing a wartime excursion undercover in Germany, George Smiley returns to England and marries Lady Ann Sercombe. Although Smiley is a devout husband, Ann is serially unfaithful, and begins an affair with a Cuban racing driver before absconding the country with him. Smiley, infinitely self-controlled and self-deprecating, does nothing, and instead lets Ann continue to utilise their finances whilst he continues to live at their home in Bywater Street in the London borough of Chelsea, distracting himself with a love of German poetry and his work as a member of the Circus, the headquarters of the SIS named after its location on Cambridge Circus.\nSmiley is abruptly summoned in the early hours of the morning by the Circus' advisor, Maston. Unsure about the meeting’s purpose, he travels in via taxi to learn that Foreign Office civil servant Samuel Fennan has killed himself following a routine security check. Smiley, the interviewer, had cleared Fennan, despite only a few days earlier receiving an anonymous letter regarding Fennan's past membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Because Fennan did not have a private office, Smiley had suggested the interview take place in an informal manner on a lunchtime walk through London. Maston informs him that an inquiry will be convened, and begins to set Smiley up for the blame for the suicide.\nSmiley travels to Fennan's home, where he meets Fennan's wife Elsa. Elsa, like her husband, was a Jewish immigrant from Europe following the end of the Second World War, and had been interned in a concentration camp by the Nazis during the course of the war. While at the Fennans' home, Smiley answers a telephone call, believing it to be for him from the Circus. Instead, he finds it is a requested 8:30 am call from the telephone exchange, which Smiley feels is suspicious.\nSmiley meets Inspector Mendel during the course of the interview and investigation. Mendel is on the verge of retirement, and is set to retire once the Fennan case is closed. He obtains information from telephone exchange staff that confirm it was Fennan who had requested the call the night before, furthering Smiley's suspicion around Elsa. Despite this, Maston orders Smiley to refrain from investigating the death any further. Working late at his office the same day, Smiley receives a letter from Fennan from the previous night requesting they meet urgently the next day. Smiley, now believing that Fennan was murdered to prevent a meeting from occurring, writes an abrupt letter of resignation and attaches it to Fennan's letter, leaving it in his out-tray to be forwarded to Maston.\nAfter running some errands, such as going to the dry cleaners, Smiley returns home, but notices movement in the drawing room of his house. He rings his own doorbell, and is met by a tall, fair, handsome stranger. Pretending to be part of a laundrette delivery service, he avoids entering his house, and notes the number plates of the seven cars parked in the road. Now staying with Mendel, who agrees to help him work the case independently, the pair track one car to a dealer called Adam Scarr. Scarr, a semi-professional criminal, tells Mendel that he rents the car out on anonymous agreement to a stranger known as \"Blondie\", who matches the description of Smiley's intruder. However, whilst Mendel and Scarr are conversing, Smiley is attacked whilst tracking \"Blondie's\" car and hospitalised, whilst Scarr is murdered after Mendel's departure.\nNow hospitalised, Smiley directs the case direction from bed rest. Mendel discovers that Elsa attended a local theatre twice a month, in which she liaises with someone the theatre staff believe is her husband. Upon further investigation, this turns out to be \"Blondie\", and Mendel learns that the two always carry music cases to each performance, which they trade. With assistance from fellow Circus agent and Smiley's protégé Peter Guillam, the men learn that \"Blondie\" is actually called Hans-Dieter Mundt, and is an East German agent working undercover as a diplomatic member of the East German Steel Mission for one Dieter Frey. Smiley becomes concerned at this revelation, as Frey was one his operatives during the war. Fanatically opposed to the Nazis, Frey was repeatedly antagonistic about them at great risk to himself. Not only was he a dissident, but he was physically disabled in one leg and needed a cane for most of his life, at a time where the Nazis executed many physically and mentally disabled people. Smiley recommended Frey to the Circus. Frey was later captured by the Nazis and sentenced to a stretch in a political prison camp doing hard labour. Later during the war, Smiley worked directly with Frey as an agent for the Circus. After the war, however, Frey rose through the ranks of East German government service and became one of its most important agents. Smiley also concludes that Frey is likely using a courier service to access only one highly placed domestic agent. Shortly after this revelation, Guillam reports that Mundt has fled to East Germany. He was subsequently identified by cabin crew.\nAfter abruptly discharging himself from hospital, Smiley returns to confront Elsa Fennan. When pushed, she breaks, and confesses that her husband was actually a spy for East Germany, and that she was unwillingly involved in passing secret documents to the East Germans in the music case she took to the theatre. She reveals that Fennan was killed by Mundt after Frey saw him talking to Smiley during their walk through the park, believing that Fennan had cracked under the pressure of passing information to them. When she returned home, she had found Mundt and her husband's corpse, and had typed a suicide note out of fear for her own life.\nGuillam, however, adds another turn to the investigation shortly after this. In an attempt to verify Elsa's claims, he examines the files that Fennan had been taking home from the Foreign Office. On closer inspection, in the period before his death he had been taking home only declassified files of little significance to British security. Smiley then realises that Elsa, not Samuel, is the East German spy, and that the accusation about Fennan had been self-composed in order to allow him to meet someone with whom he could discuss his concerns about his wife.

His most famous novels featured a British spy called Peter Marlow. The first of the series was The Private Sector (1971), set in the Six-Day War. Marlow's story continues in The Sixth Directorate (1975), The Flowers of the Forest (a.k.a. The Oxford Gambit) (1980), and The Valley of the Fox (1982). During his heyday, in the 1970s, Hone was favourably compared with writers such as Len Deighton, Eric Ambler and John le Carré.\n\nEarly life and education\nHone was born in London in 1937, son of Nathaniel Marlow Hone (1917-1959), of South Hill, Killiney, County Dublin, Ireland, and Morley House, Chippenham, Wiltshire, and Bridget, daughter of Michael Anthony, of Diltown, County Kilkenny. The Hone family were Irish landed gentry; his grandfather, Joseph Hone, was biographer to George Moore and W. B. Yeats. Hone recounts having been \"given away\" by his parents and taken to Dublin in his autobiography Wicked Little Joe (2009). He was educated at Kilkenny College and St. Columba's College, Dublin.\n\nCareer\nHone had a varied career, including working as an assistant in a second-hand bookshop in London, as a teacher at Drogheda Grammar School in Ireland, and with the Egyptian Ministry of Education in Cairo, Heliopolis and Suez. He also worked for a publishing firm, and in radio and television. In 1960 he became co-founder of Envoy Productions, Dublin, and co-produced a number of plays and musicals at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, East London. He was appointed Radio and Television Officer with the United Nations Secretariat in New York in 1968 and for the next two years he travelled to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, India, Pakistan and the Far East, producing documentary programmes based on these travels. The Dancing Waiters (1975) was also based on these experiences. He produced a number of radio programmes for U.N. radio, later broadcast by the BBC.\nHone held various positions in radio and television, including radio and then television critic for The Listener (1971–1980), and an overseas posting with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He died on 15 August 2016.\n\nNovels\nIn his first novel, The Private Sector (1971), Marlow, a teacher in Cairo, finds himself becoming a spy for the British. This was based in part on Hone's experiences in 1957–58 as a teacher in Europe. He stated that he had not been associated with Intelligence work but that he had 'worked with and met such people, especially while I was a teacher in Egypt and in New York with the UN.' Hone's second book, The Sixth Directorate (1975), continues Marlow's story after his release from Durham jail, where he has been sent on a frame-up by his own Department; it deals with his impersonation of an Englishman, a captured KGB agent living in London, his subsequent adventures as a fall-guy agent in the UN in New York, and his eventual encounter with the KGB in Cheltenham. Hone's last novel was Goodbye Again. Hone's books, including his last novel, have been translated into various languages, including French.\nHone reviewed books for the New York Times Book Review, The Spectator, The New Statesman, and the Daily Telegraph.Since 2000, Hone had been teaching creative writing and a course which looked at the history and culture of various countries, including India and China. He taught at Wroxton College in Oxfordshire, part of Fairleigh Dickinson University based in New Jersey, USA.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1964, Hone married Jacqueline, daughter of J. M. Yeend, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The Hones had two children. Hone's brother, Camillus, was adopted by the writer Pamela Travers, the creator of Mary Poppins.\n\nBibliography\nNovels\nThe Private Sector [1971]\nThe Sixth Directorate [1975]\nThe Paris Trap [1977]\nThe Flowers of the Forest [1980], ISBN 978-0436200878, published in the U.S. as The Oxford Gambit\nThe Valley of the Fox [1982]\nSummer Hill [1990]\nReturn to Summer Hill [1990]\nFiresong [1997]\nGoodbye Again [2011]\n\nNon-fiction\nThe Dancing Waiters [1975]\nGone Tomorrow [1981]\nChildren of the Country: Coast to Coast Across Africa [1986]\nDuck Soup in the Black Sea [1988]\nWicked Little Joe [2009] ISBN 978-1843511472\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMerck &amp; Co.\nMerck & Co., Inc. is an American multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Rahway, New Jersey, and is named for Merck Group, founded in Germany in 1668, of whom it was once the American arm. The company does business as Merck Sharp & Dohme or MSD outside the United States and Canada. It is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, generally ranking in the global top five by revenue.Merck & Co. was originally established as the American affiliate of Merck Group in 1891. Merck develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. It has multiple blockbuster drugs or products each with 2020 revenues including cancer immunotherapy, anti-diabetic medication and vaccines against HPV and chickenpox.\nThe company is ranked 71st on the 2022 Fortune 500 and 87th on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000, both based on 2021 revenues.\n\nProducts\nThe company develops medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. In 2020, the company had 6 blockbuster drugs or products, each with over $1 billion in revenue: Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy that had $14.3 billion in 2020 revenue; Januvia (sitagliptin), an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes that had $5.3 billion in 2020 revenue; Gardasil, an HPV vaccine that had $3.9 billion in 2020 revenue; Varivax, a varicella vaccine used to protect against chickenpox that had $1.9 billion in 2020 revenues; Bridion (Sugammadex), a neuromuscular-blocking drug that had $1.2 billion in 2020 revenue; and Pneumovax 23, a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine that had $1.1 billion in 2020 revenue. Other major products by the company include Isentress (raltegravir), an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS that had $857 million in 2020 revenue; Simponi (golimumab), a human monoclonal antibody used as an immunosuppressive drug that had $838 million in 2020 revenue; RotaTeq, a rotavirus vaccine that had $797 million in 2020 revenue; and Lynparza (olaparib), a medication for the maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer in adults that generated $725 million in 2020 revenue for the company.Details of Merck's major products are as follows:\n\nJanuvia (sitagliptin) is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes. Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.\nZetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.\nRemicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers. Merck had rights to the drug in certain areas, while Janssen Biotech had rights in other areas; in 2017, Merck announced a biosimilar to Remicade, Renflexis.\nGardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.\nIsentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\nKeytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment. In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.\nInvanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic drug version in the United States. Savior has since obtained approval to market generic ertapenem.\nMexsana is an antiseptic medicated powder.\nMectizan (ivermectin) is an anti-parasitic medicine traditionally used to treat river blindness. It is the focus of Merck's Mectizan Donation Program, wherein Merck has donated doses of the drug to treat millions of people in countries such as Yemen and African nations.\nMolnupiravir is an antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nursationic rosin size. Basis of AKD -technology Hercules acquired more or less voluntary from German BASF after the Second World War.\n\nVentures\nVentures produces specialty chemicals for a variety of markets, including adhesives and sealants, paints, inks, coatings, lubricants, rubber, plastics, and building and construction.\nHercules Incorporated, in collaboration with Professor Kaichang Li of Oregon State University and Columbia Forest Products, received a 2007 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for the Greener Synthetic Pathways category in developing and commercializing a formaldehyde-free adhesive made from soy flour and Hercules' unique polymer chemistries.\n\nSee also\nTekoi, a former solid fuel rocket motor test and calibration site operated by Hercules Aerospace\nPassage 5:\nDoravirine\nDoravirine, sold under the brand name Pifeltro, is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor medication developed by Merck & Co. for use in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.\nDoravirine was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2018.\nPassage 6:\nLiquid Assets Paint &amp; Pigment Company\nLiquid Assets Paint & Pigment Company is an artist supply company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina that manufactures acrylic paints and pigments created with real currency, such as Euro, US Dollar, Argentine Peso, and Romanian Leu. The Company's slogan \"The Price of Art\" refers to the company's assertion that its products allow fine artists to quantify the precise and actual value of a work of art created using Liquid Assets products. The company was started in 2007 by a group of Buenos Aires–based professional artists and presently operates a manufacturing plant in Buenos Aires, as well as a retail store in the Palermo Soho neighborhood. In September 2010, Liquid Assets opened a temporary pop up store in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood in conjunction with the Swervewolf Experience marketing and design firm. Although artists have used valuable commodities such as gold leaf to create works of art for centuries, such as gilding, Liquid Assets Paint & Pigment Company is the world's only known manufacturer of artist paint and pigment created with actual currency.\nPassage 7:\nNew England Emigrant Aid Company\nThe New England Emigrant Aid Company (originally the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company) was a transportation company founded in Boston, Massachusetts by activist Eli Thayer in the wake of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed the population of Kansas Territory to choose whether slavery would be legal. The Company's ultimate purpose was to transport anti-slavery immigrants into the Kansas Territory. The Company believed that if enough anti-slavery immigrants settled en masse in the newly-opened territory, they would be able to shift the balance of political power in the territory, which in turn would lead to Kansas becoming a free state (rather than a slave state) when it eventually joined the United States.The Company is noted less for its direct impact than for the psychological impact it had on proslavery and abolitionist groups. Thayer's prediction that the Company would eventually be able to send 20,000 immigrants a year never came to fruition, but it spurred border ruffians from nearby Missouri, where slavery was legal, to move to Kansas to ensure its admission to the Union as a slave state. That, in turn, further galvanized Free-Staters and other enemies of the Slave Power.\nThayer's intention was to capitalize on anti-slavery sentiment in the Northern United States and to send settlers to Kansas to purchase land and build houses, shops, and mills. They could then sell the land at a significant profit and send the proceeds back to Thayer and his investors. At the behest of several investors, who found the notion of profiting from the anti-slavery cause distasteful, the company's model was shifted to that of a benevolent society, and it was renamed the New England Emigrant Aid Company in 1855. While the company achieved neither a profit nor a significant impact on the population of Kansas, it played an important role in the events that would later be termed Bleeding Kansas.\n\nCreation\nThe Company was formed in the midst of the sectional crisis that preceded the American Civil War. To the Northern United States, the concept of popular sovereignty, which stated that the population of each new U.S. state should be allowed to decide if it allowed slavery, was an attempt by Southerners to gain power. When the Kansas–Nebraska Act threatened to extend popular sovereignty into the new Kansas Territory, Eli Thayer, a second-term Congressman from Massachusetts, hatched the idea of an Emigrant Aid Company in the winter of 1853–1854. His primary partners in the venture were Alexander H. Bullock and Edward Everett Hale, and together, they set Thayer's plans in motion on March 5, 1854. Thayer announced the Company at a rally against the impending passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in Worcester on March 11. Shortly thereafter, the Company's charter was approved by the Massachusetts Legislature for up to $5,000,000 in capital.Officially, the Company was a profit-making venture, and how the settlers voted was of no consequence to the company. For example, the company secretary, Thomas Webb released a pamphlet in 1855 stating that although the settlers sent to the territories would not be required to vote for one side or the other, they were expected to support the free-state movement. A number of abolitionists questioned the profit motive behind the company, and even many of Thayer's potential investors balked at the notion \"that people might say we were influenced by pecuniary considerations in our patriotic work.\" Although Thayer personally disagreed with such hesitations, in 1855 the Company reorganized as a benevolent society and changed its name to the New England Emigrant Aid Company.\n\nReaction\nThe success of the endeavor prompted other aid assistance companies to form back East, in New York and Ohio, with new companies such as the Worcester County Emigrant Aid Society.\n\nImpact\nThe company was directly responsible for creating the Kansas towns of Lawrence and Manhattan, and it played a key role in founding Topeka and Osawatomie. Lawrence was named after the Company secretary, Amos Adams Lawrence. Multiple politicians were found in the emigrants who left for Kansas, such as Daniel Read Anthony, Charles L. Robinson, Samuel C. Pomeroy, and Martin F. Conway, who would later be Kansas's first US Representative.\nThe exact number of people who left for Kansas is unknown. James Rawley puts the numbers somewhere around 2000, about a third of whom returned home, but the Kansas Historical Society puts the number at around 900 for those who left for Kansas in 1855 alone.The Company's mission was ultimately successful, and Kansas entered the United States as a free state in 1861.\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nKody Lostroh\nKody Lostroh (born September 18, 1985) is an American former professional rodeo cowboy who specialized in bull riding. He was the 2009 Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world champion.\n\nBackground\nKody Lostroh was born on September 18, 1985 in Longmont, Colorado. Lostroh watched a video of Cheyenne Frontier Days so many times that his mother Dena Schlutz signed him up to ride at the Boulder County Fair in 1993, when he was seven years old. He won a Little Britches Rodeo National Bull Riding title in 2003 and the Colorado High School Rodeo Bull Riding Championship three consecutive years. Kody was attending the University of Wyoming, but quit after a semester to pursue the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour.\n\nCareer\nIn 2005, Lostroh won the PBR Rookie of the Year award and in 2009, he won the PBR Built Ford Tough Series World Championship. He qualified for the PBR World Finals 10 consecutive times (2005 to 2014). Lostroh suffered multiple injuries throughout his career. For example, Lostroh injured his riding hand in January 2014 and missed most of the first half of that season. In August 2017, he was considering retirement to spend more time with his two daughters, when he began experiencing significant health problems. He was eventually diagnosed with a tumor wrapped around his carotid artery, requiring surgery. He went back to the PBR but still had some reservations.On March 29, 2018, Lostroh announced his retirement from bull riding.In 2022, Lostroh became the assistant coach to head coach Cord McCoy of the Oklahoma Freedom; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBR’s Team Series, which debuted that year. In September of that year, the Oklahoma Freedom won the event at Cowboy Days in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the hometown event of rival team, the Carolina Cowboys. The very next weekend, the Freedom won their own hometown event at Freedom Fest in Oklahoma City. They were the first team to win their hometown event. The Freedom ended up finishing in fourth place at the conclusion of the inaugural PBR Team Series season.\n\nPersonal life\nHe raises bucking bulls in Ault, Colorado, at the Shield of Faith Cattle Company. As of 2016, Lostroh and his wife, Candace, who is a barrel racer, live in Ault, Colorado, with their two daughters.\nPassage 2:\nBones (bull)\nBones #05 (born March 31, 2003) is an American former bucking bull. He competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuit and was the PBR World Champion Bull in 2008 and 2010. Two other bulls, Dillinger and Smooth Operator, have also won the title two times. Three other bulls, Little Yellow Jacket, Bushwacker, and Bruiser won the award three times. In 2011, the year after Bones won the 2010 World Champion Bull title, when he was 7 years old, his owner, Tom Teague announced his retirement from the sport. Bones lives on Teague's ranch in his retirement. In 2014, the bull was inducted into the PBR Brand of Honor.\n\nBackground\nBones was born on March 31, 2003. Bones grew up at Teague Bucking Bulls in Graham, North Carolina. Teague was the 2006 PBR Co-Stock Contractor of the Year.  Bones got his name when one of Tom Teague's workers described him as a \"bag of bones.\" Lee Holt said, \"He was the poorest little thing.\" He was too small to take care of himself with the other calves so they moved him to be alone in the barn. Through the years, he grew into a brawny 1,550 pounds (700 kg) pounds. He is a black bull with a white face.Bones' sire was 263 Bone Collector. Bone Collector's jumping prowess while bucking was well known. Bones' paternal grandsire was 64 Psycho. His mother is a daughter of Whitewater, a well-known breeding bull. Whitewater's sire was No. 34 Oscar's Velvet, the 1983 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. Oscar's Velvet was the son of Oscar, a ProRodeo Hall of Fame bucking bull. Bones is also a half-brother of the retired and highly ranked bucking bull Troubadour owned by Julio Moreno.Teague raised Bones and retained full ownership of the bull throughout his bucking career and into retirement. This was not the first time Teague had ownership in a World Champion Bull, as he also had part ownership in world champion bulls Little Yellow Jacket, Mossy Oak Mudslinger, and Big Bucks, including gaining full ownership of Little Yellow Jacket for most of his retirement. This was, however, the first time Teague retained full ownership in a bull that he raised himself. He intended to keep Teague Bucking Bulls continuing in that direction, but decided in April 2014 to leave the stock contractor business. However, in an interview with the PBR, Teague stated that he would continue his position on the board of directors and aid them in \"taking the sport to the next level.\"\n\nCareer\nOne of the ways that Teague exercised Bones was in a circular sand pit that he had made, where he installed a type of hot walker sometimes used for horses. Once an animal was inside, there were walls that moved around in a circular direction, forcing the bull to walk in between them. Teague compared working in deep sand to walking on the beach – it took more effort than walking on hard ground.Bones bucked in the PBR, mostly on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS), the elite series of the circuit, for four seasons, but only three were complete seasons, as he only bucked at one BFTS event in 2007. Two-time PBR World Champion bull rider Justin McBride stated that Bones is the \"real deal\". He said Bones is one of only two bulls he got on more than once who bucked him off each time—he never got a qualified ride on Bones. McBride first got on the bull at an event at Columbus, Ohio, in 2008 when Bones was a fairly unknown five-year-old. Bones bucked him off.\n\n2008 title\nBones qualified for the PBR World Finals his first time in 2008. McBride again picked him in round two and Bones bucked him off faster than in their first meeting. According to McBride, Bones had gotten better and \"handed him his hat\". Bones bucked off all three riders at his first finals. Bones made what became his trademarkSelf are divided into two parts: family papers and personal and literary papers.

He was the 2008 PBR World Champion.\n\nBackground\nMarchi is 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m) tall and weighs 198 pounds (90 kg). He is from Leme, São Paulo, and is of Italian descent on his father's side. He rode his bulls right-handed. His special interests include soccer, team roping, and surfing.\n\nCareer\nMarchi competed very briefly in the Championship Bull Riding (CBR) tour in 2004 before joining the PBR full-time. He debuted late in the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) season that year, qualifying for his first-ever PBR World Finals and finishing 41st in the world. After finishing in the runner-up position for the PBR World Championship in three consecutive years, he won his world title in 2008. Statistically, Marchi was one of the most consistent riders on the tour. He would go on to qualify for the World Finals all 15 years of his PBR career (2004 to 2018).In 2005, Guilherme Marchi was the biggest threat to Justin McBride’s dream of being the PBR World Champion. McBride won, Marchi came in second. However, Marchi was the PBR World Finals event champion that year. \nIn 2006, during one of the last few regular-season BFTS events before the World Finals, Marchi won $90,000 by successfully riding Scene of the Crash in the Mossy Oak Shootout in Greensboro, North Carolina. At the World Finals, Marchi once again failed to win when fellow Brazilian Adriano Moraes came from behind to claim the PBR world championship, with Marchi placing second. \nYet again, in 2007, Marchi finished the season in the number two position behind Justin McBride at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas.In 2008, Marchi dominated the PBR circuit, riding nearly 75% of his bulls, winning five events, and earning over $1.5 million (nearly three times as much as any other PBR rider) on his way to his PBR world championship title and the $1 million bonus that went with it.In March 2014, in the opening round of the BFTS event in Phoenix, Arizona, Marchi became the first bull rider to successfully complete 500 qualified rides in the PBR, riding Pandora’s Pyxis.On April 8, 2017, Marchi rode Shocker for 86.25 points in Round 2 of the BFTS event in Billings, Montana. In doing so, he became the first PBR rider to reach 600 qualified rides and received a commemorative belt buckle.On August 12, 2018, Marchi announced that 2018 would be his final year of bull riding, with the intention of retiring after the PBR World Finals. He finished his professional career with 635 qualified rides (the most ever in PBR history), 36 PBR event wins, and over $5.3 million in career earnings.Marchi officially retired from bull riding following his victory at the 2018 PBR Brazil event in Goiânia, Goiás.In 2023, Marchi became the assistant coach to head coach J.W. Hart of the Kansas City Outlaws; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBR’s Team Series, which debuted the previous year and holds events in the United States from the summer through autumn. Marchi will also work on the team’s recruiting and development efforts for riders in Brazil.\n\nHonors\nOn November 5, 2019, Marchi was inducted into the PBR Ring of Honor.On May 14, 2022, Marchi was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame.\n\nPersonal\nOn April 19, 2018, Marchi married long-time girlfriend Maria in Texas.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBeth Turner\nBeth P. Turner (born May 13, 1958 in Maine) is an American politician who served as a member of the Maine House of Representatives for the 141st district from 2011 to 2018. She was first elected on March 1, 2011, in a special election following the death of Rep. Everett McLeod in December 2010.\nTurner served on the MSAD 31 School Board and the Select Board in her hometown of Burlington, Maine prior to her election the House of Representatives.\nPassage 2:\nSan Diego mayoral special election, 2005\nThe 2005 San Diego mayoral special election was a special election held on Tuesday, November 8, 2005, to elect the mayor for San Diego. The special election was necessary due to the resignation of former Mayor Dick Murphy.\nMunicipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties. The non-partisan special primary was held Tuesday, June 3, 2008. San Diego City Council member Donna Frye and former San Diego police chief Jerry Sanders received the most votes and advanced to the November special general election. Sanders was elected mayor with a majority of the votes in November.\n\nDick Murphy resignation\nOn April 25, 2005, Dick Murphy announced that he would resign as mayor of San Diego, effective July 15, 2005. Murphy had only recently been reelected as mayor in the highly contested 2004 mayoral election. Murphy's resignation occurred during investigations by the SEC and the FBI into the San Diego pension scandal.  The city held a special election to fill the vacancy at mayor. Following Murphy's resignation, Michael Zucchet served as acting mayor for three days before he too resigned due to a corruption conviction that was later overturned. Council member Toni Atkins then served as acting mayor until the mayoral election was complete.\n\nCandidates\nDeclared\nJerry Sanders, former San Diego police chief  (Voter registration: Republican)\nDonna Frye, city council member (Voter registration: Democratic)\nSteve Francis, businessman (Voter registration: Republican)\nPat Shea, lawyer (Voter registration: Republican)\nRichard Rider, retired stock broker and financial planner (Voter registration: Libertarian)\nMyke Shelby, Harley Davidson dealer (Voter registration: Republican)\nShawn A. McMillan, lawyer (Voter registration: Republican)\nJim Bell, environmental designer (Party preference: Democratic)\nEd Kolker\nJeremy Ledford\nThomas Knapp\n\nCampaign\nThe special election to replace Murphy attracted a crowded field of eleven official candidates on the ballot. Donna Frye, a member of the San Diego City Council who had almost beaten Murphy with a write-in campaign in the 2004 election, was the only democrat among the top-tier candidates. Former police chief Jerry Sanders ran on a platform of executive experience, having successfully turn around the financial situations of the local chapters of the Red Cross and United Way since retiring as police chief. Steve Francis, founder and chairman of AMN Healthcare Services emphasized downsizing city government and implementing business principles. Francis outspent his rivals in the campaign, putting nearly $2 million of his own money into his campaign. Lawyer Pat Shea ran on a platform that San Diego should declare bankruptcy to deal with the pension scandal, a position that the other front runners disagreed with.Frye won the plurality of votes in the July primary and advanced to the general election along with runner-up Sanders. However, Sanders and third-place finisher Francis, both republicans, combined for a majority of votes cast in the primary. After conceding the primary election, Francis endorsed Sanders for the general election.  Sanders was elected mayor with a majority of the votes in the November general election.\n\nPrimary election\nPolling\nResults\nGeneral election\nPolling\nResults\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nDavid Jacoby\nDavid or Dave Jacoby may refer to:\n\nDavid Jacoby (politician)\nDavid Jacoby (sportscaster)\nDave Jacoby (powerlifter)\nDavid Jacoby (historian)\nPassage 4:\nGreg Gianforte\nGregory Richard Gianforte ( JEE-ən-FOR-tay; born April 17, 1961) is an American businessman, politician, software engineer, and writer serving as the 25th governor of Montana since 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Gianforte served as the U.S. representative for Montana's at-large congressional district from 2017 to 2021.\nIn 1997, Gianforte and his wife, Susan, co-founded RightNow Technologies, a customer relationship management software company. The company went public in 2004; by that time, it employed over 1,000 workers. RightNow Technologies was acquired by Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.In 2016, Gianforte ran for governor of Montana as the Republican nominee, losing to incumbent governor Steve Bullock. In May 2017, Gianforte defeated Democratic nominee Rob Quist in a special election for Montana's at-large congressional seat to fill a vacancy created by the appointment of Ryan Zinke as U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Gianforte was convicted of assault in state court in June 2017 stemming from his election-eve body-slamming attack on The Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs in May 2017. He was fined and sentenced to community service and anger management therapy. Gianforte was reelected in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee Kathleen Williams.\nGianforte did not seek reelection to the House of Representatives in 2020 and instead was a candidate in the 2020 Montana gubernatorial election. In the November general election, he defeated incumbent lieutenant governor Mike Cooney. He is the first Republican to serve as governor of Montana since Judy Martz left office in 2005.\n\nEarly life and education\nGregory Richard Gianforte was born on April 17, 1961, in San Diego, California. He is the oldest son of Frank Richard Gianforte, who had a career as an aerospace engineer and, later, as a landlord. His mother, Dale Douglass, worked for General Dynamics in San Diego, and later was a school math teacher. Gianforte is of Italian, English, and Scottish ancestry. He has two younger brothers, Douglass and Michael. After the age of three, Gianforte was raised in the Valley Forge and King of Prussia suburbs northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, including Wayne, an affluent unincorporated township community that extends into Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware Counties.During his high school years in the 1970s, Gianforte started a software business. He attended Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where he was elected classs resignation to become Mayor of Fall River, Massachusetts.From 2002 to 2009, Aguiar served as a member of the Fall School Committee. He was defeated for re-election in the 2012 Democratic primary by challenger Alan Silvia, who succeeded him.\nPassage 8:\nMike Aguirre\nJules Michael Aguirre (born 1949), more commonly known as Michael Jules Aguirre, was the City Attorney for the City of San Diego, California, from 2004 to 2008.\nIn 2013, he was a candidate for mayor in a special election following Mayor Bob Filner's resignation. He lost to Kevin Faulconer, placing fourth in a field of eleven candidates.\n\nEarly life\nAguirre was born to Julio and Margaret Aguirre. His father was of Spanish and Mexican descent and his mother is of Mexican descent.\n\nEarly career\nAguirre worked as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Department of Justice and directed a grand jury investigation of pension racketeering. He was then appointed as assistant counsel to the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. After leaving government work, Aguirre set up his own firm specializing in securities fraud.In the 1990s, Aguirre continued his securities practice and his electoral campaigns. In 1990, Aguirre allied with the Chicano Movement to file a successful federal voting rights lawsuit to overturn San Diego’s redistricting. In 1993, Aguirre successfully defended the United Farm Workers Union in Yuma, Arizona, in a case with lettuce grower Bruce Church. Aguirre took over the defense of the case after UFW President Cesar Chavez died following two days of testimony. Aguirre finished the jury trial, which the UFW lost, but he succeeded in getting the case overturned on appeal.In 1996, Aguirre went to court to throw out a 1995 contract between the City of San Diego and the San Diego Chargers football team. In the contract, the city agreed to issue $60 million of bonds to renovate the football team's stadium, and, in a controversial clause, promised to constantly maintain the stadium as a state-of-the-art venue. The city had also agreed to guarantee the sale of 60,000 game tickets at prices to be set by the Chargers. Aguirre’s suit and the ensuing scandal surrounding the maintenance clause compelled the city to renegotiate with the Chargers in 1998.\n\nCity Attorney\nAguirre ran for San Diego City Attorney in 2004, in the midst of a financial crisis and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Scandal had erupted in the summer of 2003 over a pension deal that municipal employees received between 1996 and 2002. Workers were given increased benefits during this period, but the city did not contribute enough to municipal pension funds to cover the increased benefits. The resulting deficit of some $1.4 billion left the city’s finances in shambles and made it virtually impossible to issue municipal bonds. Aguirre ran as a \"clean up the mess\" outsider, with support from Democrats in the officially nonpartisan race, and won with 50.4% of the vote. A 2008 Wall Street Journal article praised Aguirre’s efforts to address the City of San Diego's hundreds of millions of dollars of unfunded pension liabilities.In October 2007, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that during the California wildfires of October 2007, Aguirre had called for an evacuation of the entire City of San Diego. Aguirre was heavily criticized for the idea but said that the paper had distorted his position. Aguirre's claim was that he had written a memo to the San Diego Mayor at the height of the fires, advising that the city should draw up a voluntary evacuation plan in light of federal regulations, the immediate threat of the fire, as well as concerns over weather conditions and air quality.As City Attorney, Aguirre filed a legal action to force a developer to reduce the height of an already constructed office building near an airport. Federal Aviation Administration officials had later determined that the height of the building posed a threat to public safety, even if a city building permit had been issued. In 2009, a California Superior Court judge affirmed the City Attorney's position by determining the developer had no legal right to erect the building to the unsafe height, and the top several stories were ordered to be removed from the building.In 2005, immediately upon taking office, Aguirre attempted unsuccessfully to overturn a city grant of $900 million in pension benefits to police and other city workers, which Aguirre contended had been illegal.Aguirre sued Countrywide Financial in July 2008 over lending practices  and convinced a federal multi-district litigation judicial panel to move all Countrywide Financial foreclosure cases to the jurisdiction of the City of San Diego.\nIn 2008, Aguirre ran for a second term as City Attorney but was challenged by several other candidates. The president of the San Diego City Council Scott Peters ran with the backing of city unions, while Superior Court Judge Jan Goldsmith was backed by the Republican political establishment. In the five-candidate nonpartisan primary election in June 2008, Aguirre qualified for the general election by coming in second place after Goldsmith. In the general election on November 4, 2008, Aguirre lost to Goldsmith: 59.5 percent to 40.5 percent.\n\nAfter leaving office\nAfter leaving his post as City Attorney, Aguirre returned to private legal practice by forming the law firm of Aguirre Morris & Severson, along with two colleagues from the City Attorney's office: Mia Severson, who had headed the City Attorney's civil litigation division; and Chris Morris, who had headed the City's Criminal Division. Aguirre also started the National Center for Regulatory Reform, which has issued extensive reports on the Market Crash of 2008.\nFollowing the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner in August 2013, Aguirre declared his intention to run in the special election for mayor to replace him. In the primary election held November 19, 2013, Aguirre came in a distant fourth with 4.44 percent of the vote, and thus did not advance to the runoff election held in November.In 2014, Aguirre represented a woman named Ruth Hendricks who was challenging the $4.7 billion settlement deal for the failed San Onofre nuclear plant in San Diego County. His questions during the settlement approval process were not addressed. By 2015, his questions about backchannel dealings between regulators and utility companies were being taken more seriously, as criminal investigators seized notes from a secret meeting in Poland where the framework of a San Onofre deal was first discussed.\n\nElectoral history\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThe Red Queen's Race\nThe Red Queen's Race is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov; it uses the Red Queen's race from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass as a metaphor for the final plot twist.  The story also makes reference to Asimov's psychohistory.  \"The Red Queen's Race\" was first published in the January 1949 issue of Astounding Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1972 collection The Early Asimov.\n\"The Red Queen's Race\" was written in July 1948, a month after Asimov received a PhD from Columbia University and became a postdoc studying anti-malarial drugs.\n\nPlot summary\nThe story is told by an unnamed narrator, an agent of an unnamed U.S. intelligence bureau. The agent is tasked with an investigation into an atomic power plant which has been completely drained of power. A Professor of Nuclear Physics, Elmer Tywood, is found dead.\nAs the investigation progresses, bringing in Tywood's research students and his university colleagues, it is revealed that Tywood had developed a means to send objects back in time via \"micro-temporal translation.\" His plan was to \"improve\" the world by giving Hellenic Greece advanced knowledge in the form of chemistry.\nThe investigating agents and their superior, The Boss, gradually realize that the changes introduced into history might, through the butterfly effect, cause the deletion from existence of every human being alive.\nThe trail eventually leads to the doorstep of Mycroft James Boulder, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, who had been hired by Tywood to translate a textbook of chemistry into Attic Greek. He states that he had figured out Tywood's plan and translated only enough to coincide with historical accounts.\nWith no clear solution, the investigation is shelved and filed under the heading of \"?\".\nPassage 2:\nThrough the Looking-Glass\nThrough the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (also known as Alice Through the Looking-Glass or simply Through the Looking-Glass) is a novel published on 27 December 1871 (though indicated as 1872) by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics professor at the University of Oxford, and the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. There she finds that, just like a reflection, everything is reversed, including logic (for example, running helps one remain stationary, walking away from something brings one towards it, chessmen are alive, nursery rhyme characters exist, and so on).\nThrough the Looking-Glass includes such verses as \"Jabberwocky\" and \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The mirror above the fireplace that is displayed at Hetton Lawn in Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire (a house that was owned by Alice Liddell's grandparents, and was regularly visited by Alice and Lewis Carroll) resembles the one drawn by John Tenniel and is cited as a possible inspiration for Carroll.  It prompted a newfound appreciation for its predecessor when it was published.\n\nPlot summary\nChapter One – Looking-Glass House: Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls \"Snowdrop\") and a black kitten (whom she calls \"Kitty\") when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up onto the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, \"Jabberwocky\", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.\n\nChapter Two – The Garden of Live Flowers: Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak; they perceive Alice as being a \"flower that can move about\". Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds.\nChapter Three – Looking-Glass Insects: The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She arrives in a forest where a depressed gnat teaches her about the looking glass insects, strange creatures part bug part object (e.g., bread and butterfly, rocking horse fly), before flying away sadly. Alice continues her journey and along the way, crosses the \"wood where things have no names\". There she forgets all nouns, including her own name. With the help of a fawn who has also forgotten his identity, she makes it to the other side, where they both remember everything. Realizing that he is a fawn, she is a human, and that fawns are afraid of humans, it runs off (to Alice's frustration).\n\nChapter Four – Tweedledum and Tweedledee: She then meets the fat twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the nursery rhyme. After reciting the long poem \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", they draw Alice's attention to the Red King—loudly snoring away under a nearby tree—and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King's dreams. Finally, the brothers begin suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts.\nChapter Five – Wool and Water: Alice next meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about \"crabs\" and \"feathers\".\nChapter Six – Humpty Dumpty: After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in \"Jabberwocky\". In the process, he introduces Alice to the concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.\n\nChapter Seven – The Lionweekends and five in total. Japan was the film's highest-grossing country after North America, with $133.7 million, followed by the UK, Ireland and Malta ($64.4 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($45.9 million).\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 51% of 278 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus is: \"Tim Burton's Alice sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence—and much of its heart—but it's an undeniable visual treat\". According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 53 out of 100 based on 38 reviews, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.Todd McCarthy of Variety praised it for its \"moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement\", but went on to say, \"But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter said \"Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks\", while as well praising its computer-generated imagery (CGI), saying \"Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton's endlessly fertile imagination.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D Alice in Wonderland, written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, \"Alice plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails.\"Several reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a \"colonialist entrepreneur\" at the end of the film setting sail for China. Given Britain's role in the First and Second Opium Wars during the Victorian era and the foreign domination of China through \"unequal treaties\", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, \"Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century.\"Game developer American McGee, best known for creating Alice and Alice: Madness Returns, was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton's interpretation of the title character since both versions share a similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland. McGee praised the film's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters. He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a \"tool\".\n\nAccolades\nAt the 83rd Academy Awards, the film received three nominations: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Visual Effects and won the former two. At the 64th British Academy Film Awards, the film received five nominations and won two awards for Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair. The film received three nominations at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Johnny Depp, but did not win any. It further received nominations for five Satellite Awards and Saturn Awards each (winning two of them), four Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two), and a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nLegacy\nFollowing its release, the film drove about $1.6 billion in retail sales for Disney, including home video and merchandise sales.After the release and success of the movie, Walt Disney Pictures has announced the development of several live-action adaptations of their Animated Classics series. With the exception of Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp, Mulan,Pinocchio, and Peter Pan & Wendy; The Lion King, Maleficent, Aladdin, Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, and Christopher Robin have all followed to similar box-office results with the latter four also earning critical praise. Disney has also announced the development of live-action adaptations of Fantasia, The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Lilo & Stitch, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Bambi, Robin Hood, Hercules, The Aristocats, and Moana. The company also released Cruella, a live-action spin-off of One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and has plans for live-action spin-offs of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Peter Pan along with a live-action prequel to Aladdin.Walt Disney Theatrical was in early talks with Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who had previously written stage adaptions of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aida, and Lestat, to develop the property as a Broadway musical set to premiere in London. Rob Ashford was attached to direct and choreograph. As of 2013, no further developments had been made.\n\nSequel\nOn December 7, 2012, Variety announced the development of a sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Linda Woolverton returned to write a screenplay. On May 31, 2013, James Bobin began talks to direct the sequel under the working title Alice in Wonderland: Into the Looking Glass. Johnny Depp returned as The Hatter, Mia Wasikowska reprised the role of Alice, and Helena Bonham Carter returned as the Red Queen. Several other cast members from the 2010 film also reprised their roles in the sequel. On November 22, 2013, it was announced that the sequel will be released on May 27, 2016, and that Bobin would direct the film. Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen are featured in the film. On January 21, 2014, the film was again retitled to Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSiberian roe deer\nThe Siberian roe deer, eastern roe deer, or Asian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), is a species of roe deer found in northeastern Asia. In addition to Siberia and Mongolia, it is found in Kazakhstan, the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan, eastern Tibet, the Korean Peninsula, and northern China.\nIts specific name pygargus, literally \"white-rumped\", is shared by the pygarg, an antelope known in antiquity. The name was chosen by the German biologist Peter Simon Pallas in the late 18th century. The Siberian roe deer has long antlers.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe Siberian roe deer was once considered to be the same species as the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), but it is now considered to be a separate species.\nThe two subspecies of the Siberian roe deer are C. p. pygargus and C. p. tianschanicus (the latter is named for the Tian Shan mountains).\n\nDescription\nThe Siberian roe deer is a medium-sized metacarpalian deer, with a long neck and large ears. It is typically up to 146 cm (4.8 ft) in body length and 59 kg (130 lb) in weight, making it larger than C. capreolus where populations from Ural and Northern Kazakhstan are the largest on average, followed by those from Transbaikal, Amur, and Primolskil regions. It has larger antlers with more branches than those of European roe deer. Siberian roe deer generally live about 8–12 years, with a maximum of about 18 years. In winter the northern populations exhibit light gray coloring, but their southern counterparts are grayish brown and ochraceous. The belly is creamy and the caudal patch is white. In the summer, their coloring is reddish. Young have a spotted coat. Males are larger and have three-tined antlers, widely spaced and slanting upward, which are shed in the autumn or early winter and begin to regrow shortly thereafter.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nSiberian roe deer are found within the temperate zone of Eastern Europe and Central and East Asia. Fossil records show their territory once stretched to the northern Caucasus Mountains, as well as eastern Ukraine. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, their range was diminished by overhunting in Eastern Europe, northern Kazakhstan, western Siberia, and the northern regions of eastern Siberia. Due to a division in their range, two morphologically different subspecies resulted (Tian Shan and Siberian).  The Siberian and European roe deer meet at the Caucasus Mountains with the Siberian roe deer occupying the northern flank, and the European roe deer occupying the southern flank, Asia Minor, and parts of northwestern Iran.\nThe Siberian roe deer has a light, slender build adapted for tall, dense grass. They live in forest and steppe habitats and develop high densities in tall-grass meadows and floodplains. They are adapted to severe weather extremes.It may have become naturalized in England for a short period in the early 20th century as an escapee from Woburn, but it was extirpated by 1945.\n\nEcology\nDiet\nThe diet of the Siberian roe deer consists of over 600 species of plants – mostly herbaceous dicotyledons (58%), monocotyledons (16%), and woody species (22%). In winter, without proper sustenance, they have a lowered metabolic rate. In summer, their dietary need for sodium necessitates visits to natural salt licks. Water is usually obtained through moisture-rich foods as opposed to directly from the source.\n\nBehavior\nSiberian roe deer can jump distances up to 15 m (49 ft), and mating occurs in August and September. Female Siberian roe deer are the only ungulates to undergo embryonic diapause. Embryonic implantation takes place in January and gestation lasts 280–300 days. Females usually have two young at a time, which are weaned after 4–5 months. Females reach sexual maturity in their first year of age but usually do not breed until their second. Males usually mate in their third year of life. The life-span of the Siberian roe deer does not usually exceed 10 years.Males mark their territory with olfactory marks, using secretion glands on the head skin, which they rub against trees, shrubs, and high grasses, or with visual marks, by fraying trees with their antlers. Vocal signals are also a form of communication in Siberian roe deer. They have six signals: squeaking or whistling, rasping, barking, whining, screaming, and nonvocal sounds.Some Siberian roe deer perform mass migrations.\n\nPredation\nThe Siberian roe deer is preyed upon by the Amur leopard, Siberian lynx, snow leopard, Himalayan wolf, and Siberian tiger.\n\nSee also\nAnimals portal\n Siberia portal\nPassage 2:\nBambi, a Life in the Woods\nBambi, a Life in the Woods (German title: Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde) is a 1923 Austrian coming-of-age novel written by Felix Salten, and originally published in Berlin by Ullstein Verlag. The novel traces the life of Bambi, a male roe deer, from his birth through childhood, the loss of his mother, the finding of a mate, the lessons he learns from his father, and the experience he gains about the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest. It is also, in its most complete translation, seen as a parable of the dangers and persecution faced by Jews in Europe.An English translation by Whittaker Chambers was published in North America by Simon & Schuster in 1928, and the novel has since been translated and published in over thirty languages around the world. Salten published a sequel, Bambi's Children, in 1939.\nThe novel was well received by critics and is considered a classic, as well as one of the first environmental novels. It was adapted into a theatrical animated film, Bambi, by Walt Disney Productions in 1942, as well as two Russian live-action adaptations in 1985 and 1986, a ballet in 1987, and a stage production in 1998. Another ballet adaptation was created by an Oregon troupe, but never premiered. Janet Schulman published a children's picture book adaptation in 2000 that featured realistic oil paintings and many of Salten's original words.\n\nPlot\nBambi is a roe deer fawn born in a thicket in late spring one year. Over the course of the summer, his mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways de,6 × 57 by the C.I.P.) cartridge was created by Rheinisch-Westfälische Sprengstoffwerke (RWS) in Germany in 1964 by necking down popular 7×57mm Mauser (similarly to how Paul Mauser himself created 6.5×57mm Mauser) for hunting small deer such as roe deer, and for chamois. The calibre has a significant following among European sportsmen, and most European mass production riflemakers chamber several models of rifle for this cartridge.  During the 1970-1990 period this cartridge was widely and successfully used in the Republic of Ireland for deer shooting, since security considerations at a period of Provisional Irish Republican Army violence had led to a ban on the civilian ownership of calibres larger than .224in.  Some British small deer specialist hunters use the 5.6×57 mm with great success on roe deer, muntjac and Chinese water deer.With a factory-load velocity of 3,500 ft/s (1,100 m/s) with a 74-grain, cone-pointed bullet, it is approximately 100 ft/s (30 m/s) faster than the .220 Swift cartridge firing a bullet of equivalent weight.  The larger case capacity means that handloaders can produce 50-grain loads that, with velocities in excess of 4,100 ft/s (1,200 m/s), will outpace anything that can safely be achieved by the Swift. The .223 Winchester Super Short Magnum is a 21st-century cartridge that is comparable to the 5.6×57 mm.The 5.6×57mm cartridge case has a distinctively thick case wall, and this causes significant problems when handloading, owing to the force that needs to be used through the press when re-sizing the case neck.  It has been suggested that this unusual neck thickness is the result of the use of .22 rimfire chamber adapters in centrefire rifles chambered for this cartridge.\n\n5.6×57mm rimmed variant\nThe 5.6×57mmR (designated as the 5,6 × 57 R by the C.I.P.) is a rimmed variant of the 5.6×57mm. The rimmed variant was designed for break-open rifles and is almost identical to the rimless variant except for the rim.\n\nSpecifications\nBullet diameter: 5.69 mm (.224\")\nLoads:\n74 gr @ 1040 m/s (3412 ft/s)\n60 gr @ 3700 ft/s\nPassage 8:\nWhitetail Deer Cutaneous Fibroma\nCutaneous fibromas (also known as deer warts) are common neoplasms occurring in wild and domestic deer of many species and are caused by host-specific viral infections. The fibromas occur most frequently in animals under 2 years of age, with cases in older deer reported occasionally or rarely.Deer fibromas appear on the skin as hard and round tumors that can be up to 1 cm in diameter. The tumors are blackish or brown and have a rough-textured surface. They do not cause the animal harm unless clumps of fibromas interfere with breathing, eating, or walking.\nFibromas have been reported in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), fallow deer (Cervus dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), moose (Alces alces), and caribou (Rangifer caribou).\" They occur across the entirety of the white-tail deer's range.\n\nClinical signs and symptoms\nThe only visible signs of cutaneous fibroma in white-tailed deer are fleshy wart-like growths on the skin. These growths can vary from single to clusters of warts. These warts can also vary in size from small to very large. They are only attached to the skin, not to the underlying muscle and bone, so their only physical effects on the deer stem from their ability to impair the deer's sight and range of motion if they are large enough to inhibit normal behavior. Deer with these growths can still be in perfect health and usually show no symptoms of ill health.\n\nTransmission\nThe fibromas are most often caused by host-specific papillomaviruses. They may also be due to host-specific poxviruses.The transmission of cutaneous fibromas in the white-tailed deer is caused by a virus that is thought to be transmitted through a variety of insect bites or by a deer coming in contact with any contaminated object that scratches or penetrates the skin of the deer or contaminates wounded/damaged skin. Deer tend to frequent particular trails during their movements, and may thus potentially become infected by contact with objects on the path previously contaminated by other deer. As fibromas occur more commonly in bucks, the virus is probably often transmitted during sparring.This disease appears temporary, manifesting after about 7 weeks after inoculation and lasting only about two months. Cutaneous fibromas are not transmissible to other livestock or to humans if their meat is consumed.\n\nOccurrence\nFibromas occur most frequently in animals under 2 years of age. The tumor has been diagnosed in 2.1% of males and 0.4% of females. More bucks are shot (either by law or hunter preference), which influences the sampling.\n\nTreatment and control\nTreatment is not a feasible option for most wild populations. The disease has not been a problem in captive herds. The growths could be removed surgically if they became important, but that would rarely be an issue. Because exposure to the virus leads to immunity, it should be possible to develop a vaccine if prevention becomes necessary. To date, this disease has been too rare to justify such actions.\n\nPrognosis\nLarge, ulcerated fibromas are infrequent. In most deer, the fibromas develop to only a few millimeters in diameter. Tumors then regress; this has been observed both in naturally occurring and experimentally induced cases. Only in an occasional deer do they develop into conspicuous skin tumors. Results of a New York survey indicated that wild deer are exposed and develop an immunity to the fibroma virus early in life.\n\nSignificance\nFibromatosis is not an important cause of deer mortality. The disease is not known to infect humans. Although they do not harm the meat, fibromas are repulsive to most people, so they discourage them from consuming the deer.Some domesticated animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) are subject to \"warts\" common to their species. Fibromatosis of deer is quite unlikely to be infectious to domestic animals.\n\nSee also\nShope papilloma virus\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFishing rod tapers\nFishing rod tapers describe how much a fishing rod bends or flexes under pressure.  Different tapers are used for different fishing scenarios as well as for personal preference.\n\nAction\nThe action of a taper is described by the flex of the tip of a rod when pressure is applied perpendicular to the rod.  Only a section of the rod starting at the tip of the rod should bend while the remainder of the rod should stay rigid.\nVariations can be described in three main categories, fast, medium, or slow with variations in between each.  A rod with a fast taper will only flex the top 20 percent. Medium fast and medium tapers will flex approximately 30 to 60 percent of the rod respectively. If the rod has a slow taper, almost the entire rod or blank will bend or flex under pressure.\n\nUsage\nRod taper is important for several reasons. The feel for the lure being used and the fish being caught dictate the appropriate taper use.\nA fast action tip will be used when fishing jig type lures.  The angler can feel and therefore control what the lure is doing quite easily.  Since only the very tip of the rod bends, when a fish strikes the angler has ample rod shaft and backbone to set the hook correctly.\nIn contrast to fast tapers, the slow flex rods offer the angler advantages when fighting large fish with light fishing line.  This additional flex allows the rod to absorb the force of the fish as opposed to the line.  This is often the angler who likes to fish split shot rigs or Lindy rigs for walleye.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 2:\nPersonal Preference\nPersonal Preference is a 1987 board game created by Donal Carlston that involves guessing the order in which a player prefers foods, activities, people, and other items compared to one another. The game was published by Broderbund in the United States, Playtoy Industries in Canada, and Parker Brothers International in Britain.\nAn updated version by the original creator was launched on Kickstarter on May 1, 2023. The new version contains updated cultural references and new categories.\n\nOriginal 1987 Version\nThe game contains cards in four categories: Food & Drink, Activities, People, and Potpourri (miscellaneous). Each card has a photo or drawing on each side and text indicating what that side represents (e.g., chocolate éclairs, climbing a mountain, Harrison Ford, spy novels). Each round, one player draws four cards from one category, or one from each category, depending on the player's position on the board. Each card is placed in a colored quadrant of the board. The player then ranks these four items according to his or her preference using color-coded cards that are placed in an envelope. Next, other players (or teams) use numbered tiles to guess that player's order, and move forward one space for each correct guess when the order is revealed. If players choose to double a guess by placing a tile towards the center of the board, they move forward two spaces if correct and back one space if incorrect. Players take turns drawing and ranking cards until someone reaches the end of the board.\n\nReviews\nGames #89\nBest Games of 1988 in Games #94\nPassage 3:\nPie floater\nThe pie floater is an Australian dish particularly common in Adelaide. It consists of a meat pie in a thick pea soup, typically with the addition of tomato sauce. Believed to have been first created in the 1890s, the pie floater gained popularity as a meal sold by South Australian pie carts. In 2003, it was recognised as a South Australian Heritage Icon.\n\nDevelopment\nPea soup with meat has long been part of English culinary history, with mentions in the 19th century, including the \"pea and pie supper\" (in Yorkshire), \"pea soup with eel\", and suet dumplings or saveloys.  (Dumplings in soup were known as \"floaters\".)  It may have developed from those dishes, which are useful for feeding groups of people on a budget, such as at a sports match or at harvest time. \nA pie floater commonly consists of a traditional Australian-style meat pie, usually sitting, but sometimes submerged (traditionally upside down) in a bowl of thick pea soup made from blue boiler peas. It is often self-garnished with tomato sauce, and the consumer may also add a combination of mint sauce, salt, pepper, or malt vinegar according to personal preference.\nEarly records in South Australia state that the pie floater was reputedly born in Port Pirie conceived by one Ern \"Shorty\" Bradley in 1890s, but it remains unknown if he did and how it came about.\n\nPie carts\nPie floaters were typically purchased in the street from pie-carts as a late evening meal. Pie-carts are typically a form of caravan/trailer/cart, originally horse-drawn, with an elongated \"window\" along one or both sides where customers could sit or (more usually) stand to eat their purchases. The pie-cart was typically moved into position at lunchtime and in the evening. As traffic became busier and on-street car-parking in demand, the carts evolved to have one window on the \"footpath side\", and were moved into position after afternoon peak-hour traffic had ebbed. They did business until late evening or early morning, after which they were returned to their daytime storage locations.South Australia has had pie carts in the Adelaide metropolitan area since the 1870s. In the evenings, the Norwood pie-cart was located on The Parade adjacent to the Norwood Town Hall. It was also the only place where members of the public could buy draft Hall's \"Stonie\" ginger beer directly from the keg. In the Adelaide city centre in the 1880s, there were 13 pie-carts operating in King William Street and North Terrace. By 1915 there were nine pie-carts in operation. By 1958 this had reduced to two: Balfour's pie-cart on North Terrace outside the Adelaide railway station, and Cowley's in Victoria Square outside the Adelaide General Post Office. In 2007, the Glenelg tram line was extended from Victoria Square along King William Street and North Terrace past Adelaide railway station, and the Balfour's pie-cart was forced to close.In 2003, the South Australian National Trust traced the history of the pie floater back over 130 years. The pie floater was recognised as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia, although it is now available at very few locations; among them are the Café de Vilis, Enjoy Bakery on Norwood Parade, The Kings Head Pub on King William Street  and the Upper Sturt General Store.\n\nSee also\nList of legume dishes\nPassage 4:\nPersonal Taste\nPersonal Taste (Korean: 개인의 취향; Hanja: 個人의 趣向; RR: Kaeinui Chwihyang; MR: Kaein-ŭi Ch‘wihyang; lit. \"stereotypes. The girls follow Stefani around on tour and are contractually obligated not to speak English in public. The performer had \"renamed\" them corresponding to her album title and clothing brand, L.A.M.B.: Love, Angel, Music, and Baby.Furthermore, there have been many cases of Asian fetishism leading to criminal activity. In one case in 2000, two men, David Dailey and Edmund Ball, and a woman, Lana Vickery, abducted and blindfolded two Japanese women in Washington, one who was eighteen and the other who was nineteen. Vickery said Ball specifically targeted these Japanese students because he thought that they were submissive and were less likely to report sexual abuse. In another case, in 2005, Michael Lohman, a doctoral student at Princeton University, was charged by the state of New Jersey for reckless endangerment, theft, harassment as well as tampering with a food product. Michael had cut locks of hair off at least nine Asian women. He also poured his semen and urine into the drinks of Asian Princeton students more than fifty times. In his apartment, Michael also had mittens filled with hairs of Asian women.\n\nArab and Middle Eastern women\nAccording to multiple articles, the West's fetishization of fully covered Arab women has led to the stereotype that Arab women and women from the Muslim world are oppressed and therefore submissive. When French armies invaded Algeria, they had anticipated Algerian women to be sexually available and hookah smokers. To their surprise, Algerian women actually appeared to have been more modestly dressed and covered from their head to toes. Many French photographers paid Algerian women to remove part of their religious attire and pose for photos to make French postcards. In his book Desiring Arabs, Joseph Massad talks about how the West's interpretation of Arab culture has painted the stereotype of Arab women being exotic and desirable. Massad's book was largely influenced by Edward Said's book Orientalism.\n\nMixed race women/Latin woman\nIn her book Sex Tourism in Bahia Ambiguous Entanglements, Erica Lorraine Williams published the first full-length ethnography of sex tourism in Brazil, including interviews with tourists who come solely to participate in sexual tourism, which may be considered a form of racialized fetishism. One of the tourists interviewed described his experience, \"I've had a thing for Latin, brown-skinned women since my early twenties. I'm from [a place] where there are a lot of blonde, white girls. Whatever you have, you like the opposite – they're exotic, intriguing.\"\n\nBlack women\nThe fetishization of black women expanded during the Colonial Era, as some white male slave owners raped and sexually abused their black, female slaves. They justified their actions by labeling the women as hyper-sexual property. These labels solidified into what is commonly referred to as the \"Jezebel\" stereotype. The opposite of this \"Jezebel\" identity or persona is the \"Mammy\" figure who loses all of her sexual agency and autonomy, and becomes an asexual figure.  L. H. Stallings notes that the creation and identities for the Jezebel or Mammy figures are \"dependent upon patriarchy and heterosexuality.\" An example of racial fetishism within the colonial era is that of Sarah Baartman. Baartman's body was utilized as a means to develop an anatomically accurate representation of a black woman's body juxtaposed to that of a  white European woman's body during the age of biological racism. The scientist studying her anatomy went as far as making a mold of Baartman's genitalia postmortem because she refused him access to examine her vaginal region while she was alive. The data collected on Baartman is the origin of the black female body stereotype, i.e. large buttocks and labia.Charmaine Nelson suggests that every nude painting feeds into the voyeuristic male gaze, but the way black women are painted has even more undertones. \"The black female body defies the white male subject's desire for a single subject of 'pure' origin in two ways: firstly, through a sexual 'otherness' as woman, and secondly through a racial and color 'otherness' as black. It is the combined power of these two markers of social location which has enabled western artists to represent black women at the margins of societal boundaries of propriety.\" Nelson asserts that any black woman is considered a fetish in these paintings and that she is only viewed in a sexual lens.One of the more recent popular discourses around the fetishization of black women surrounds the release of Nicki Minaj's popular song, \"Anaconda\" in 2014. The entire song and music video revolves around the largeness of black women's bottoms. While some praise Minaj's work for its embrace of female sexuality, some criticized that this song continues to reduce black women to be the focus of the male gaze. The 2020 song \"WAP\" (\"Wet-Ass Pussy\") by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion received a similar mixed reception, with some outlets praising its embrace of black female sexuality and others claiming it was degrading or objectifying women of color.\n\nBlack men\n\"Big black cock\", usually shortened to \"BBC\", is a sexual slang and genre of ethnic pornography, that focuses on Black men with large penises. The stereotype of larger penis size in black men has been subjected to scientific scrutiny, with inconclusive results. The theme is found in both straight and gay pornography.\n\nIn BDSM\nThere is also a practice in BDSM which involves fetishizing race called \"raceplay\". Susanne Schotanus defined raceplay as \"a sexual practice where the either imagined or real racial background of one or more of the participants is used to create this power-imbalance in a BDSM-scene, through the use of slurs, narratives and objects laden with racial history.\" Feminist author Audre Lorde cautions that this kind of BDSM \"operates in tandem with social, cultural, economic, and political patterns of domination and submission\" creating the perpetuation of negative stereotypes for black women in particular.However, race play can also be used within BDSM as a curative practice for black individuals to take back their autonomy from a history of subjugation. One BDSM Dominatrix explains that raceplay provides her with an \"emotional sense of reparations\". \"Violence for black female performers in BDSM becomes not just a vehicle of intense pleasure but also a mode of accessing and critiquing power.\"\n\nSee also\nAfrophobia\nAnti-miscegenation laws\nDiscrimination based on skin color\nDiscrimination in the United States\nEthnic pornography\nGendered racism\nInterracial marriage\nRace and crime\nRacism against African Americans\nRacism in the United States\nSexual capital#Race\nSexual objectification\nStereotypes of African Americans\nStereotypes of groups within the United States\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It was held between 23 August to 17 September 1956 with games being played at the Lake Oval, home ground of South Melbourne as it was the only ground equipped to host night games.\nEight teams played in the first competition with the final seeing an attendance of 32,450 as South Melbourne defeated Carlton in the final by 6 points (13.16.94 to 13.10.88).\n\nGames\nQuarterfinals\nThe opening match of the 1956 edition saw South Melbourne record the first victory of the new competition by 20 points over St Kilda. But the match was remembered for the brawl that happened in the third quarter which featured all of the players, umpires and some spectators in scenes not since the 1945 VFL Grand Final between Carlton and South Melbourne. The following match which was played five days later saw a surprise victory by North Melbourne who defeated Essendon by two points with North Melbourne leading at every change to get the win. Richmond and Carlton also recorded narrow wins over Hawthorn and Fitzroy in the remaining two quarter-finals which was played on 30 August and the 4 September.\n\nSemifinals\nThe semi-finals began on the 6 September with South Melbourne taking on North Melbourne.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nElle King\nTanner Elle Schneider (born July 3, 1989), known professionally as Elle King, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actress. Her musical style is influenced by country, rock and blues.In 2012, King released her debut EP, The Elle King EP, on RCA; one track from that EP, \"Playing for Keeps\", is the theme song for VH1's Mob Wives Chicago series.She released her debut album, Love Stuff, in 2015. It produced the US top ten single \"Ex's & Oh's\", which earned her two Grammy Award nominations. King has also toured with acts such as Of Monsters and Men, Train, James Bay, The Chicks, Heart, Joan Jett, Michael Kiwanuka, and Miranda Lambert. Her parents are actor and comedian Rob Schneider and former model London King.  She uses her mother's surname to distinguish herself and her career and identity from her father's, telling ABC News that \"I think that my voice and my music speaks for itself: that I am my own person.\"King is a four-time Grammy Award nominee, two each in the rock and country categories, and received honors from the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nEarly life\nKing was born on July 3, 1989, in Los Angeles, California, to then-Saturday Night Live cast member Rob Schneider and London King, a former model. Her parents divorced and her mother remarried. She grew up living in Ohio, between Wellston and Columbus. When she was nine, her stepfather, Justin Tesa, gave her a record by all-female hard-rock band the Donnas; she views this as the pivotal moment when she decided she wanted to be a musician. Around this time, she also started listening to the Runaways and Blondie, and she made her acting debut alongside her father in the movie Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.At the age of 13, King started playing guitar, immersing herself in the music of Otis Redding, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, AC/DC (she has the phrase \"dirty deeds\" tattooed on her biceps), and Earl Scruggs. Her interest in the country and bluegrass of Hank Williams and Earl Scruggs inspired her to learn the banjo. During her teenage years, she attended Buck's Rock camp in Connecticut, where she starred successfully in a number of musicals.King spent her teenage years in New York City, but she has also lived in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Upon graduating from Elisabeth Irwin High School/Little Red School House, she moved to Philadelphia to enroll at the University of the Arts, studying painting and film. During these college years, she had an artistic epiphany seeing a live show where the band onstage used a banjo purely for accompaniment purposes, eschewing the bluegrass and country musical vocabulary traditionally associated with the instrument. King then began to use the banjo as a compositional tool. After college, she briefly lived in Copenhagen and Los Angeles, before moving back to New York where she currently resides in Bushwick, Brooklyn.\n\nCareer\n1999–2013: Career beginnings\nIn 1999, she debuted as an actress in her father's film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. In 2005, at age 16, she started gigging around New York City, using a fake ID to gain entry to the local nightclubs. King immersed herself in the local songwriting scene and honed her performance skills by busking around town. King was then signed by newly appointed RCA Chairman Peter Edge. Her debut single \"Good To Be A Man\", was released on March 13, 2012, as a digital download and also as a 7\" vinyl single. On June 12, 2012, the four-song The Elle King EP was released on RCA. The EP was recorded in New York and was produced by Andy Baldwin and Chris DeStefano, with King herself producing a track. The EP's lead track, \"Playing for Keeps\", was chosen as the theme song for VH1's Mob Wives Chicago series that premiered on June 10, 2012, on VH1.King was spotlighted as an \"Artist to Watch in 2012\" by Esquire Magazine and made television appearances on VH1 Big Morning Buzz Live and the Late Show with David Letterman. King has played Austin, Texas, at the South by Southwest Festival, as well as the Hammersmith Apollo. She has also taped her own PBS Arts In Context special for KLRU Austin at the Austin City Limits recording studio. She toured with Of Monsters and Men, Train and Michael Kiwanuka and has opened for Dashboard Confessional, Dropkick Murphys, Dry the River, James Bay and Ed Sheeran.\n\n2014–present: Love Stuff, Shake the Spirit and Come And Get Your Wife\nIn September 2014, King released \"Ex's & Oh's\", which serves as the lead single off her debut album. She released the album, Love Stuff on February 17, 2015. She performed \"Ex's & Oh's\" the next day on The Today Show to promote it. The song reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming King's first top ten single in the United States. \"Ex's & Oh's\" received two nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards: Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song. In July 2015, King supported Modest Mouse on their UK tour. \"Under the Influence\" and \"America's Sweetheart\" were later released as singles for rock radio and mainstream radio, respectively. In 2016, her single \"Good Girls\" featured on the Ghostbusters soundtrack and played over the movie's credits. In 2016, she teamed up with country singer Dierks Bentley for the song \"Different for Girls\". They performed this song at the 50th CMA Awards on November 2, 2016, when she and Bentley won the award for Musical Event of the Year.On March 6, 2017, she premiered a new single \"Wild Love\" featuring a sparse electronic production, marking a slight departure from her previous style in music. King released her second studio album, Shake the Spirit, on October 19, 2018, which she made with her band the Brethren. On August 3, 2019, she was featured singing on a version of  Lindsey Stirling's \"The Upside\". Throughout 2019, King served as a guest co-host on the MTV series Catfish: The TV Show opposite lead host Nev Schulman.King's third album, Come Get Your Wife, was released on January 27, 2023, and displays a move into country music.\n\nMusical style and influences\nAccording to The Guardian, King's musical style is \"steeped in every genre of vintage Americana  – sassygirl. When each woman wears one of the earrings, their bodies are magically swapped while their minds remain in place.\nIn her modern-day suburban home, Jessica Spencer is a beautiful but mean-spirited \"hot chick\". Her closest friends are April, Keecia, and Lulu. April is Jessica's best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. At school one day, Jessica makes fun of an overweight girl named Hildenburg and a Wiccan girl named Eden. After that, she and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica gets her rival Bianca into trouble and finds the earrings in an African-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them.\nShortly afterward, small-time criminal Clive Maxtone robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop there and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. She accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, the girls drive away, and Clive picks up the earring. That evening, in their respective homes, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other's body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheering competition and the school prom coming up soon.\nAfter Jessica convinces her friends of who she is, they help her investigate the body swap. Hildenburg, Eden, and Bianca are all innocent, Hildenburg and Eden join Jessica after she apologizes to them, and Eden finds a picture of the earrings on the internet. When the girls return to the African store, the owner explains how the earrings work and tells the girls they must find the other earring soon or the change will become permanent.\nMeanwhile, Jessica is hired for two jobs while secretly living with April. At her own home, where she works as a gardener, her parents tell her about their marital problems and she helps them rekindle their sex life. \nAt school, while cleaning the boys' locker room as a custodian, she spies on her boyfriend Billy, who truly loves her, and April's boyfriend Jake, who has been cheating on her. Faced with Jake's infidelity, April begins to fall in love with Jessica, who agrees to take her to the prom. \nAt the cheering competition, Jessica signals romantically to Billy while disguised as the school mascot, but when the head of her suit falls off, he becomes confused and leaves with Bianca. \nJessica goes to the prom with April and they kiss. Jake sees this and is so upset, he spills his drink on his date. April confesses to being in love with Jessica, who tells April she is perfect and doesn't need anybody. Jessica tries to win Billy back, telling Billy it's her in Clive's body, but he is so shocked and confused that he runs off. \nDuring this time, Clive has been using Jessica's body to make money from men, including Billy, who gives him his money and car, believing he is Jessica. Clive then tries to run him over. On the evening of the prom, Hildenburg sees a video of Clive in Jessica's body robbing a man on the TV news, goes to the scene of the crime, and finds a business card for the club where Clive works as a pole dancer. She informs Jessica at the prom, and the girls go to the club. \nWhen they find Clive, Jessica steals his earring and puts it on herself along with the other one. With both earrings now on the same person, Jessica's and Clive's bodies return to their original owners.\nAfter Jessica makes up with Billy, the film ends with the school's graduation ceremony, followed by a scene in which Clive, running from the law and still dressed in lingerie and handcuffs, is picked up by a bartender who believes he is a homosexual. The bartender turns around slowly with a sinister smile on his face to look at Clive, and locks the doors. Clive screams in horror.\n\nCast\nWes Takahashi, former animator and visual effects supervisor for Industrial Light & Magic, makes a cameo appearance as a news reporter. Schneider's mother Pilar appears as a judge of the cheerleading contest.\n\nProduction\nFilming took place at University High School in West Los Angeles. Speaking on the film, Schneider commented: \"No man is a hundred-percent masculine and no woman is a hundred-percent feminine – we're all just somewhere on the scale there. So what I tried to do was just play it with an innocence and gentleness, and then find some physical keys to lock-in on.\"\n\nCasting\nSingers Ashlee Simpson and Michelle Branch each make their feature film debut with cameo roles.\n\nSoundtrack\nRelease\nThe Hot Chick was originally rated R, but several scenes were edited out in order to receive the broader PG-13 rating. The R version was classified 12A in Britain, maintaining the same rating given to the PG-13 theatrical version.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film opened at #5 at the U.S. box office on the weekend of December 13–15, 2002, taking in US$7,401,146, averaging $3,338 across the 2,217 theatres where it was shown. It went on to earn a total worldwide gross of $54,639,553.\n\nCritical response\nThe Hot Chick received negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 21% based on reviews from 82 critics, with an average score of 3.90/10. The critical consensus read: \"The Hot Chick's one-note concept gets stretched thin, and a lot of the jokes fall flat.\" On Metacritic, as of October 2020, the film had a score of 29 out 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave the film two thumbs way down. Ebert gave the film half a star (out of a possible four), declaring, \"The MPAA rates this PG-13. It is too vulgar for anyone under 13, and too dumb for anyone over 13.\" Roeper panned the film saying \"it's in color. And, it was mostly in focus.\"Dennis Harvey of Variety magazine wrote: \"At best routinely assembled—at worst barely competent. The slapstick is labored, and the bigger setpieces flat.\"\n\nAccolades\nRob Schneider was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor of the Decade for his performance in the film.\n\nHome media\nThe Hot Chick was released May 13, 2003 on VHS and DVD. The DVD featured the deleted scenes that would have made the film an R, including an alternate ending.\n\nSee also\nFreaky Friday  (1976)\nBig (1988)\nBody swaps in films\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The population was 7,218 at the 2010 census.\nThe city is also home to the main campus of the largest church in the state (and one of the country's largest Protestant churches), the Southeast Christian Church.\n\nHistory\nThe City of Middletown was originally incorporated in 1797 by the Jefferson County Court on 500 acres of land lying on a branch of the forks of Beargrass Creek that originally belonged to Jacob Meyers and Culberth Harrison. Though there is no recorded explanation why the city was named Middletown, it is commonly believed that that name was chosen because the town was in the \"middle\" of the two older cities of Louisville which was founded June 24, 1778, and Shelbyville, which was founded December 20, 1792. In 1871 the Kentucky General Assembly amended the original charter to increase Middletown's boundaries.\nAfter failing to hold elections and collect taxes after 1919, Circuit Judge McCauley Smith dissolved the city's charter on July 26, 1960, and Middletown lost its 163-year-old city status.

However, Knox County has refused to give Corbin any tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits. On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the \"Stivers amendment\", passed as part of KY HB 499 \"Tax Amnesty\" legislation in 2012, did not violate the state's constitution. The measure essentially canceled the effect of court rulings that would have enabled Corbin to keep all the revenue from the tax generated inside the city limits. Corbin's mayor, Willard McBurney, vowed to carry the fight to the state Supreme Court.Corbin is in Kentucky's 5th congressional district.\n\nEducation\nCorbin, like many communities of its size in southeastern Kentucky, has an independent school system (in Kentucky, a public school system not affiliated with a county; most such districts are associated with individual cities). The district was officially established in 1916, and the 100th class graduated in 2017. The Corbin Independent School District includes:\n\nCorbin Preschool Center\nCorbin Primary (grades K-3)\nCorbin Elementary (grades 4–5) (Currently housed by the newest building in the district after a complete remodeling of the former Middle School.\nCorbin Middle (grades 6–8)\nCorbin High (grades 9–12) (Currently housed by the oldest building in the district)\nCorbin School Of InnovationThe community and school system place considerable emphasis on the success of academics and high school athletic teams. Corbin \"Redhound\" sports are important social events within the community.\nIn 2004, Eastern Kentucky University opened an extension campus in Corbin.\nThe annual Battle for the Brass Lantern, a college football rivalry game between the University of the Cumberlands and Union College, was played at Corbin High School's stadium in 2006 and 2007, as a neutral field roughly equidistant from the two campuses. The rivalry dates to 1905.Corbin was formerly home to Saint Camillus Academy, a private pre-K-8 Catholic school affiliated with the Diocese of Lexington. Established in 1908 by the Sisters of Divine Providence, the school has been successful as both a boarding school for national and international students and as a Montessori school. Its original schoolhouse, built in 1913, was demolished in summer 2008. The new school building is still situated atop a prominent hill overlooking the town, providing a striking backdrop to the streets of downtown Corbin. The school closed in 2012 after 99 years of service. The property and grounds of the school were sold to the Corbin School System to house a new Corbin Middle School due to the rapidly increasing student population and age of the current building.\nCorbin has a lending library, the Corbin Public Library.\n\nTransportation\nCorbin straddles Interstate 75 and U.S. Highway 25 (which splits into US 25E and US 25W in North Corbin).

Already in rough animation, the song was recorded by Shani Wallis. However, Katzenberg and the new management desired a more contemporary song as they would help make the film more marketable. Michael Jackson was considered by Eisner to voice a character who would enter the saloon, confront Basil, and sing a song at the tavern, but the suggestion was met with uncomfortable silence for which Eisner withdrew the idea; Eisner later proposed for Madonna to perform the song. Eventually, Melissa Manchester was brought in; she wrote and performed \"Let Me Be Good to You\", by which the rough animation had to be re-timed and often re-animated to properly sync with the song. Mancini also co-wrote two of the film's three original songs, \"The World's Greatest Criminal Mind\" and \"Goodbye So Soon\" (both performed by Vincent Price).\n\nSongs\nOriginal songs performed in the film include:\n\nRelease\nDuring the film's initial theatrical release, the film was accompanied with the short, Clock Cleaners.\n\nHome media\nFollowing the theatrical re-release in February 1992, the film was released on VHS and Laserdisc in July 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series. It was placed into moratorium on April 30, 1993. It was released again on VHS on August 3, 1999 (with a game sheet inside it as part of a contest) and on DVD in 2002 with a short making-of featurette. In the United Kingdom, it was first released on VHS in 1992 followed by re-releases in 1993 and 1995.\nA \"Mystery in the Mist Edition\" of The Great Mouse Detective was released on DVD on April 13, 2010, and on Blu-ray Disc on October 9, 2012. Unlike previous home media releases, which all used the 1992 reissue title print (The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective), this DVD restored the original 1986 title card, which had previously not been seen since the original 1986 release. The DVD also has the film in its 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio, which brings it closer to its original theatrical aspect ratio. The Blu-ray edition is region-free and thus can be played in any region of the world. The Blu-ray was finally released in the UK on November 9, 2015, and released in France on Blu-ray on October 20, 2015.\n\nReception\nCritical reaction\nOn their syndicated television show, At the Movies, the film received a \"two thumbs up\" rating from critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. In his print review for The Chicago Tribune, Siskel enthusiastically praised the film as the most \"truly memorable animated feature in 25 years\" that \"travels a wide emotional range, taking us from cuddly to scary, from recognition to wonder.\" Likewise, in his print review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film three stars out of four in which he praised the film's animation and compared the film to that of Disney's golden age. He summarized that \"the result is a movie like The Great Mouse Detective, which looks more fully animated than anything in some 30 years.\"London's Time Out magazine wrote, \"As usual with film noir [...] it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben.\" Nina Darnton of The New York Times applauded that \"[t]he heroes are appealing, the villains have that special Disney flair – humorous blackguards who really enjoy being evil – and the script is witty and not overly sentimental.\" Johanna Steinmetz, also from The Chicago Tribune, graded the film three-and-a-half stars (out of four) writing \"This movie is cute, cute, cute, but it's a higher grade of cute than The Rescuers (1977) and The Fox and the Hound (1981). The key to good Disney animation is character and facial expression, and Detective abounds in both.\" Alex Stewart reviewed The Great Mouse Detective for White Dwarf #83, and stated that \"After their dismal fudge of The Black Cauldron, it's good to see the Disney studios taking a step, however cautious, towards the world of animation as it is today. The style is looser and more vigorous, and, in a climactic fight inside Big Ben, effectively amalgamates computer-drawn clockwork with hand-drawn characters.\"The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7.1/10 based on 25 reviews. The website's consensus states that \"The Great Mouse Detective may not rank with Disney's classics, but it's an amiable, entertaining picture with some stylishly dark visuals.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 73 based on 13 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".Animation critic Charles Solomon listed this as one of the best animated films of the 1980s while singling out Keane's key work on Ratigan.\n\nBox-office\nThe film grossed around $50 million worldwide against a budget of over $14 million during its initial release. Its inexpensive success after its predecessor's under-performance gave the new management of Disney confidence in the viability of their animation department, though it was surpassed at the box office by An American Tail. Re-titled as The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective, the film was re-released theatrically on February 14, 1992, where it grossed $13,288,756. The Great Mouse Detective has had a lifetime North American gross of $38.7 million across its original release and reissue.\n\nLegacy\nBasil and Professor Ratigan were characters to meet-and-greet at the Disney Parks, until both were retired after 2004.\nIn the television series Darkwing Duck, a little statue of Basil opened the secret passage to Darkwing's hidden base. Some of the characters from the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series House of Mouse.\nProfessor Ratigan is one of the villains with a main focus in the anthology film Once Upon a Halloween. He is also one of the villains present in the board game Disney Villainous.Basil of Baker Street appears as a playable character in the video game Disney Heroes: Battle Mode.Additionally, in honor of Mickey Mouse's 75th anniversary, was planned a film under the title The Search for Mickey Mouse in which Mickey gets kidnapped by unknown forces, forcing Minnie Mouse to enlist Basil of Baker Street to investigate his disappearance.

Plakun is an American psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, researcher and forensic psychiatrist. He is the current medical director/CEO at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Plakun's primary interests include the mental health advocacy, full implementation of the mental health parity law, access-to-care issues, and reducing health disparities; the value of and evidence base for psychosocial treatments and the diagnosis, treatment, longitudinal course and outcome of patients with borderline personality disorder and treatment resistant disorders. Plakun has been widely published and quoted in the media on psychotherapy and psychiatry, including in The New York Times and The Globe and Mail. He has appeared in the media to discuss his psychiatric work on WAMC, the Albany, New York, affiliate of NPR. and on CBS 60 Minutes. His psychiatric research has been widely cited.\n\nCareer\nPlakun attended Hofstra University and received an M.D. from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1972. After an internship in medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Plakun worked as a rural primary care practitioner in Vermont before completing a psychiatric residency also at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and a Fellowship and Advanced Fellowship in Psychoanalytic Studies at the Austen Riggs Center.\nHe is a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, and serves on the APA Board of Trustees representing New England and Eastern Canada. He is a former member of the APA Assembly, where he served as chair of the Assembly Committee of Representatives of Subspecialties and Sections and on the Assembly Executive Committee. In the APA he has also been past chair of the Committee on Psychotherapy by Psychiatrists, and the founding leader of the APA Psychotherapy Caucus. Plakun is a Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists and a Fellow of the American College of Psychoanalysts. He is a Psychoanalytic Fellow and former Trustee of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry. He is an associate editor of the journal Psychodynamic Psychiatry. Plakun also served for more than a decade with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology as a member of the written test committee and as an oral examiner.

An advocate for the value of psychotherapy and psychosocial treatment, Plakun has argued for the full implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act, served as Plaintiffs’ expert on adult mental disorders in Wit v. United Behavioral Health federal class-action, and has presented and written about the case. He has also researched and written on what he calls \"Psychiatry’s False Assumptions\":  [1] genes = disease; [2] patients present with single disorders that respond to specific evidence-based treatments; and [3] the best treatments are pills. Separately, he has written about psychodynamic residential treatment for patients who have encountered an impasse in their treatment and has called for an evidence-based, inclusive reconceptualization of how psychotherapy competencies are presented and taught to residents.\n\nSelected publications\nPlakun, Eric M.; Burkhardt, Paul E.; Muller, John P.

It is part of the Georgia Public Broadcasting radio network, a state network which in turn is a member of National Public Radio, Public Radio Exchange, and American Public Media.  Unlike most stations on the GPB network, WGPB does not completely simulcast with the network.  WGPB also produces its own programs.  The studios are located at Georgia Highlands College's Heritage Hall campus in downtown Rome, from which locally produced programming originates. The station began broadcasting as WGPB at 5 AM on June 30, 2006.\n\nHistory\nThe station began broadcasting May 22, 1965 as WROM-FM, sister station to WROM AM 710. It had that callsign until November 1979 when it became WKCX, known as \"K98\", most recently with a hot adult contemporary format.  A satellite-delivered format was used during most of the broadcast day, except for mornings and afternoons.  The station was previously owned by Mills Fitzner, who owned WKCX for 20 years under the name Briar Creek Broadcasting Corp.\n\nFormat and callsign change\nIn 2006, WKCX was sold to Georgia Public Broadcasting, with the format changed from hot adult contemporary, to public broadcasting. The deal was announced in March 2006, and was finalized after a 45-day waiting period on June 29, one day before GPB began broadcasting on the frequency.  Most of WKCX's staff left the station on May 31 in preparation for the changeover. The station began broadcasting as WGPB at 5 AM on June 30, 2006.\n\nCoverage\nWGPB is the first GPB or NPR radio station in northwest Georgia, and covers all of Floyd and about half of each neighboring county reliably.  The only other NPR/PRI stations available are WABE FM 90.1 from Atlanta, and WUTC FM 88.1 and WSMC-FM 90.5 from Chattanooga, both of which have marginal to poor reception in the Rome area.  GPB Radio is also usually available on the second audio program of GPB TV station WNGH-TV 18, from near Chatsworth, except for when WNGH is using the SAP channel for other uses.\nThe station broadcasts with a power of 4,200 watts at 241 meters (791 ft) HAAT, and is class C3.  Despite what seems like a low effective radiated power, its height makes it approximately equivalent to the class C3 maximum of 25,000 watts at 100 meters, which gives a reference distance of nearly 40 km or 25 miles from the radio antenna site.  This is the first GPB station, and one of the few non-commercial educational stations in the country, that use a channel outside of the 88-92 MHz reserved band.  WQMT FM 98.9 in Chatsworth was purchased under similar circumstances for $3.2 million and switched to GPB programming on January 2, 2008 as WNGH-FM.  Both stations have a single station ID done together each hour and heard on both stations, indicating they use the same feed.\nIn early February 2013, GPB applied to the FCC to move the station eastward, which would reduce coverage in northeast Alabama and increase it in northwestern metro Atlanta, bringing Cartersville and Acworth within its protected signal contour.  This would increase power from 4.2 to 17.5 kW, but decrease HAAT from 241 to 120 meters (394 ft), leaving the station with approximately the same or slightly greater coverage area, and with greater population within its broadcast range.  This radio tower, just west-northwest of Kingston (34°15′3″N 84°59′5″W), has been used by WTSH-FM 107.1, which is moving south-southwest to a higher tower located west-northwest of Euharlee according to that station's construction permit.  WGPB's application references two other stations in Alabama which would also be moving as the result of its signal being pulled away from that state.\n\nBroadcast translator\nThe station was also assigned broadcast translator W221CG FM 92.1 MHz, licensed to, but not reaching any part of, Kennesaw with 55 watts at 19 meters HAAT.  It was located along Cobb Parkway (U.S. Route 41) on the north-northeast corner of Awtrey Church Road (34°3′57″N 84°43′24″W), west of Acworth and just north of SR 92, and reached as far north as the southern parts of Emerson according to FCC maps.\nIt was owned by Radio Assist Ministry, not GPB/GPTC, and may not have actually been airing WGPB.  It has since been reassigned to relay commercial station WWWQ FM 99.7 MHz, and was sold by RAM to Cumulus Licensing, owner of WWWQ.  The station was moved west-southwest in 2009 to the far exurbs between Dallas and Hiram, and had a construction permit to move between Powder Springs and Austell to serve Lithia Springs on 92.5 MHz, where it became W223BP in early 2012.\n\nSee also\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Formed in 1886, the club was originally not associated with any competition, but entered the senior West Australian Football Association (WAFA) the following season. The club finished last in both its seasons in the competition, merging with the Victorian Football Club on 16 April 1889 to form the Metropolitan Football Club (now the West Perth Football Club).\n\nHistory\nThe club was established as early as mid-1886, when The Daily News was requested by J. Mansfield, the club's secretary, to \"draw the attention of members of the West Australian Football Club to a Special Meeting\" at the Criterion Hotel on 19 July 1886. Two matches were recorded against the Mercantiles team, comprising players from the \"Perth stores\", in August and September 1886. The first match was won by West Australians, and the second by Mercantiles, with both being played at the Old Recreation Ground (now Wellington Square). G. Moffatt was West Australians' captain in both matches.At the May 1887 annual meeting of the West Australian Football Association (WAFA), which itself had been established in May 1885, a letter was read from the West Australian Football Club requesting admission into the league, which was granted. Messrs Mansfield, Ramsay, and McDonough were made delegates of the club to the association. At the same meeting, it was resolved that West Australians would be allowed to play with 23 men on the field (instead of the usual 20), as the majority of the club's players were juniors. The club's guernsey was also designated as red and black hoops. Through the 1887 season, the team struggled to win matches, and in one match lost to the Perth Football Club, a junior team at the time. F. McDonough captained the team in most matches, with R. Ramsay usually serving as vice-captain. The club again struggled to compete in 1888 – in one match, against Unions, the team conceded eight goals, while failing to score a single goal for themselves. On 16 April 1889, a meeting of the West Australian and Victorian Football Clubs was held at the Criterion Hotel, in which it was unanimously decided to amalgamate the two clubs into a single club known as the Metropolitan Football Club, which has survived until the present day as the West Perth Football Club. F. McDonough remained captain of the combined club, while West Australians' club colours of red and black were maintained for the merged club. Overall, in two years in the competition, West Australians played in 17 matches, winning three, drawing one, and losing thirteen, for an overall winning percentage of 20.6%.\nPassage 2:\nGraham Farmer\nGraham Vivian \"Polly\" Farmer  (10 March 1935 – 14 August 2019) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and the East Perth Football Club and West Perth Football Club in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL).\nBorn in Western Australia and of indigenous heritage through his Noongar mother, Farmer is considered one of the greatest footballers in the game's history; when the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established in 1996, Farmer was among the 12 inaugural players given \"legend\" status. He is primarily recognised for the way he revolutionised ruckwork and handballing.\nAfter retiring as a player, Farmer returned to Geelong to become the VFL's first coach of indigenous background, and he was also named coach of Western Australia's first State of Origin team.\nThe Graham Farmer Freeway in his hometown of Perth is named in his honour.\n\nEarly life\nFarmer was born at the Hillcrest Maternity Home in North Fremantle to an unknown man and 25-year-old Noongar woman from Katanning named Eva. At the time of Farmer's birth, Australia was slowly recovering from the Great Depression, and A. O. Neville was Western Australia's Chief Protector of Aborigines. In December 1936, Farmer was voluntarily placed in the care of Sister Kate's orphanage in Queens Park, Western Australia, a home for \"half-caste\" children. Farmer never found out why he had been put there, though it is presumed that Farmer's unmarried mother did not have the means to provide for him.Nonetheless, Farmer was grateful to Sister Kate's for his upbringing: \"If it had not been for Sister Kate's, I would have had an ice block's hope in hell of ever leading a normal life. I owe her and all her dedicated helpers everything – for giving me the chance to make something of myself. I was one of the lucky ones.\" A bout of poliomyelitis left Farmer with his left leg shorter than his right leg. According to Farmer, he was nicknamed \"Polly the Parrot\" as a six-year-old because people thought he chattered away like a parrot. At high school, Farmer was spotted by talent scouts for the East Perth Football Club and joined the team.\n\nFootball career\nEast Perth\nFarmer began his top-level career in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), known then as the West Australian National Football League (WANFL), with the East Perth Football Club in 1953. He played 176 games from 1953 to 1961 with East Perth. During this time he won the club's fairest and best award seven times and was a member of their 1956, 1958 and 1959 premiership teams. In 1956, he was awarded a Simpson Medal for his performance against South Australia at the Perth Carnival and later was also awarded the Tassie Medal for being judged best at the carnival overall. He was awarded the WANFL's highest individual honour, the Sandover Medal, in 1956 and 1960. He also tied for the medal in 1957 with East Fremantle's Jack Clarke but lost on a countback; he was awarded that medal in 1997 when the WAFL awarded retrospective medals for those who missed out on countbacks. In 1959, he was awarded the Simpson Medal for being best on ground in the grand final. He was awarded another Simpson Medal in 1961 for his game against Victoria at the Brisbane Carnival.\n\nGeelong\nFarmer had clear ambitions to play football in Victoria, and had attracted interest from Victorian clubs; at the end of 1955 he was signed by the Richmond Football Club for £200 (as was not uncommon at the time), but the move was blocked by East Perth, and he remained in Perth for the next six years. He was later recruited by Bob Davis to the Geelong Football Club in 1962. In the opening moments of his debut for Geelong in 1962, Farmer severely injured a knee, causing ligament damage andFootball Club ... since its inception in 1934.\"\nIn the initial terms of reference document, there were to be four main categories for entries into the Hall of Fame: \n\nHall of Fame inductees (open to all players, coaches, administrators and volunteers);\nChampion inductees (open to those SDFC players who have been recruited from SDFC into the AFL);\nLegends – open to all Hall of Fame members; and\nIconic Moments, which were defined as \"events which have been game changers for the Club.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nZencap\nZencap was a German company, operating a peer-to-peer lending platform, which allowed private savers to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. Using the crowdfunding model, the company based in Berlin, Germany aimed to create a direct link between private lenders and small businesses seeking loans. As of December 2014, Zencap had facilitated 5 million Euro in loans to small and medium-sized firms.In October 2015, the company was merged with Funding Circle, being active on UK and US.\n\nOrigin\nThe company, based in Berlin, was founded in March 2014 by Christian Grobe and Matthias Knecht, with support from Rocket Internet.\n\nLending\nThe business model resembled the US peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club and UK-based company Funding Circle.\nZencap facilitated small business loans from 10,000 to 250,000 euros.  Zencap determined whether the borrower was creditworthy and assigned a credit grade that determined the payable interest rate and the fees. Zencap itself charged borrowers a 1% to 4.5% origination fee. The loan period ranged between 6 and 60 months while the loan could be repaid without an early repayment fee at any time. Conditions varied between countries.\nDer Tagesspiegel quoted founder Christian Grobe, \"We are very strict with the risk assessment.\" Once approved, businesses posted their loan request on the Zencap marketplace, where private lenders were able to choose which businesses they wanted to lend money to.\n\nFunding Circle acquisition of Zencap\nIn October 2015, Zencap was acquired by UK based Funding Circle, another lending platform in Europe. Zencap was active in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. The merge made Funding Circle one of the main peer to business lending leaders in Europe.\n\nSee also\nDebt-to-income ratio\nComparison of crowd funding services\nDisintermediation\nPassage 2:\nCommon pochard\nThe common pochard (; Aythya ferina) is a medium-sized diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek aithuia, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin  ferina, \"wild game\", from ferus, \"wild\".\n\nDescription\nThe adult male has a long dark bill with a grey band, a red head and neck, a black breast, red eyes and a grey back. The adult female has a brown head and body and a narrower grey bill-band. The triangular head shape is distinctive. Pochards are superficially similar to the closely related North American redhead and canvasback. Females give hoarse growls. Males have whistles cut off by a final nasal note aaoo-oo-haa.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nTheir breeding habitat consists of marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern Europe and across the Palearctic. They are migratory, and spend winter in the south and west of Europe.In the British Isles, birds breed in eastern England and lowland Scotland, in small numbers in Northern Ireland with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. While uncommon, individuals are also occasionally seen in the south of England, and small populations are sometimes observed on the River Thames. Large numbers stay overwinter in Great Britain, after the birds retreat from Russia and Scandinavia.\n\nEcology\nThese are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks such as the tufted duck.\nThese birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. They often feed at night, and will up-end for food as well as the more characteristic diving. According to the article 'Patterns in the diving behaviour of the pochard, Aythya ferina: a test of an optimality model' Pochard's have a behavioral preference when it comes to their feeding patterns. This behavioral preference is that Pochards prefer shallower water in comparison to deeper water even though the food concentration in deeper water may be higher.In a number of countries the population of Common Pochard is decreasing mainly due to urbanization of the natural habitats and their transformation, as well as due to overhunting.\nThe pochard is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nBusiness Growth Fund\nBGF, established in 2011 as the Business Growth Fund, is an investment company that provides growth capital for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK and Ireland.From a network of 16 offices in the UK and Ireland, the company has invested more than £3 billion in more than 400 small and mid-sized companies. Around three-quarters of its investments have been in companies based outside London and South East England.BGF typically takes minority, non-controlling shareholdings in investee companies. BGF has completed more than 150 exits by selling businesses in its portfolio.\n\nHistory\nBGF was founded in 2011 by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered banks, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.The launch followed lobbying of both Conservative and Labour politicians by businessman Sir Nigel Rudd, who had argued for the creation of an organisation to provide equity funding to help close a perceived funding gap for small and mid-sized businesses. A shortfall in funding for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK had been identified as long ago as 1931 by the Macmillan Committee.BGF was seen as a successor to the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), set up by the Bank of England in 1945 and subsequently renamed 3i. BGF has been described as the “modern 3i”.Stephen Welton, founding CEO, said that a new organisation was needed because 3i’s business model, in line with the private equity industry generally, had evolved to focus on large buyout deals, meaning it had less of a focus on providing growth capital to small and mid-sized businesses.In 2017, BGF opened an office in Dublin to administer a €250 million fund to invest in small and mid-sized Irish companies. The Irish fund is backed by AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and BGF’s existing shareholders.BGF’s model has been replicated in Canada with the Canadian Business Growth Fund, launched in 2018 and backed by financial institutions including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Manulife. In 2019, the Australian Business Growth Fund was launched with backing from banks including Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank.\nThe Broads Special Area of Conservation.This area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds provides a spillway for the River Chet. The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. Three rare flies have been recorded, Elachiptera uniseta, Elachiptera scrobiculata and Lonchoptera scutellata.The site is open to  the public.\nPassage 5:\nChina IPR SME Helpdesk\nThe China IPR SME Helpdesk is a project funded by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR). It provides European  small and medium-sized enterprises with free, practical support on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China. According to its website, The China IPR SME Helpdesk's mission is to \"support European Union (EU) small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to both protect and enforce their Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in or relating to China, through the provision of free information and services\".A pilot programme of The China IPR SME Helpdesk was established in 2008 under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and it was announced in January 2011 that the Helpdesk project has been extended for an additional three years (through the end of 2013).\nPassage 6:\nScathophaga\nThe genus Scathophaga are small to medium sized predatory flies that for the most part, have larvae that feed on other insect larva within animal dung or decaying vegetable matter. Many are highly variable, sometimes producing small, infertile males that superficially resemble females. This species is an example of an organism which may selectively store the sperm of multiple males, as females have three to four spermathecae.\n\nSpecies\nThese 99 species belong to the genus Scathophaga:\n\nData sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net\nPassage 7:\nPalmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge\nThe Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge is located in Alaska, south of Wasilla and north of Anchorage. It is composed of 28,800 acres (11,655 ha; 45 sq mi) of coastal marshy areas adjacent to Knik Arm that support populations of moose, muskrat, foxes, coyotes, eagles, and migratory waterfowl. In springtime, tens of thousands of migratory geese, swans, shoebirds, and ducks rest and refuel. Many of these stay in the summer. The Knik River, the Matanuska River, Rabbit Slough, Wasilla Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Spring Creek flow through it.It is a popular location for hunting, skiing, iceskating, and hiking, and other uses.  It is bisected by the Glenn Highway.\nIt can be accessed at Rabbit Slough, from the Glenn Highway, Nelson Road, Scout Ridge and other locations.\n\nHistory\nAn indigenous people called the Knikatnu first settled the land that would become the Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge before Alaskan annexation into the United States. The indigenous people left behind a trail that would become the Iditarod Trail. Prior to the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the land was dry grassland. The name of the refuge stems from the hay farming that went on before the earthquake.\nPassage 8:\nGobizkorea\nThe GobizKOREA is operated by Korean SBC (Small & Medium Business Corporation), a non-profit, government-funded organization established to implement government policies and programs for the growth and development of Korean Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

It rises in Poringland and flows eastwards through Alpington, Bergh Apton, Thurton and Loddon. At Loddon it passes under the A146 through Loddon Mill and into Loddon Staithe. From this point onwards the river is navigable. It then passes Hardley Flood to the north, a nature reserve part-managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The river finally joins the River Yare one mile west of Reedham at Hardley Cross, erected in 1676, which marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and the Borough of Great Yarmouth. The total navigable length is some 3½ miles.\n\nFishing\nFishing is permitted between Loddon and Hardley Cross, bream and roach being the most common catch.\n\nChurches\nA number of churches along the river are known as the \"Chet Valley Churches\". Most belong to the Church of England but they include the Church in Loddon, a combined Anglican and Methodist congregation.\nPassage 10:\nChañaral Island\nIsla Chañaral (sometimes referred to as Isla Chanaral or Chanaral Island) is located 6 km off-shore from the northern Central Chilean coast, some 100 km north of the city of La Serena. Together with Isla Choros and Isla Damas, the island forms the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve, which is administered by the Chilean Forestry Corporation. All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American marine otter. In recent years the reserve has experienced a strong increase in tourist activities, mainly due to being an important feeding ground in the summer months of different marine mammal species like fin whales, blue whales, humpback whales, and bottlenose dolphins that reside in the waters of the reserve. The local fishermen formed an association in cooperation with the National Tourism Service Sernatur to conduct whale watching activities in a sustainable manner, implementing responsible whale watching guidelines.\nIsla Chañaral is the biggest of the reserve's islands. Access to the island restricted by permit only. The island consists of two plateau levels. The main plateau between 50 and 70 meters above sea level is divided into a western and an eastern part by a second high plateau (>100 m). The vegetation of the plateaus differs considerably. While the main plateau is dominated by shrub and cacti the high plateau has a barren appearance with only few small cactus aggregations.\n\nExternal links and references\nChanaral Island: the biggest Humboldt Penguin Colony in the world\nThe Humboldt Penguin Colonies at Chanaral Island, Chile\nHumboldt penguins from the International Penguin Conservation Web Site\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMimosa\nMimosa is a genus of about 590 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μῖμος (mimos), an \"actor\" or \"mime\", and the feminine suffix -osa, \"resembling\", suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is Mimosa tenuiflora, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe taxonomy of the genus Mimosa has gone through several periods of splitting and lumping, ultimately accumulating over 3,000 names, many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera. In part due to these changing circumscriptions, the name \"Mimosa\" has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves, but are now classified in other genera. The most common examples of this are Albizia julibrissin (Persian silk tree) and Acacia dealbata (wattle).\n\nDescription\nMembers of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement; examples outside of Mimosa include the telegraph plant, Aldrovanda, some species of Drosera and the Venus flytrap. The leaves of the Mimosa pudica close quickly when touched. Some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night, and experiments done by Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks.Mimosa can be distinguished from the large related genera, Acacia and Albizia, since its flowers have ten or fewer stamens. Botanically, what appears to be a single globular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones. Mimosas contain some level of heptanoic acid.\n\nSpecies\nThere are about 590 species including:\nMimosa aculeaticarpa Ortega\nMimosa andina Benth.\nMimosa arenosa (Willd.)

It is native to the Caribbean, Central America and South America. It is a short, low-lying shrub with minuscule thorns lining its stem-like hairs.Mimosa somnians is notable for exhibiting rapid plant movement. Its leaves are sensitive to tactile stimulus, folding quickly when touched, similar to Mimosa pudica. It can be differentiated from Mimosa pudica in that its leaves are bipinnate, there are more than four subbranchlets and these originate from more than one point on the branch.Mimosa somnians's leaflets are 4–5 mm long. The flowers form pink balls. It propagates by seeds.\n\nForms, subspecies and varieties\nMimosa somnians f. viscida\nMimosa somnians subsp. longipes \nMimosa somnians subsp. viscida\nMimosa somnians var. aquatica\nMimosa somnians var. deminuta\nMimosa somnians var. diminuta\nMimosa somnians var. glandulosa\nMimosa somnians var. lasiocarpa\nMimosa somnians var. leptocaulis\nMimosa somnians var. longipes\nMimosa somnians var. lupulina\nMimosa somnians var. possensis\nMimosa somnians var. somnians\nMimosa somnians var. velascoensis\nMimosa somnians var. viscida\n\nUses\nIn Guyana, it is used to calm down irritable children via washing.\n\nChemical constituents\nMimosa somnians contains (whole plant) about 0.029% tryptamine and about 0.029% methyltryptamine.\nPassage 3:\nMimosa turneri\nMimosa turneri, the desert mimosa, is a perennial small- to medium-sized shrub native to the Southern United States and particularly abundant in Texas. It grows between 3.5 and 10 feet (1.1 and 3.0 m) tall and produces pink flowers. In many places it is considered a weed because it can grow invasively in moist soils.\n\nHabitat and ecology\nThis species grows as a small to medium-sized shrub that is.  The solution is drunk until the symptoms subside.One preliminary clinical study found Mimosa tenuiflora to be effective in treating venous leg ulcerations.Aqueous extracts of Mimosa are widely used for wound healing and burns in Middle and South America. Consequently, the products of the plant (generally grouped under the term \"Tepezcohuite\") have become a popular and easily produced cosmetic ingredient in commercial skincare products, used and marketed by celebrities including Kylie Jenner and Salma Hayek.\n\nOther uses\nThe tree is an acceptable source of forage or fodder for animals, providing vital protein and other nutrients.  It does well in the dry season and in drought, while providing life saving food for local livestock and animals.  Cows, goats and sheep eat the pods and leaves.  There seems to be evidence that Mimosa tenuiflora forage or fodder cause development defects to pregnant ruminants in Brazil.The tree is an important source of forage for bees, especially during the dry season and in the beginning of the wet season.\nLike most plants in the family Fabaceae, Mimosa tenuiflora fertilizes the soil via nitrogen fixing bacteria.  The tree is useful in fighting soil erosion and for reforestation.\n\nMimosa tenuiflora is a very good source of fuel wood and works very well for making posts, most likely because of its high tannin content (16%), which protects it from rot.  Due to its high tannin content, the bark of the tree is widely used as a natural dye and in leather production.  It is used to make bridges, buildings, fences, furniture and wheels.  It is an excellent source of charcoal and at least one study has been done to see why this is the case.The healing properties of the tree make it useful in treating domestic animals.  A solution of the leaves or bark can also be used for washing animals in the prevention of parasites.  Because the tree keeps most of its leaves during the dry season, it is an important source of shade for animals and plants during that time.\n\nChemistry\nThe bark is known to be rich in tannins, saponins, alkaloids, lipids, phytosterols, glucosides, xylose, rhamnose, arabinose, lupeol, methoxychalcones, and kukulkanins.  Additionally, Mimosa hostilis contains labdane diterpenoids.\n\nEntheogenic uses\nMimosa tenuiflora is an entheogen used by the Jurema Cult (O Culto da Jurema) in northeastern Brazil. Dried Mexican Mimosa tenuiflora root bark has been recently shown to have a dimethyltryptamine (DMT) content of about 1-1.7%.  The stem bark has about 0.03% DMT.The parts of the tree are traditionally used in northeastern Brazil in a psychoactive decoction also called Jurema or Yurema. Analogously, the traditional Western Amazonian sacrament Ayahuasca is brewed from indigenous ayahuasca vines.\nHowever, to date no β-carbolines such as harmala alkaloids have been detected in Mimosa tenuiflora decoctions, yet the Jurema is used in combination with several plants.This presents challenges to the pharmacological understanding of how DMT from the plant is rendered orally active as an entheogen, because the psychoactivity of ingested DMT requires the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as a β-carboline. If an MAOI is neither present in the plant nor added to the mixture, the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) will metabolize DMT in the human gut, preventing the active molecule from entering the blood and brain.\nThe plant is also used in clandestine manufacture of crystalline DMT. In this form, it is psychoactive by itself when vaporized and inhaled.\nThe isolation of the chemical compound yuremamine from Mimosa tenuiflora as reported in 2005 represents a new class of phytoindoles, which may explain an apparent oral activity of DMT in Jurema.\n\nCultivation\nFor outside planting, USDA Zone 9 or higher is recommended.In nature, Mimosa tenuiflora \"[...] fruits and seeds are disseminated by the wind in a radius of 5–8 m (16–26 ft) from the mother plant; rain carries them from slopes to lower plains and human activities contribute to their dissemination.\"For cultivation, the seed pods are collected once they start to spontaneously open on the tree.  The collected pods are laid out in the sun so that the pods open up and release their seeds.  The seeds can then be planted in sandy soil with sun exposure.\nScarification of the seed via mechanical means or by using sulfuric acid greatly increases the germination rate of the seeds over non-treatment.  The seeds can be sown directly into holes in the ground or planted in prepared areas.\nThe seeds can germinate in temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C, but the highest germination rate occurs at around 25 °C (about 96%), even after four years of storage.  Germination takes about 2–4 weeks.\nIt is also possible to propagate Mimosa tenuiflora via cuttings.Trimming adult Mimosa tenuiflorae during the rainy season is not recommended as it can kill them.\n\nLegal status\nUnited Nations\nSee also\nDimethyltryptamine\nPsychedelic plants\nPassage 10:\nMimosa texana\nMimosa texana is a shrub in the family Fabaceae. It is commonly known as the Texas mimosa, the Texas catclaw or the Wherry mimosa and is endemic to upland regions of Mexico and Texas. This species used to be classified as Mimosa biuncifera but it was found that phenotypic variations occurred across its range and a new taxonomy was proposed by Rupert C. Barneby in 1986, splitting the species into Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera and Mimosa texana.\n\nDistribution\nTexas mimosa is found on alkaline soils in Mexico and Zapata and Starr counties in the state of Texas. It is uncommon and grows on caliche and gravelly hillsides.\n\nDescription\nThis species is a straggly, much branched, deciduous shrub of up to two metres tall. It has slender, zigzag, dark coloured twigs clad in backward pointing prickles. The alternate bi-pinnate leaves have medium-sized leaflets. The globular flowers are creamy-white and cover the bush in the spring. They are intensely fragrant and attract numerous insects. The seed pods are brick red and flattened, with prickly edges.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBennington Triangle\n\"Bennington Triangle\" is a phrase coined by American author Joseph A. Citro to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1945 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including Shadow Child, in which Citro devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in Southeastern Massachusetts.\nPrecisely what area is encompassed in this hypothetical \"mystery triangle\" is not clear, but it is purportedly centered on Glastenbury Mountain and would include some or most of the area of the towns immediately surrounding it, especially Bennington, Woodford, Shaftsbury, and Somerset. Glastenbury and its neighboring township Somerset were both once moderately thriving logging and industrial towns, but began declining toward the late 19th century and are now essentially ghost towns, unincorporated by an act of the Vermont General Assembly in 1937.\nAccording to Citro's books, stories of strange happenings had been told about Glastonbury and the surrounding area for many years, the best-known of which is probably that of the disappearance of Paula Jean Welden.\n\nReported disappearances\nMiddie Rivers (1945)\nBetween 1945 and 1950, five people disappeared in the area surrounding Bennington, Vermont. The first disappearance occurred on November 12, 1945, when 74-year-old Middie Rivers disappeared while out hunting, in the vicinity of Long Trail Road and Vermont Route 9. Rivers was on a weekend hunting trip with four other hunters up the mountains. The morning of November 12, 1945, Rivers and his son-in-law, Joe Lauzon, were walking together before reaching a fork. Rivers and Lauzon would separate here with Rivers telling Lauzon he'd \"only be going a short distance\" before he would join them at camp for lunch. As 3pm had come and gone, the rest of the hunting party would begin searching before getting authorities. An extensive search was conducted, but the only evidence discovered was a single rifle cartridge that was found in a stream. The speculation was that Rivers had leaned over and the cartridge had dropped out of his pocket into the water. Rivers was an experienced outdoorsman who was familiar with the local area.\n\nPaula Welden (1946)\nPaula Jean Welden, aged 18, disappeared on December 1, 1946. Welden, a sophomore at Bennington College, had set out for a hike on the Long Trail. Many saw her depart, including Ernest Whitman, a Bennington Banner employee who gave her directions. She was not wearing a jacket during her journey; it was 50 °F outside, later dropping to 9 °F. Welden was alleged to have been seen on the trail itself by an elderly couple who were about 100 yards (91 m) behind her. According to them, she turned a corner in the trail, and when they reached the same corner she had disappeared. An extensive search was conducted, which included the posting of a $5,000 reward and help from the FBI, but no evidence of her was ever found. Welden's disappearance was the inspiration for the 1951 novel Hangsaman by Shirley Jackson.\n\nJames Tedford (1949)\nJames E. Tedford, a veteran, allegedly went missing on December 1, 1949, three years to the day after Welden was last seen. Tedford, a resident of the Bennington Soldiers' Home, had been in St. Albans visiting relatives and was accompanied to a local bus station, which was the last location where he was seen. According to witnesses, Tedford got on the bus and was still aboard at the last stop before arriving in Bennington. Somewhere between the last stop and Bennington, he vanished. His belongings were still in the luggage rack and an open bus timetable was on his vacant seat. Tony Jinks discusses this claim, saying that \"The popular conception is that he vanished into thin air while on the bus, but like many missing person stories there's a gap between when he was last seen and when he was reported missing a week or so later. Regarding Tedford's disappearance, there's enough evidence to suggest he didn’t \"dematerialize,” even though no trace of him was ever found.\"\n\nPaul Jepson (1950)\nOn October 12, 1950, Paul Jepson, aged 8, had accompanied his mother in a truck. She left her son unattended for about an hour while she fed some pigs. When she returned, her son was nowhere in sight. Search parties were formed to look for the child. Nothing was ever found, though Jepson was wearing a bright red jacket that should have made him more visible. According to one story, bloodhounds tracked the boy to a local highway where, according to local legend, Welden had disappeared four years earlier.\n\nFrieda Langer (1950)\nOn October 28, 1950, sixteen days after Jepson had vanished, Frieda Langer, aged 53, and her cousin, Herbert Elsner, left their family campsite near the Somerset Reservoir to go on a hike. During the journey, Langer slipped and fell into a stream. She told Elsner if he would wait, she would go back to the campsite, change clothes and catch up to him. When she did not return, Elsner made his way back to the campsite and discovered that Frieda Langer had not returned, and that nobody had seen her since they had left. Over the next two weeks, five searches were conducted, involving aircraft, helicopters, and up to 300 searchers. No trace of Langer was found during the search.\nOn May 12, 1951, Frieda Langer's body was found three and a half miles from the campsite in the eastern branch of the Deerfield River, an area that had been only lightly searched seven months previously. No cause of death could be determined because of the condition of her remains. No direct connections have been identified that tie these cases together, other than the general geographic area and time period.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Bennington Triangle was discussed in Season 3, Episode 8 of the television program William Shatner's Weird or What? The episode, entitled \"Mysterious Vanishings,\" first aired on July 23, 2012.The events of 1945 to 1950 are told in episode 67 of Lore, titled \"The Red Coats\".The Bennington Triangle was featured as one of the haunted locations in the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places in America which aired on the Travel Channel in 2018. The episode, title \"Unnatural World\" told the stories about the reportedly missing persons in a five-year span, and local lore of the \"Bennington Monster\", a Bigfoot-like creature that supposedly roams these wooded areas.The Bennington Triangle is discussed in Episode 374 of the podcast Myudgie: A creature from Algonquian folklore. The local Wampanoag people consider them to be dangerous tricksters. They have been especially associated with the Freetown State Forest within the Bridgewater Triangle.\n\nSee also\nLovecraft Country\nPukwudgie\nPassage 8:\nContext-sensitive solutions (transport)\nContext-sensitive solutions (CSS) is a theoretical and practical approach to transportation decision-making and design that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass (\"the context\"). The term is closely related to but distinguishable from context-sensitive design in that it asserts that all decisions in transportation planning, project development, operations, and maintenance should be responsive to the context in which these activities occur, not simply the design process. CSS seeks to balance the need to move vehicles efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including historic preservation, environmental sustainability, and the creation of vital public spaces. In transit projects, CSS generally refers to context sensitive planning, design, and development around transit stations, also known as transit-oriented development.\n\nOverview\nIn contrast to long-standing practices in transportation design that place primary importance on moving traffic (vehicular throughput), the CSS process emphasizes that transportation facilities should fit their physical settings and preserve scenic, aesthetic, historic and environmental resources, while maintaining safety and mobility. For instance, if a state highway that passes through a downtown main street, applying CSS principles would entail creating a street where the movement of vehicles does not impede pedestrian activity and sidewalk commerce, rather than a street that is simply widened and straightened to increase speed, capacity and mobility for vehicles as a singular transportation objective. CSS therefore includes principles for context-sensitive decision-making that place a high value on community input and consensus, and more technical principles of context sensitive design.\nWhen CSS principles are applied to transportation projects, the process involves a much broader range of disciplines than traditional transportation design methods, which rely exclusively on the judgment of traffic engineers. CSS is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves everyone with a significant stake in the project, such as the residents, businesses and local institutions that will be affected by an intervention or a failure to address the transportation implications of development such as congestion. Rather than approaching these stakeholders at the tail end of the design process in an attempt to gain approval, CSS emphasizes the need to incorporate their feedback from the very outset of the planning and design development processes and during all subsequent stages of construction, operations and maintenance.\n\nQualities of a CSS project\nThe following list of qualities (developed at a 1998 conference for transportation planners called \"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\") describe the core goals of the CSS process.\n\nThe CSS Product: Qualities of Excellence in Transportation DesignThe \"Qualities that Characterize Excellence in Transportation Design\" – that is, of the physical end product of the CSS process – are: \n\nThe project satisfies the purpose and needs as agreed to by a full range of stakeholders.\nThis agreement is forged in the earliest phase of the project and amended as warranted as the project develops.\nThe project is a safe facility for both the user and the community.\nThe project is in harmony with the community, and it preserves environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, and natural resource values of the area, i.e., exhibits context sensitive design.\nThe project exceeds the expectations of both designers and stakeholders and achieves a level of excellence in people's minds.\nThe project involves efficient and effective use of the resources (time, budget, community) of all involved parties.\nThe project is designed and built with minimal disruption to the community.\nThe project is seen as having added lasting value to the community.\n\nThe CSS process\nThis outline of the core steps in the CSS process was also developed at the \"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\" conference.\n\nThe CSS Process: Characteristics of the Process That Yield Excellence\"The Characteristics of the Process that will Yield Excellence in Transportation Design\" are: \n\nCommunication with all stakeholders is open, honest, early, and continuous.\nA multidisciplinary team is established early, with disciplines based on the needs of the specific project, and with the inclusion of the public.\nA full range of stakeholders is involved with transportation officials in the scoping phase (the period before design is begun when the scope of the project is agreed upon). The purposes of the project are clearly defined, and consensus on the scope is forged before proceeding.\nThe highway development process is tailored to meet the circumstances. This process should examine multiple alternatives that will result in a consensus of approach methods.\nA commitment to the process from top agency officials and local leaders is secured.\nThe public involvement process, which includes informal meetings, is tailored to the project.\nThe landscape, the community, and valued resources are understood before engineering design is started. A full range of tools for communication about project alternatives is used (e.g., visualization).\n\nHistory\nThe initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 \"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\" conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments along with economic and social assets for neighborhoods they pass through. In 2003, the Federal Highway Administration announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they had a target goal of  achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) is now (fall 2006) developing strategic goals and objectives for CSS which it describes as a \"fundamental change in the way we do business.\" One principal element of this change is the way transportation planners and engineers address speed. Historically, the speed at which a vehicle can safely travel through the landscape has been regarded as a primary goal of transportation planning since it shortens travel time, saves money (time is money), and improves driver convenience. However, CSS recognizes that designing a facility for the maximum safe speed that is economically feasible can be detrimental to other community goals, and even to vehicle passengers themselves. CSS recognizes that the goal of transportation is social and economic exchange, which cannot occur at high speeds. Instead, CSS attempts to identify, through a community-based process, a  \"target speed\" that promotes the optimum amount of social and economic exchange, with lowest environmental impacts, that is appropriate for the context. Thus, in cities, if higher vehicle speeds lower the amount of social exchange on a residential street (fewer friends, less street life etc.) then the street will be designed to encourage drivers to slow down so as not to reduce social exchange. In a similar manner, commercial streets will be designed to maximize commercial exchange and designed accordingly. In more rural areas where a primary goal is to move people and goods between human settlements, CSS can be compatible with much higher design speeds. Setting a target speed that is appropriate for the context, and then designing roads, highway and streets to make it difficult for drivers to exceed that target speed, is a central CSS principle and represents a fundamental shift in transportation planning practice.\n\nSee also\nTransportation planning\nComplete streets\nPlacemaking\nNew Urbanism\nTransit-oriented development\nTown meeting\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It is a subsidiary of FEMSA which owns 47.8% of its stock, with 27.8% held by wholly owned subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company and the remaining 25% listed publicly on the Mexican Stock Exchange (since 1993) and the New York Stock Exchange (since 1998). It is the largest franchise Coca-Cola bottler in the world, the company has operations in Latin America, although its largest and most profitable market is in Mexico.\n\nHistory\nCoca-Cola FEMSA began as a joint venture with The Coca-Cola Company in 1991 with FEMSA initially owning 51% of the stock. It started expanding its international operations in 2003 when it acquired Panamerican Beverages (Panamco), another Mexican Coca-Cola bottler with operations in Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. It later acquired additional bottling companies in Brazil (its second largest market) as well as the main Coca-Cola bottler in the Philippines in 2013, until 2018 when the company was then renamed to Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines.In 2007, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Jugos del Valle in a joint venture with The Coca-Cola Company. In June 2008, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Refrigerantes Minas Gerais.In 2011, the company merged Grupo Tampico and Corporación Los Angeles. Later that same year, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Grupo Industrias Lacteas in a joint venture with The Coca-Cola Company.Coca-Cola FEMSA merged beverage operations with Grupo Fomento Queretano in 2012. In 2013, the company merged more bottling operations with Grupo Yoli as well as acquiring Brazilian companies Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes and Industria Brasileira de Bebidas.In 2015, Coca-Cola FEMSA opened two $500 million bottling plants in Itabirito, Brazil, and Tocancipa, Colombia. The company completed its $1 billion acquisition of VONPAR in Brazil in 2016. Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola FEMSA also bought the AdeS brand from Unilever in a joint venture that same year.In 2018, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Guatemalan bottlers ABASA and Los Volcanes as well as MONRESA in Uruguay.\n\nSee also\nList of companies traded on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores\nList of companies of Mexico\nEconomy of Mexico\nPassage 2:\nCornelio Velásquez\nCornelio H. Velásquez (born September 28, 1968, in Panama City, Panama) is a jockey in American Thoroughbred horse racing. He was introduced to horse racing at age fifteen by trainer Carlos Salazar Guardia in his native Panama and enrolled in the national jockey school. In his first year of racing he was his country's top apprentice jockey and was the leading rider again in 1994 and 1995.\nIn 1996 Cornelio Velasquez emigrated to the United States to race at Elmont, New York's Belmont Park. During the ensuing ten years he competed at meets at tracks in Kentucky and Florida, winning several riding titles. His big break came in 2003 when he won his first Breeders' Cup on Cajun Beat in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. A two-time winner of Breeders' Cup races, in 2005 Velasquez rode Closing Argument to a second-place finish in the Kentucky Derby and in 2007 is scheduled to compete on the well-regarded colt, Nobiz Like Shobiz.\nPassage 3:\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nThe Coca-Cola Company is an American multinational corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The drink industry company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The company's stock is listed on the NYSE and is part of the DJIA and the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indexes.\nThe soft drink was developed in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton. At the time it was introduced, the product contained cocaine from coca leaves and caffeine from kola nuts which together acted as a stimulant. The coca and the kola are the source of the product name, and led to Coca-Cola's promotion as a \"healthy tonic\". Pemberton had been severely wounded in the American Civil War, and had become addicted to the pain medication morphine. He developed the beverage as a patent medicine in an effort to control his addiction.\nIn 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. The company has operated a franchised distribution system since 1889. The company largely produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold exclusive territories. The company owns its anchor bottler in North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments.\n\nHistory\nIn July 1886, pharmacist John Stith Pemberton from Columbus, Georgia invented the original Coca-Cola drink, which was advertised as helpful in the relief of headache, to be placed on sale primarily in drugstores as a medicinal beverage. Pemberton had made many mixing experiments and reached his goal during the month of May, but the new product was as yet unnamed and uncarbonated. Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, is credited with naming the product and creating its logo. Robinson chose the name Coca-Cola because of its two main ingredients (coca leaves and kola nuts) and because it is an alliteration. John Pemberton had taken a break and left Robinson to make, promote, and sell Coca-Cola on his own. Robinson promoted the drink with the limited budget that he had, and succeeded.American businessman Asa Griggs Candler purchased the Coca-Cola formula and brand, forming the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. By 1895, Coca-Cola was being sold nationwide. In 1919, the company was sold to Ernest Woodruff's Trust Company of Georgia.Coca-Cola's first ad read \"Coca Cola. Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!\"which offered ca. 9,000 products, Alko of Finland with ca. 3,000 products available, or British Waitrose with ca. 1,500 products available. By the end of 2016, the range of products had reached near 17,000 items.\n\nCorruption cases\nIn what is known as Dysthesaken (the Dysthe case) in 1930 exposed flaws in the goods acquisition procedures of Vinmonopolet, and as a consequence changes were made to the procedures. The leadership were sentenced for combining company and personal interests, and the influence and power of individuals in purchasing decisions were reduced after the process. Following this, a law of 19 July 1931 (Vinmonopolloven, the wine monoploy law) came into effect.\nEkjordsaken, (the Ekjord case) uncovered in 2005, brought new allegations of corruption against employees and leadership of Vinmonopolet. A probe led by Erling Grimstad exposed that the importer firm Ekjord A/S over the course of several years had sponsored outlet leaders by arranging luxury dining and accommodations as well as other gifts in order to influence purchases and placement of their products within the stores. Membership in this exclusive group was symbolized by the gift of a tastevin. Several Vinmonopolet leaders admitted to having received wines and other perks, which led to reprimands of 9 individuals, two of whom were dismissed.The initiating factor came when  an employee who had been fired from Ekjord A/S, sued against wrongful dismissal. The scandal escalated as the media discovered the particulars of the lawsuit, with Lindin as the chief source of allegations that would result in wide consequences. During the trial the elaborate \"grease culture\" in the company Ekjord A/S was uncovered. Knut Grøholt withdrew from the position of CEO of Vinmonopolet later that year, and in August 2006 was replaced by Kai G. Henriksen.\n\nVinbladet\nHaving long planned to publish a magazine aimed at consumers as was already done by Systembolaget in Sweden, in 1988 Vinmonopolet launched Vinbladet (\"The Wine Magazine\" or \"The Vine Leaf\"), distributed to customers free of charge. The magazine's name had been used precisely 60 years previously for the internal publication which provided information to employees about the sold goods. The rationale was that as Vinmonopolet were in the business of selling culture, they wanted to do so with culture, making information available crucial.A professional editor was engaged, and the publication printed on glossy paper contained images of a commercial nature depicting the diverse nations' wine regions and wine production, and articles on various subjects connected to food, wine and spirits. The Norwegian temperance movement reacted negatively and responded with press declarations accusing Vinmonopolet of attempting to popularise alcohol use, rather than limit it. The criticism from the temperance movement also maintained that the alcohol in wine did not distinguish itself from the alcohol in hard spirits, that \"fine dining\" customs functioned as a gateway to alcohol problems, and that the cultural projects of Vinmonopolet could well lead to family tragedies, destroyed lives, fear and death.\n\nNotable past products\nRødvin\nWhen the German occupation forces withdrew from Norway in 1945, there remained behind 400,000 litres of Bordeaux wine which became the foundation of the generic \"Rødvin\" (\"Red wine\"), the best selling wine in Norway over several decades, which is accredited as a cornerstone in \"cultivating Norwegian drinking culture\". Nicknamed \"Château Hasle\" (from the location name of the Vinmonopolet headquarters) and  \"Sekskroners\" (\"costing six kroner\"), sales of the brand are estimated in excess of 120 million litres, it eventually ceased being the national top seller due to the arrival of inexpensive Chilean and Italian wines by 1998.The initial blends consisting of Bordeaux wines from the 1934 and 1937 vintages, along with simple German and Italian wine, were sold from 1 January 1946 for NOK total of 4.50, both Rødvin and Hvitvin (White wine), all sold out by 1947. As the successive imports of wine from Algeria, Tunisia and Chile marketed under other names failed to sell well, an initiative was made in 1949 to compose a new blended wine for the people, affordable and easily drinkable. Purchasing director Haakon Svensson was given a set budget and assigned to negotiate deals with wine producers, initially securing deals with winemakers from Le Midi, Valencia and Algeria, with an aim to produce a blended wine that could decrease the Norwegian people's vast consumption of liquor, at the time ten to one the ratio of the consumption of wine.On sale from 1 February 1950 at the total price of NOK 6 (NOK 4 + 50% tax), the price remained fixed until 1968, causing it to be widely known as \"the six kroner wine\". By 1970 it cost NOK 7, and by 1990 it had risen to NOK 43. Normally blended from 5 to 10 wines, from locations that later also included Cyprus and Turkey, Rødvin was in 1972 responsible for 40% of all wine sold in Norway, leading up to the peak of its popularity in the 1980s. In 1981 there was sold 3.8 million liter, while by 2000 Rødvin production had been transferred to Arcus and annual sales had decreased to 700,000 liters.In August 2014 it was announced that bottles of Rødvin would be removed from the standard Vinmonopolet shelf selection by the following October, following a run of 54 vintages, after this to be available by order under the altered name \"Folkets Originale Rødvin\" (the people's original red wine).\n\nGolden Power\nGolden Power was a Norwegian-produced sparkling fruit wine (not to be confused with an energy drink of the same name), made of 70% rhubarb, 20% apple and 10% grape juice, which was produced by Vingården (the Røed farm in Filtvet, in the Tofte area, in Hurum), associated with owner Frantz Michaelsen. The product was removed from Vinmonopolet selection in 2006.\nVingården was considered part of the local culture, and Golden Power deemed by some a rare, innovative Norwegian product. Traditions of winemaking were established in 1886, and Vingården came to have a production capacity of some 800,000 litres while the production process of Golden Power was claimed to last for four years.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nList of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt episodes\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is an American sitcom created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, starring Ellie Kemper in the title role, that has streamed on Netflix since March 6, 2015. Originally set for a 13-episode first season on NBC for spring 2015, the show was sold to Netflix and given a two-season order. The fourth and final season concluded on January 25, 2019. On May 8, 2019, it was announced that the series would return with an interactive special, which premiered on May 12, 2020.\nDuring the course of the series, 52 episodes of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt were released over four seasons.\nThe series follows 29-year-old Kimmy Schmidt (Kemper) as she adjusts to life in New York City after her rescue from a doomsday cult in Indiana where she and three other women had been held by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm) for 15 years. Determined to be seen as something other than a victim and armed only with a positive attitude, Kimmy decides to restart her life by moving to New York City, where she quickly befriends her street-wise landlady Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane), finds a roommate in struggling actor Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess), and gains a job as a nanny for the melancholy and out-of-touch socialite Jacqueline Voorhees (Jane Krakowski). With their help, Kimmy struggles to adapt to an unfamiliar world and jump-start the adult life that had been taken away from her.\n\nSeries overview\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2015)\nSeason 2 (2016)\nSeason 3 (2017)\nSeason 4 (2018–19)\nSpecial (2020)\nPassage 2:\nRobert Carlock\nRobert Morgan Carlock (born September 21, 1972) is an American screenwriter and producer. He has worked as a writer for several NBC television comedies, and as a showrunner for 30 Rock, which was created by his recurring collaborator, comedian Tina Fey. He co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt with Fey. He co-created the television show Mr. Mayor starring Ted Danson, again with Fey.\n\nEarly life\nCarlock was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, the son of Martha and Roger Emery Carlock. Raised in Weston, Massachusetts, he graduated from Belmont Hill School in 1991 and cum laude from Harvard University in 1995, where he became president of the Fly Club, an all-male social club, and an editor for the Harvard Lampoon.\n\nCareer\nCarlock began writing for the Dana Carvey Show in 1996. Following that, he was a member of the writing staff of Saturday Night Live from 1996 to 2001, contributing to 99 episodes of the show. One of his notable SNL sketches was NPR's Delicious Dish with Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon. In 2011, Ben and Jerry's released a new ice cream flavor based on the sketch written by Carlock and named it \"Schweddy Balls\".Carlock left SNL in 2001 to write for Friends in Los Angeles, working on the show until 2004 when he joined the staff of Friends spinoff Joey for two years. Carlock then moved back to New York to work on an \"Untitled Tina Fey Project\" in 2006, which became 30 Rock, which he wrote for and produced. He then worked on Fey's next sitcom, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which debuted in 2015. He also wrote the screenplay for Fey's film Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016).\nCarlock has won several awards for his work on 30 Rock, including Primetime Emmys, Writers Guild of America Awards, and Producers Guild of America Awards, as well as being named one of the top 50 power showrunners of 2011.In 2021, Carlock co-created the series Mr. Mayor with Fey which premiered on NBC on January 7, 2021. The series has received generally positive reviews from critics. In April 2021, the series was renewed for a second season.\n\nPersonal life\nOn December 31, 2001, Carlock married Jennifer Nielsen Rogers, a Wellesley graduate and former CNNfn producer/reporter. Rogers now works as an anchor for Yahoo Finance. She was previously an anchor and reporter for Reuters TV.\n\nFilmography\nAwards and nominations\nIn addition to winning three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series, Carlock has been nominated for the Emmys' individual writing award three times. He has won multiple Producers’ Guild and Writers’ Guild Awards as well as recognition from the American Film Institute. His work on 30 Rock also garnered Carlock a Peabody Award, a Television Critics Association Award, a GLAAD Award, a Gold Plaque from the Hugo Television Awards, a Golden Nymph from the Monaco Film and Television Festival, a Bravo A-List Award, some award that's shaped like a Calder stabile, a Comedy Central Comedy Award, and a Golden Globe.The following awards are categorized under the year they were announced (and not necessarily the year covered by the award ceremony).\nPassage 3:\nLive Show\n\"Live Show\" is the fourth episode of the fifth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock, and the 84th episode overall. It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and co-written by series creator Tina Fey and co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock. The episode originally aired live on the NBC television network in the United States on October 14, 2010, with separate versions for the East and West Coast television audiences. \"Live Show\" featured appearances by Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, Matt Damon, Jon Hamm, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n30 Rock follows the production of the fictional sketch comedy program The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). In this episode, on the night of a show, head writer Liz Lemon grows increasingly infuriated when no one seems to remember her 40th birthday. Just before TGS's live taping, Tracy Jordan decides to break character, to his co-workers' chagrin. Meanwhile, television executive Jack Donaghy struggles with the consequences of his promise to give up drinking while his girlfriend Avery Jessup is pregnant with their child.\n\"Live Show\" was an experiment for 30 Rock—filming with a multiple-camera setup before a studio audience to broadcast live—and the episode received positive reviews for its boldness as well as the nostalgia it showed for classic sitcom conventions and meta-humor—for instance, guest star Louis-Dreyfus portrays Liz Lemon in some cutaway scenes where it would be physically impossible for series regular Fed for a fourth and final season, with the first six episodes premiering on May 30, 2018. The second half was released on January 25, 2019. On May 8, 2019, it was announced that it would return with an interactive special, which premiered on May 12, 2020.\n\nCasting\nCasting announcements for the remaining roles were made in March 2014, with Tituss Burgess cast as Kimmy's roommate, Titus, and Carol Kane as Kimmy's and Titus's landlady, Lillian.Shortly afterwards, Sara Chase was cast Cyndee, Kimmy's closest friend during their years in the cult; and Lauren Adams as Gretchen, a 10-year member of the cult who believes everything she is told. Jane Krakowski was later cast as Jacqueline Voorhees, a wealthy Manhattanite who hires Kimmy as a nanny. Megan Dodds was originally cast before Krakowski replaced her.\n\nMusic\nThe show's theme song, \"Unbreakable\", was produced by The Gregory Brothers and written by Jeff Richmond. It is a tribute to The Gregory Brothers' YouTube show Songify the News – auto-tuned news interviews that became popular videos. It specifically parodies the mannerisms of Antoine Dodson in the \"Bed Intruder Song\". Richmond also wrote \"Peeno Noir\", a song performed by character Titus Andromedon during season 1, episode 6.\n\nArtwork\nArtwork for the show's opening sequence was produced by a team at Pentagram that included feminist artist Deva Pardue.\n\nHome video releases\nReception\nThe show has been widely acclaimed by television critics, who have praised the writing and cast.\n\nSeason 1\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a rating of 95%, based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Blessed with originality and a spot-on performance from Ellie Kemper, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is as odd as it is hilarious.\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".Scott Meslow of The Week called the series \"the first great sitcom of the streaming era\", praising its wit, edge, and feminist tone. Brian Moylan of The Guardian noted that it is \"the sort of show that could benefit from multiple viewings, because the jokes are so packed in you’re sure to miss something while laughing.\" TV Guide named it the \"best new comedy of 2015\". IGN reviewer Max Nicholson gave the first season an 8.3 out of 10 'Great' rating, saying \"Tina Fey and Robert Carlock's Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is another winner in Netflix's original series catalog. Not only is it charming and funny, but it's unabashedly kooky, and Ellie Kemper nails the lead role.\"The first season was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards.\nSome reviewers have criticized the show's portrayal of Native Americans, with Vulture referring to a prominent Native American subplot as \"offensive\". BuzzFeed wrote that the show has a \"major race problem\" and cited the lack of a plurality of portrayals of Native Americans as the main issue with the subplot, stating that \"the way Native Americans are represented on this show matters. It's not one representation among a cornucopia of representations; it's the single mainstream representation in years.\" The Daily Beast stated that when it comes to race, “especially in its portrayal of a key Vietnamese character, the show leaves much to be desired.”In the wake of the controversy, Tina Fey responded: \"I feel like we put so much effort into writing and crafting everything, they need to speak for themselves. There's a real culture of demanding apologies, and I'm opting out of that.\"\n\nSeason 2\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 100% approval rating, based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Not letting up in season two, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is still odd in the best of ways, wonderfully building on its unique comedy stylings and brilliantly funny cast.\" On Metacritic, the second season has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".The second season was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards.\nThere was controversy surrounding the third episode from this season, “Kimmy Goes to a Play!,” which involved the use of yellow-face and the name of a group of Asian-Americans who were critical of yellow-face. The group is referred to as \"Respectful Asian Portrayals in Entertainment\", or \"R.A.P.E\" for short. The Asian-Americans shown protesting against yellow-face in the episode are conveyed as unlikable buffoons. Anna Akana criticized the use of yellow-face and the R.A.P.E. acronym during her 2016 Asians in Entertainment Key Note speech. Alex Abad-Santos wrote, “The odd thing about this episode is that it's another Tina Fey project that paints Asian people, specifically Asian women, as crappy characters. [...] The plot feels like a pointed, ironic response to anyone who has criticized Fey's past projects for being lazy and racist.”\n\nSeason 3\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the third season holds a 97% approval rating, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.11/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt continues to thrive with a comically agile cast, notable guest stars, and a forceful influx of funny.\" On Metacritic, the third season has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".The third season was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nSeason 4\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season holds a 94% approval rating, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.77/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ends with a final season that's as topical as it is cheerily irreverent.\" On Metacritic, the fourth season has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".The fourth season was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nSpecial\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend special has an approval rating of 94%, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.81/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Kimmy and company return as resilient as ever in a fun and fast paced special that makes excellent use of its interactive capabilities to produce maximum fabulosity.\"The special was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The (usually quadrilateral) marked surface on which one plays a board game. The namesake of the board game, gameboards would seem to be a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre, though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards (as well as games that use neither cards nor a gameboard) are often colloquially included. Most games use a standardized and unchanging board (chess, Gonoughts and crosses and Go are respectively the simplest and most complex examples) or placing and moving pieces on a board (nine men's morris).\nMancala games involve players distributing seeds across a series of holes and collecting the contents of holes that achieve specific numeric or numeric/positional status. Typically one wins by collecting the most seeds, or rendering the opponent unable to move.Bell used the basic categories suggested by Murray with some alterations.  Because his treatment extended beyond board games, Bell also included the categories of dice and domino games; and in his second volume added \"Games of Words and Numbers\", \"Card Games Requiring Boards\", and \"Games of manual dexterity\". In addition, there is mention of the subgenre of solitaire and puzzle games.\nBell drew on a wide range of sources, including Edward Falkener, Stewart Culin, Willard Fiske, H. J. R. Murray, John Scarne, and many others; as well as his own research and collection.\n\nPublications\nBooks about board and table games\nRobert Charles Bell MB, FRCS (R. C.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAvoca Beach, New South Wales\nAvoca Beach is a coastal suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, about 95 kilometres (59 mi) north of Sydney. Avoca Beach is primarily a residential suburb, Avoca Beach is also a popular tourist destination. Avoca Beach is known for its surfing and state (regional) surf competitions. Avoca Beach village has a variety of restaurants and cafes as well as a post office, newsagent, pharmacy and mini-mart. Avoca Beach also has a historic cinema, a hotel, bowling club, motel and caravan park. It is located within the Central Coast Council local government area.\nThis suburb is unrelated to the NSW Southern Highlands suburb of Avoca, New South Wales, except in name only.\n\nGeography\nAvoca Beach is located on the Tasman Sea 17 kilometres (11 mi) east-southeast of the Gosford central business district, and about halfway between Newcastle and Sydney, being about 95 kilometres (59 mi) from each. It is bordered to the north by the Bulbararing Lagoon, to the west by Saltwater Creek and to the east by the ocean.\n\nHistory\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Darkinjung & Awabakal Aboriginal people. \"Avoca\" is an Irish name meaning \"great estuary\" or \"where the river meets the sea\", and is also the name of a town in County Wicklow, Ireland.On 4 January 1830, 640 acres (259 ha) of land in the area were promised to Irish army officer John Moore. However, the official deeds were not issued until 30 September 1839, due to the difficulty in surveying the land. He built a house opposite Bulbararing Lake (now known as Avoca Lake) and planted vines, cereals and fruit trees. He left the area in 1857 for the Victorian goldfields. In the late 19th century, Tom Davis leased the area in order to exploit local timber, which was transported by tram to a mill at Terrigal via what is now Tramway Road in North Avoca.\n\nIn the 1950s, commercial buildings began to be built and populated, including bakery, service station, butchery, mini mart, caravan park and the Avoca Beach Picture Theatre.\nResidential development in Avoca Beach began during the 20th century, and the area subsequently became a popular holiday retreat with wealthy residents of Sydney's North Shore.In February 2010, following the proposal to scuttle the frigate HMAS Adelaide off the beach as a dive wreck in late March, a resident action group was formed to protest against this. The group claims that the wreck will negatively affect surf conditions, tides, and littoral sand drift, and is concerned over the thoroughness of inspection and removal of dangerous materials and chemicals from the former warship, with the chance that marine life and people could be poisoned. An appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal three days before the planned scuttling date of 27 March led to a postponement of the plan until the residents' claims were investigated. The decision from the Tribunal, in favor of the project going ahead after further cleanup work, was handed down on 15 September 2010, and despite further attempts to delay, Adelaide was scuttled on 13 April 2011.\n\nDemographics\nAt the ABS 2016 census, Avoca Beach had a population of 4,584 people. 76.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 8.9%. 90.9% of people only spoke English at home.

Robinsons Department Store was closed then Bargain Exchange was replaced and several stores pulled out and it opened an opportunity for micro-retails. In 2010, Robinsons Movieworld Novaliches closed Cinemas 5 to 8 being rented by some Christian Churches inside the mall. Examples of some Christian churches that rented Cinemas 5-8 are Word of Hope Christian Church which occupies Cinemas 5 and 6 and Victory Christian Church which occupies Cinema 7. In 2012, Cinemas 1 to 4 has permanently closed and it is open for rentals for some Christian Churches and for others.\nThe mall had undergone major renovation and expansion against Ayala Malls' Fairview Terraces and SM Prime Holdings' SM City Fairview. The said expansion houses over 200 micro-retail shops and bargain stores selling apparel, shoes and bags, novelty and gift items and gadgets; food court, Trade Hall, and al fresco dining restaurants. It was opened on May 29, 2015. It added another 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) to the 45,893 m2 (493,990 sq ft) square meters so it will have a total floor area of 55,893 m2 (601,630 sq ft) square meters. And eventually after the expansion, it was renamed as Robinsons Novaliches. \nMoreover, Robinsons Digiworld was opened at the Level 2 of the Main Mall which occupies the old location of some bargain things and a passport office of the Department of Foreign Affairs called DFA CO NCR-North was also opened at the Level 3 near the former Robinsons Movieworld Novaliches in November 2016.\n\nSee also\nFairview Terraces\nSM City Fairview\nRobinsons Magnolia\nList of shopping malls in Metro Manila\nPassage 3:\nRobinsons Place Las Piñas\nRobinsons Las Piñas (formerly Robinsons Place Las Piñas) is a shopping mall and mixed-use development in Las Piñas, Philippines. It is located on the north side of Alabang–Zapote Road between CAA Road and Admiral Road in Talon Tres.

It is the 39th mall opened by Robinsons in the Philippines and the first and only Robinsons mall in Las Piñas and the whole South Manila area.\n\nDescription\nRobinsons Las Piñas sits on a 6.8-hectare (17-acre) lot on the busy Alabang-Zapote Road in close proximity to several heavily populated and middle-class subdivisions in the south Manila area of Las Piñas and Parañaque such as BF Homes, CAA-BF International, Casimiro Village and BF Resort Village. It has a gross floor area of 59,877 square metres (644,510 sq ft) with a gross leasable area of 25,734 square metres (277,000 sq ft). The two-storey shopping center is anchored by Robinsons staples like Robinsons Department Store, Robinsons Supermarket, Robinsons Appliances and Robinsons MovieWorld. The mall is also part of a mixed-use development that will also consist of a mid-rise residential complex of Robinsons Communities.\nPassage 4:\nRobinsons Galleria Cebu\nRobinsons Galleria Cebu, also known and branded as Galleria Cebu, is a shopping mall and mixed-use development located in North Reclamation Area, Cebu City. It is the 2nd Robinsons Mall to bear the Galleria branding after Robinsons Galleria. The mall opened on December 10, 2015. The mall is just a few meters from the Port of Cebu and approximately 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) away from SM City Cebu. The mall is owned and operated by Robinsons Malls. It is the firm's third largest mall (after Robinsons Place Manila and its namesake, Robinsons Galleria, in Ortigas, Metro Manila).\n\nHistory\nIn 2008, Robinsons Land, Inc. announced that they have bought a 4-hectare (9.9-acre) prime property near the Port of Cebu. The company bared that they planned to build a mall, a three-storey BPO tower, a 153-room Go Hotel (which would have been the first in Cebu), 9,000 m2 (97,000 sq ft) of office space and a couple of high-rise condominiums. The development was initially called Robinsons Maxilom,confectionaries.\n\nBuilding C\nBuilding C is a recent addition to SM Megamall that houses office space on the upper levels of the carpark and a transport terminal, which includes an integrated bus terminal serving the north of Metro Manila including CAMANAVA, Quezon City and further to Bulacan and Calabarzon.

The Mega Fashion Hall also houses an IMAX Digital theater (which is also the eighth IMAX cinema in the country), a 56-seat Director's Club Cinema with butler service, an Olympic-sized ice skating rink (replacing the one removed in 2009 from the lower-ground level of Building A), an upscale food court (Mega Food Hall), and a 14-lane bowling center, the SM Bowling Center (also replacing the one removed in 2009 from the lower-ground level of Building A, now Toy Kingdom) . The fashion hall also features the BTS Pop-Up Store, located at the mall's third floor, and showcases over 400 BTS-branded products.\n\nTime Sculpture\nThe Time Sculpture is a sculpture located fronting the Mega Fashion Hall. The sculpture was unveiled on August 2, 2021, and is designed by Filipino-American public artist Jefre Manuel Figueras, also known as JEFRË, and was made of stainless steel. The sculpture is part of the Baks \"Box\" Series, where he gives representation to people living in cities around the world, and resembles a man looking at his watch, which serves as reminder how time is important in our lives and to make use of time in traffic productively. JEFRË also converted the statue's head to a block, which connects the figures to surrounding urban architecture, and strengthens the image that people are a city's major component as the building blocks and the bloodline of the city.\n\nExpansion\nAfter the soft opening of the newly constructed Building C Carpark, the mall surpassed SM Mall of Asia by 2,000 m2 (22,000 sq ft) and became the second largest shopping mall in the country.\nWith the opening of the Mega Fashion Hall (Building D), the current gross leasable area is 500,000 m2 (5,400,000 sq ft), allowing the mall to reclaim the title of the largest mall in the Philippines.The addition of the Mega Fashion Hall building added 125 new retail stores, 90% of which are global brands and 10% of which are local retailers.\n\nMega Tower\nA 50-storey 249.7 m (819 ft) office tower, named The Mega Tower, is built next to the Mega Fashion Hall formerly occupied by an open carpark.

Sigler  (born 1945) is an American lawyer, gun rights activist, former chair of the Republican State Committee of Delaware and former president of the National Rifle Association (NRA).\nSigler graduated from Milford High School in 1964 and attended Appalachian State Teacher's College. He earned a bachelors degree in criminal justice administration from Wilmington College in 1981, a Master of Business Administration from Central Michigan University, and a Juris Doctor from Widener University School of Law in 1987. He served in the United States Navy from 1967 to 1971 on the USS George Bancroft (SSBN-643) and USS Hardhead (SS-365), and worked for the police department in Dover, Delaware from 1972 to 1991. He retired as a captain and subsequently worked as a lawyer.\nSigler joined the NRA in 1970 and was elected to the board of directors in 1996. He was named president at the 2007 annual meeting in St. Louis, succeeding Sandra Froman to become the 59th president of the organization. He served two terms and was succeeded by Ron Schmeits in 2009.\nIn 2013, Sigler abruptly resigned as chair of the Delaware Republican Party.\nPassage 2:\nJubilee doctor\nA jubilee doctor (Swedish: jubeldoktor, Finnish: riemutohtori, Latin: doctor jubilaris) or golden doctor (German: Goldene Doktor) is in some countries a person who has held a doctorate for 50 years or more. When 50 years have passed, the doctor is invited again by his or her university to the ceremony where the doctorates are conferred and is made jubilee/golden doctor and celebrated as a guest of honour. This custom is common in Germany, Sweden and Finland. In Germany, this ceremony is referred to as the \"Golden Promotion\" (Goldene Promotion). In Sweden, a person so honoured who holds, for instance, a doctorate of philosophy, may use the academic title fil.jubeldr instead of the regular fil.dr.\nPassage 3:\nDoctorate\nA doctorate (from Latin docere, \"to teach\"), doctor's degree (from Latin doctor, \"teacher\"), or doctoral degree is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities and some other educational institutions, derived from the ancient formalism licentia docendi (\"licence to teach\"). In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also professional degrees that include \"doctor\" in their name and are classified as doctorates. \nMany universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or  other contributions to the university or society.\n\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nThe term doctor derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\". The doctorate (Latin: doctoratus) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach Latin (licentia docendi) at a university. Its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the Apostles, church fathers, and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.The right to grant a licentia docendi (i.e. the doctorate) was originally reserved to the Catholic Church, which required the applicant to pass a test, take an oath of allegiance, and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed access—at that time essentially free of charge—to all able applicants. Applicants were tested for aptitude. This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities, slowly distancing themselves from the Church. In 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the University of Paris, where it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubique docendi). However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (baccalaureus), the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master's degree (magister) and doctorate, both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications. According to Keith Allan Noble (1994), the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval Paris around 1150 by the University of Paris.George Makdisi theorizes that the ijazah issued in early Islamic madrasahs was the origin of the doctorate later issued in medieval European universities. Alfred Guillaume and Syed Farid al-Attas agree that there is a resemblance between the ijazah and the licentia docendi. However, Toby Huff and others reject Makdisi's theory. Devin J. Stewart notes a difference in the granting authority (individual professor for the ijzazah and a corporate entity in the case of the university doctorate).\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nThe doctorate of philosophy developed in Germany in the 17th century (likely c. 1652). The term \"philosophy\" does not refer solely to the field or academic discipline of philosophy. Still, it is used in a broader sense under its original Greek meaning: \"love of wisdom\". In most of Europe, all fields (history, philosophy, social sciences, mathematics, and natural philosophy/natural sciences) were traditionally known as philosophy, and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the \"faculty of philosophy\". The Doctorate of Philosophy adheres to this historic convention, even though most degrees are not for the study of philosophy. Chris Park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the Doctorate of Philosophy was reintroduced in Germany as a research degree, abbreviated as Dr. phil. (similar to Ph.D. in Anglo-American countries). Germany, however, differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. nat. and also doctorates in the social/political sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. pol., similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine (Dr. med.) and law (Dr. jur.).\nUniversity doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of \"Masters of Arts\" was seven years, matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations. Originally the terms \"master\" and \"doctor\" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master's degree.\nUniversity degrees, including doctorates, were originally restricted to men. The first women to be granted doctorates were Juliana Morell in 1608 at Lyons or maybe Avignon (she \"defended theses\" in 1606 or 1607, although claims that she received a doctorate in canon law in 1608 have been discredited), Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678 at the University ofcomputer scientist, she moved her family to Phoenix, Arizona in 1970.\nOnce Pizzarello's youngest of four children finished primary school, her focus returned to her career after a decade away from scientific research. She audited a graduate biochemistry seminar course at ASU where she met Professor John Cronin, future co-discoverer of amino acid enantiomeric excess in meteorites. Due to her outstanding performance in the course, she was offered a job to work with Cronin at the university as a research professor in analyzing the recently recovered Murchison meteorite.\nSandra Pizzarello died on October 24, 2021.\n\nResearch\nSandra Pizzarello's research over the last forty years involved the analysis of organic compounds in several carbonaceous chondrites, particularly molecular, chiral, and isotopic characterization of amino acids. Because the formation of these organic-rich meteorites pre-date the origin of life, they had been under investigation as potential sites of primal organic compounds which could shed light on abiogenesis, specifically the origin of biological homochirality. Such studies, however, had been inconclusive until 1997 when Cronin and Pizzarello detected 7-9% L-enantiomeric excesses of three abiological amino acids while analyzing the Murchison meteorite.Given Earth's history of meteoric impacts and the observation that meteors contain an excess of the biologically relevant L-stereoisomer of certain amino acids, Pizzarello studied the effect of meteoritic amino acids in enantiomeric excess on the formation of other biological molecules. In one study, Pizzarello found that nonracemic solutions of abiological isovaline and proteinogenic alanine can direct the condensation of  glycolaldehyde to produce nonracemic solutions of threose and erythrose via an aldol reaction concluding that amino acids can act as asymmetric catalysts in carbohydrate synthesis. These findings support the origin of life hypothesis that homochirality originated prior to life and from extraterrestrial origins. However, Pizzarello's theoretical inquiries into cosmochemical evolution remain debated based on suspect analytical evidence of meteoritic enantiomeric excesses.\n\nExternal links\n# https://nai.nasa.gov/directory/pizzarello-sandra/ NASA.gov\nhttps://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/274781\nPassage 5:\nSandra Eades\nSandra Eades  (born 1967) is a Noongar physician, researcher and professor, and the first Aboriginal medical practitioner to be awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy in 2003. As of March 2020 she is Dean of Medicine at Curtin University.\n\nEarly life and education\nSandra Eades was born in Mount Barker, Western Australia and at the age of 12 moved to Perth with her family. In primary school she wanted to be a doctor but thought she would not have that opportunity as an Aboriginal girl.

Shepard\nHerbert Allen Shepard (1919–1985) was a Canadian-born American organization behaviorist and economist who made a significant contribution to Organization Development He held faculty posts at several universities including M.I.T., where he received his doctorate in Industrial Economics. He founded and directed the first doctoral program in Organization Development at Case Western Reserve; developed a residency in administrative psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, and was also President of The Gestalt Institute of Cleveland and The Professional Development Institute.\nShepard conducted the first large-scale experiments in Organization Development, while at Esso in the late fifties, and served as principal consultant to TRW Systems in the applications of behavioral science to organizations and teams. He has published widely and was chairman of the Douglas Memorial Award Committee of the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science. His research advanced our understanding of human behavior and social systems from dyads (doctor-patient or consultant-client) to organizations (synergy, alternative dispute resolution, structure, building consensus and caring about the powerless). It opened the way for further developments in the psychology of teams, leadership and  interpersonal compatibility; cognitive behavior therapy, social cognitive theory (educational psychology); choice theory;\"Principled Negotiation\". 26 September 2022., positive psychology and organization development.\nIn management consulting, Shepard's clients included Bell-Northern Research, Syncrude, Esso, TRW, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, Union Carbide, USAID and most of the departments of the federal governments of the U.S.A. and Canada.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nQionghai\nQionghai, or in local Hainanese dialect as Kheng Hai, is one of the seven county-level cities of Hainan province, China. Although called a \"city\", Qionghai refers to a large land area in Hainan - an area which was once a county. Within this area is the main city, Qionghai City. It is located in the east of the island at the mouth of the Wanquan River, 86 kilometres (53 mi) from the provincial capital of Haikou. It has an area of 1,692 square kilometres (653 sq mi) and in 2010, it had a population of 483,217 people.\nThe seat of government is at Jiaji (simplified Chinese: 嘉积镇; traditional Chinese: 嘉積鎮; pinyin: Jiājī Zhèn), locally referred to as Kachek city.

In 2002, it had a population of 520,000 residing in an area of 703 km2 (271 sq mi).\n\nTourist attractions\nDaying is the home of the \"Chinese Dead Sea\", a tourist attraction that is based on a salt lake with nine times the salinity of the ocean and which constitutes the largest indoor water park in China.\nA stationary replica of the Titanic is under construction in Daying County as well.\n\nTransportation\nThe G42 Shanghai–Chengdu Expressway and Dazhou–Chengdu Railway (达成铁路) traverses east–west through the entire length of the county.\nThe county is served by the Daying East Station (大英东站) on the Suining–Chengdu Railway.\nPassage 3:\nSuining\nSuining (simplified Chinese: 遂宁; traditional Chinese: 遂寧; Sichuanese Pinyin: Xu4nin2; Sichuanese pronunciation: [ɕy˨˦nin˨˩]; pinyin: Sùiníng; Wade–Giles: Sui-ning) is a prefecture-level city of eastern Sichuan province in Southwest China. In 2002, Suining had a population of 658,798.\n\nGeography and climate\nSuining is located in the center of the Sichuan Basin and on the central reaches of the Fu River, bordering Chongqing, Guang'an and Nanchong to the east, Neijiang and Ziyang to the south, the provincial capital of Chengdu to the west, and Deyang and Mianyang to the north. Its prefecture, or administrative, area ranges in latitude from 30° 10' 50\" to 31° 10' 50\" N, or 108.9 kilometres (67.7 mi) and in longitude from 105° 03' 26\" to 106° 59' 49\" E, or 90.3 kilometres (56.1 mi). While much of the prefecture is mountainous, the urban area itself, which occupies 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi), is located on flat land.\nSuining has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) and is largely mild and humid, with four distinct seasons. Winter is short, mild, and foggy, though actual precipitation is low. January averages 6.6 °C (43.9 °F), and while frost may occur, snow is rare.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nYameen\nYameen is an American hip hop producer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. His most recent album, \"Diamond is Unfadable\" was released in 2017 on Rumble Pack Records.\n\nLight of Love / Sound of Fire\nIn 2010, Yameen released an anime music video for his single, “Light of Love” featuring singer, Lady Alma. The video was a production of Daisuke Nakayama's Realthing studio located in Shibuya, Tokyo and directed by Jamie Vickers (Studio 4°C, Madhouse).“Light of Love” was a vertical slice of an intended full-featured television pilot called “The Sound of Fire,” consisting of characters such as the titular Yameen, Meca, Ichi-go and more featured in the video.\nThe video ends with the cast of characters sitting atop the iconic Hieroglyphics music group 3-eyed logo, a clear nod to Yameen's history as \"StinkE\" with the group.\n\nSupremeEx\nThe recording alias \"SupremeEx\" is generally reserved for collaborative concept albums between Yameen and Tajai of Souls of Mischief / Hieroglyphics.In 1998, SupremeEx released the instrumental-only affair, Destructor on retail cassette which originally caught the ear of Tajai and also lead to collaborations with Bobbito's Footworks, Electronic Arts / EA Sports and Eckō Unltd. clothing, among others. SupremeEx & Tajai began recording what would become their first project together, Projecto: 2501 that same year.In 1999, SupremeEx and Tajai released Projecto: 2501 as the first album on Tajai's fledgling Hieroglyphics Imperium sub-imprint, Clear Label Records. The critically acclaimed EP - applauded for its imaginative use of story telling elements such as included trading cards, Enhanced CD and web-delivered content - featured guest artists Shing02, Low Budget (Hollertronix), Jay Biz (Hieroglyphics), DJ Nozawa & Major Terror. Additional content was also included on the Enhanced CD including a bonus MP3, computer wallpaper, videos in the studio recording \"Projecto\" and more.In 2005, Rumble Pack Records released an all-new full-length album from SupremeEx & Tajai entitled, Nuntype. Again, building on the story-telling aspects the duo established on, \"Projecto\" Nuntype is an album about Chaos, Prophecy and Change with Tajai as a deity who wields the power of Creation. Guest artist included R&B crooner, Goapele on the album's single, \"Meaning\".Although never established as an official labelmate, nor indicative of the classic \"Hiero sound\", Yameen's roots as Stinke — the creator and curator of Hieroglyphics.com between 1995 and 2001 — offer him a curious niche in helping broaden the Hiero discography.\n\nStinkE (Web Developer)\nYameen, under his nom de web \"StinkE,\" designed and coded many popular hiphop websites and was featured as one of URB magazine's \"Next 100\" people to watch in April 2001. His work with the music group Hieroglpyhics proved particularly ground-breaking.In 1995 when the individual group members of Hieroglyphics were each released from their respective major record labels, Yameen's fansite caught the attention of Souls of Mischief member Tajai who made the website the official online destination of Hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics.com was one of the first websites from any music artist and was featured heavily in popular media of the time. Yameen as the site's webmaster engaged directly with the group's fanbase, fostering a vibrant and active online community at a time when most people did not have access to personal computers or the internet. This community-driven aspect is what allowed the Hieroglyphics to continue to flourish as independent artists without the need of a major label.In 2013, Oakland, California mayor Jean Quan recognized the efforts of Yameen and Hieroglyphics.com as \"a pioneering entity in technology and innovation and shining example of a local, homegrown business with worldwide appeal and recognition\" while officially establishing September 3 as \"Hiero Day\" in the city of Oakland, CA.Yameen also coded websites for artists such as Aesop Rock, The Giant Peach, Murs, Mr. Len & more.\n\nDiscography\nSolo albums\nNever Knows Best (2008)\nNever Knows More (2009)\nNever Knows Encore (2010)\nCome On & Go Off (2014)\n\nSupremeEx albums\nDestructor (1998)\nProjecto: 2501 (2000)\nNuntype (2005)\nNuntype: The Instrumentals (2006)\n\nOther appearances\nMarch Madness 2000 (Videogame) (1999)\nSome of the Coolest Rappers...Ecko Clothing Compilation (2000)\nSleeping Giant, mixtape by Tajai (2003)\nPre-emptive Hype 3.5 HipHopSite\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Artist Website\nYameen Discogs\nSupremeEx Artist Website\nNuntype Website\nProjecto: 2501 Website\nHieroglyphics Website\nSupremeEx Discogs\nInterview\nPassage 2:\nRight Back at It Again\n\"Right Back at It Again\" is the second track and the first single from A Day to Remember's fifth album, Common Courtesy (2013). In October 20, 2015, the song was featured in Activision rhythm-music game, Guitar Hero Live.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nVocalist, Jeremy McKinnon wrote the lyrics, while the music was written by McKinnon, former guitarist Tom Denney, guitarist Neil Westfall and producer Andrew Wade. \"Right Back at It Again\" almost wasn't included on the album as it was one of the excess songs the band had recorded, \"we realised that it sounded great, so on it went.\"\n\nRelease and reception\n\"Right Back at It Again\" was announced on October 7, 2013 to be broadcast as part of BBC Radio 1's Rock Show the following midnight, with the band calling the song their \"brand new single\". The song impacted radio on November 11. \"Right Back at It Again\" charted at number 33 on the Alternative Songs chart, and at number 40 on the Modern Rock chart in the U.S. McKinnon, Westfall and guitarist Kevin Skaff performed a surprise acoustic show for Warped Tour 2013 UK on November 17, and another acoustic set, this time at Banquet Records the following day, both in London; band played \"Right Back at It Again\" on both occasions.Tamsyn Wilce for Alter the Press! noted that the way \"Right Back at it Again\" follows on from openingusing real Intellivision controllers Intellivision Productions supported the use of a device called the Intellicart.  The Intellicart is a RAM cartridge with an RS-232 interface that can accept a copy of an Intellivision ROM image file from a computer.  Rather than play the Intellivision Lives! games through an emulator, they can be played on a real Intellivision through an Intellicart.  Since that time modern Intellivision flash memory cartridges have been made that achieve the same result.\nIn 2002 an updated Intellivision Lives! PC/Mac v1.1 was made available by Intellivision Productions.  Those that purchased the original could upgrade for a nominal fee.  It added Windows 98/ME/2000/XP support with a native Windows emulator supporting DirectX sound, video, and game controllers.\n\nModern video game consoles\nRealtime Associates developed the video game console editions published by Crave Entertainment for PlayStation 2 (2003), Xbox (2004), and GameCube (2004).  In these versions the games are accessed from a 3D \"overworld\" set in a circa 1980s pizza parlor; an inaccurate representation as the Intellivision games were originally designed for a home console. Games were also re-organised by genres rather than the original Mattel Electronics Networks used in the PC/Mac edition.  Some games require two controllers, even to play single player.In 2010 Virtual Play Games published Intellivision Lives! for the Nintendo DS handheld system, also developed by Realtime Associates. It features wireless, multiplayer support using a single game card. The Nintendo DS's touch screen emulates the Intellivision's 12-button keypad including an overlay image for each game.  The Nintendo DS lacks a 16 direction pad used by some Intellivision games.  This limitation was overcome, in Vectron for example, by mapping directional inputs to the touch screen.  Only 10,000 copies of the Nintendo DS edition were ever released.The Xbox version of Intellivision Lives! is fully forward compatible with the Xbox 360 console, and in 2008 Intellivision Lives! became available for purchase as a download through Xbox Live Game Marketplace's Xbox Originals.\n\nIntellivision Rocks\nIntellivision Rocks is the PC-only sequel to the original PC version of Intellivision Lives!. As with Intellivision Lives!, Intellivision Rocks is a collection of games which were originally found on the Intellivision, presented in emulated form. It mainly features 3rd-party games from Activision and Imagic. In addition, several unreleased games are included.\n\nReception\nIGN said that Intellivision Lives! is \"still blocky after all these years, sure...but these games really need the controller.\" GameSpot editors said that although the controller emulation is a little hard to handle, the collection does a fine job in delivering classic Intellivision games.\nPassage 8:\nRaven Software\nRaven Software Corporation is an American video game developer based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic games, left to form Human Head Studios.\n\nHistory\nid Software\nRaven Software was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel. Originally a three-person company, they were discovered by John Romero, co-founder of id Software, who collaborated with Raven to make games using their game engine beginning with ShadowCaster. Raven then started making games with id Software; the company even briefly moved to the same street as id Software. They used id's engines for many of their games, such as Heretic, Hexen: Beyond Heretic and Hexen II.\nIn 2005 and 2009, Raven developed two games from id's catalog: Quake 4 and Wolfenstein respectively.\n\nActivision\nThe company was independent until 1997, when it was acquired by Activision for $12 million. They were still collaborating with id Software but at the same time developed other titles as well such as Soldier of Fortune in 2000, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy in 2003, X-Men Legends in 2004 and many more.\nIn August 2009, following poor performance and possible over-budget of Wolfenstein, the company made a major layoff of 30-35 staff, leaving two development teams. This was reduced to one after more layoffs in October 2010, after delays with Singularity; as many as 40 staff were released. Following the layoffs and after id Software was bought over by ZeniMax Media, Raven has since become a primary developer for the Call of Duty series.In December 2021, Activision did not renew the contract of several members of the quality assurance (QA) department that were contract employees.  One of the associate managers said that \"valuable members\" were fired although they \"were promised, for months, that Activision was working towards a pay restructure to increase their wages\". Following these firings as well as other controversies revolving Activision Blizzard, a strike has been initiated. On January 21, 2022, Raven's QA team formed a union named the Game Workers Alliance with Communications Workers of America.In May 2022, a group of quality assurance testers from Raven Software successfully organized a union known as the Game Workers Alliance, with the vote being 19 for and 3 against. In June 2022 Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick stated that the company would recognize the union and begin negotiations with it.\n\nGames\nIn 2012, Raven began hiring employees for a game, and were announced as collaborating with Infinity Ward on Call of Duty: Ghosts in May 2013.On April 3, 2013 following the closure of LucasArts, Raven Software released the source code for Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy on SourceForge under the GPL-2.0-only license.In April 2014, the company became lead developer of the now shutdown free-to-play Chinese Call of Duty title, Call of Duty: Online. The company also remade Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, titled Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.In 2020, Raven Software collaborated with Infinity Ward on the game Call of Duty: Warzone. The company is considered the face of maintaining, updating and debugging the game as they regularly provide status updates and patch notes on Twitter and their official website (though it is unclear if they are the sole studio responsible behind-the-scenes).Raven developed Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War with Treyarch, which released on November 13, 2020.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nFrank Lloyd\nFrank William George Lloyd (2 February 1886 – 10 August 1960) was a British-born American film director, actor, scriptwriter, and producer. He was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and was its president from 1934 to 1935.\nHe is Scotland's first Academy Award winner and is unique in film history, having received three Oscar nominations in 1929 for his work on a silent film (The Divine Lady), a part-talkie (Weary River) and a full talkie (Drag). He won for The Divine Lady. He was nominated and won again in 1933 for his adaptation of Noël Coward's Cavalcade and received a further Best Director nomination in 1935 for perhaps his most successful film, Mutiny on the Bounty. Lloyd is credited with being a founder of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.\nIn 1957, he was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.On 8 February 1960, Lloyd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry, at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nEarly life and career\nLloyd was born in Cambuslang, on the outskirts of Glasgow, the youngest of seven children. His mother Jane was Scottish and his father Edmund was Welsh, a mechanical engineer. The family travelled the country until his father was injured and gave up engineering. They settled in Shepherd's Bush, London, where the family ran a pub. Lloyd worked in a shoe shop, sang in choral groups and joined a vaudeville group.\nIn 1909 he emigrated to Canada where he worked on a ranch in Alberta for a year. He also erected poles and writes for a telephone company, then joined a travelling show as an actor and singer. The show wound up in Los Angeles in 1913 and Lloyd decided to stay there and act in Hollywood films.\n\nFilm director\nParamount\nHe began directing shorts for Paramount and moved to longer running films: The Gentleman from Indiana (1915), Jane (1915), The Reform Candidate (1916), The Tongues of Men (1916), The Call of the Cumberlands (1916), Madame la Presidente (1916) with Anna Held, The Code of Marcia Gray (1916), David Garrick (1916 film) (1916), The Making of Maddalena (1916), An International Marriage (1916), and The Stronger Love (1916). The Intrigue (1916) was produced through Pallas Films and released through Paramount.  Lloyd's biographer argued his early films \"are not 'masterpieces,' but they are on a par with films from other secondary directors of the period. In other words, they are not comparable to those directed by D.W. Griffith, but are as good as those directed by Allan Dwan.\"\n\nFox\nLloyd directed Sins of Her Parent (1916) at Fox, and The World and the Woman (1916) with Jeanne Eagles for Tranhouser. Back at Fox he did The Kingdom of Love (1917), and a series of films starring William Farnum\" The Price of Silence (1917), A Tale of Two Cities (1917) from the novel by Charles Dickens, American Methods (1917), When a Man Sees Red (1917), Les Misérables (1917), The Heart of a Lion (1917), True Blue (1918), Riders of the Purple Sage (1918) from the novel by Zane Grey and its sequel The Rainbow Trail (1918), For Freedom (1918), and The Man Hunter (1919). Without Farnum, Lloyd directed The Blindness of Divorce (1918).\n\nGoldwyn\nAt Goldwyn he made Pitfalls of a Big City (1919),The World and Its Woman (1919), The Loves of Letty (1919), The Woman in Room 13 (1920), The Silver Horde (1920 film) (1920), Madame X  (1920) with Pauline Frederick, The Great Lover (1920), A Tale of Two Worlds (1921), Roads of Destiny (1921) with Frederick, A Voice in the Dark (1921), The Invisible Power (1921), The Grim Comedian (1921), and The Man from Lost River (1921) plus The Sin Flood (1922) with Richard Dix.\n\nFirst National\nLloyd directed some films for First National with Norma Talmadge: The Eternal Flame (1921), The Voice from the Minaret (1922), Within the Law (1923) and Ashes of Vengeance (1923).\nAlso for that studio was Oliver Twist (1922) with Lon Chaney and Jackie Coogan, and Black Oxen (1924).\nHe had his own company at First National, Frank Lloyd Productions. They made The Sea Hawk (1924), a swashbuckler with Milton Sills, then The Silent Watcher (1924), Her Husband's Secret (1925), Winds of Chance (1925), The Splendid Road (1926), and The Wise Guy (1926).\n\nParamount\nAt Paramount Lloyd made The Eagle of the Sea (1926), Children of Divorce (1927 film) (1927), Adoration (1928) with Billie Dove, The Divine Lady (1929) with Corinne Griffith, and Dark Streets (1929). Lloyd won the Academy Award for Best director for The Divine Lady.\nThere were several films starring Richard Barthemless: Weary River (1929), Drag (1929), Young Nowheres (1930), Son of the Gods (1930), and The Lash (1930). He was Oscar nominated for Best Director for Drag and Weary River.\nThere was also The Way of All Men (1930), a remake of Lloyds' own The Sin Flood, The Right of Way (1931), and East Lynne (1931).For Howard Hughes, Lloyd did The Age for Love (1931). Back at Fox he made A Passport to Hell (1932) then Cavalcade (1933), which won Lloyd the Oscar for Best Director.\nLloyd then made what was his favourite film, Berkeley Square (1933), starring Leslie Howard, followed by Hoop-La (1933) the final film of Clara Bow and Servants' Entrance (1934) with Janet Gaynor.\n\nMutiny on the Bounty and later career\nLloyd had a huge hit with Mutiny on the BountBerger to build the house on his own on Redwood Road in San Anselmo, California. It took 20 years to finish the US$15,000 house.In 1956, Robert's 12-year-old son Jim Berger became concerned about his black Labrador Retriever Eddie staying outside in the winter, and decided he needed a doghouse to stay warm. Jim subsequently wrote a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright stating, \"I would appreciate it if you would design me a doghouse which would be easy to build but would go with our house.\" Jim continued to explain Eddie's dimensions (\"two and a half feet high and three feet long\"), his dog's age (\"four years old or in dog life 28 years\"), and his ability to pay for the plans and materials of the doghouse with earned money from delivering newspapers along a bicycle paper route he had. Wright responded to the letter with a typed and signed note on Taliesin West stationery. The note stated that \"A house for Eddie is an opportunity...but just now I am too busy to concentrate on it.\" Wright implored the boy to write again a year later to see if he was a little less busy.Jim followed the suggestion laid out by Wright and a year later wrote again asking for a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed doghouse. Not long after sending out this second letter a full set of working drawings arrived in the mail for a four square foot triangular doghouse designed by Wright himself. The doghouse was to be built of scrap Philippine mahogany and cedar left over from the construction of the human-sized house it was to be situated next to. Looking back at the situation a 68-year-old Jim Berger stated:\nMy dog had a lot of class, and a Frank Lloyd Wright doghouse was perfect for him. I was very excited for my dog.\nJim Berger never built the doghouse and in 1963, at the age of 19, Jim joined the U.S. Army. That same year, after Jim's departure, his younger brother Eric and his father completed the doghouse. Eddie did not particularly like the new house and took to sleeping by the front door of the Robert Berger House instead, presumably because it was warmer there. \"That was kind of depressing,\" stated Jim Berger when reflecting on the incident.Robert Berger died in 1973 and Mrs. Berger, not seeing any value in a triangular doghouse that Eddie and the subsequent dogs they owned would not sleep in, had it hauled to the dump the same year.In 2010, while filming a documentary about buildings designed by Wright in California, Michael Miner stumbled across the doghouse story. Miner asked Jim Berger if rebuilding Eddie's House was an option. Jim, at this point a retired woodshop teacher, said that he had wanted to rebuild the doghouse for years and this was the opportunity to do so. Over the next three months Jim and his brother Eric, a skilled cabinetmaker, were filmed by Miner rebuilding the doghouse to Wright's specification in Eric's Petaluma, California garage. Jim Berger said, in relation to the construction process, \"In the letter, I said I wanted something easy to build, but this doghouse was not easy to build. It was very complicated.\"The construction process is featured in Miner's documentary, Romanza, and the rebuilt doghouse also went on a publicity tour for the film. During filming, the rebuilt doghouse was placed on the side of the Robert Berger House where the original once sat. On that day it happened to be raining and Miner noticed something peculiar about the doghouse which it had in common with other Wright-designed structures:  \"It leaks.\"\n\nDesign\nEddie's House is the smallest structure ever known to be designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and fits in well with the Robert Berger House. Eddie's House was constructed of the same materials as the larger house and the \"small triangular hut... bowed to the hexagonal geometry of the house's hexagonal plan.\" The doghouse also displays many signature design elements that have come to represent Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural style. These include an entrance hidden on the rear of the house, and a large overhang on a roof with a low pitch.When Eddie's House was actually constructed, the Berger family did not follow Wright's plans strictly. They changed the location of the door as well as not including a concrete base planned by Wright to make the doghouse portable.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\n Architecture portal\n Dogs portal\nPassage 10:\nCold Water (film)\nCold Water (French: L'eau froide) is a 1994 French film written and directed by Olivier Assayas about two troubled teenagers in France during the 1970s. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.In October, 2007, it was screened at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, where Assayas spent a week in residence introducing and discussing his films with the audiences there. He was accompanied by his friend Jean-Michel Frodon, the current director of the journal Cahiers du cinéma, of which Assayas was once the director. Assayas said the film is autobiographical, reflecting upon his own teenage years. He went out of his way to cast actors who were not professionals or who, as in the case of male lead Cyprien Fouquet (playing Gilles), had never acted before, although female lead Virginie Ledoyen (playing Christine) had appeared in several films. The film was the result of a commission from French TV, which wanted a 52-minute film but allowed Assayas to make a longer version, after some negotiations.\n\nPlot\nGilles and Christine are teenagers from unstable homes. When they do some shop-lifting together she is arrested, but he gets away. She escapes from a mental institution and meets him at an abandoned house in the country, where a large group of rebellious teenagers are having a wild, all-night party. American rock music from the period is played prominently and has a very strong effect, especially \"Me and Bobby McGee,\" sung by Janis Joplin. Drugs are used, mainly pot and hash. As the party is winding down, Gilles and Christine escape even deeper into the countryside, searching for a commune where artists are said to live without electricity or running water. This is Christine's idea, but Gilles reluctantly goes along. A jolting conclusion shows us that, as Assayas puts it, \"Gilles' real life has now begun.\"\n\nCast\nVirginie Ledoyen - Christine\nCyprien Fouquet - Gilles\nLászló Szabó - Gilles's father\nJean-Pierre Darroussin - Inspector\nJackie Berroyer - Christine's father\nDominique Faysse - Christine's mother\nSmaïl Mekki - Mourad\nJean-Christophe Bouvet - Professor\nIlona Györi - Marie\nRenée Amzallag - The nurse\nJérôme Simonin - Vendeur de dynamite\nLaetitia Lemerle - Corrine\nAlexandra Yonnet - Copine blouson\nCaroline Doron - Copine blessée\nLaetitia Giraud - Christiane\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPower factor\nIn electrical engineering, the power factor of an AC power system is defined as the ratio of the real power absorbed by the load to the apparent power flowing in the circuit.  Real power is the average of the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the electricity for performing work. Apparent power is the product of RMS current and voltage. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power may be greater than the real power, so more current flows in the circuit than would be required to transfer real power alone. A power factor magnitude of less than one indicates the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the average product of the two. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates real power, which then flows back towards the source.\nIn an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.\nPower-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loads, such as rectifiers, distort the current drawn from the system. In such cases, active or passive power factor correction may be used to counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central substation, spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.\n\nGeneral case\nThe general expression for power factor is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            power factor\n          \n        \n        =\n        P\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          P\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{power factor}}=P/P_{a}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          I\n          \n            r\n            m\n            s\n          \n        \n        \n          V\n          \n            r\n            m\n            s\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{a}=I_{rms}V_{rms}}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n   is the real power measured by an ideal wattmeter, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            r\n            m\n            s\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{rms}}\n   is the rms current measured by an ideal ammeter, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            r\n            m\n            s\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{rms}}\n   is the rms voltage measured by an ideal voltmeter.

He provided the first extensive study of the ways in which a thin film of liquid flows down inclined surfaces. Expressed as the ratio of surface tension forces to inertial forces, the Kapitza number acts as an indicator of the hydrodynamic wave regime in falling liquid films. Liquid film behavior represents a subset of the more general class of free boundary problems. and is important in a wide range of engineering and technological applications such as evaporators, heat exchangers, absorbers, microreactors, small-scale electronics/microprocessor cooling schemes, air conditioning and gas turbine blade cooling.\nAfter World War II Kapitza was removed from all his positions, including director of his Institute for Physical Problems, for refusing to work on nuclear weapons. He was at his country house and devised experiments to work on there, including his experiments on falling films of liquid.Unlike most dimensionless numbers used in the study of fluid mechanics, the Kapitza number represents a material property, as it is formed by combining powers of the surface tension, density, gravitational acceleration and kinematic viscosity.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        a\n        =\n        \n          \n            σ\n            \n              ρ\n              (\n              g\n              sin\n              ⁡\n              β\n              \n                )\n                \n                  1\n                  \n                    /\n                  \n                  3\n                \n              \n              \n                ν\n                \n                  4\n                  \n                    /\n                  \n                  3\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ka={\\frac {\\sigma }{\\rho (g\\sin \\beta )^{1/3}\\nu ^{4/3}}}}\n  where σ is the surface tension (SI units: N/m), g is gravitational acceleration (m/s2), ρ is density (kg/m3), β is inclination angle (rad), and ν is kinematic viscosity (m2/s).\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nFourier number\nIn the study of heat conduction, the Fourier number,  is the ratio of time, t, to a characteristic time scale for heat diffusion, td. This dimensionless group is named in honor of J.B.J. Fourier, who formulated the modern understanding of heat conduction. The time scale for diffusion characterizes the time needed for heat to diffuse over a distance, L. For a medium with thermal diffusivity, α, this time scale is td = L2/α, so that the Fourier number is t/td = αt/L2. The Fourier number is often denoted as Fo or FoL.The Fourier number can also be used in the study of mass diffusion, if the thermal diffusivity is replaced by a mass diffusivity.\nThe Fourier number is used in analysis of time dependent transport phenomena, generally in conjunction with the Biot number if convection is present. The Fourier number arises naturally in nondimensionalization of the heat equation.\n\nDefinition\nThe general definition of the Fourier number, Fo, is:\nFor heat diffusion with a characteristic length scale L in a medium of thermal diffusivity, α,  the diffusion time scale is td =L2/α, so that\n\nwhere:\n\nα is the thermal diffusivity (m2/s)\nt is the time (s)\nL is the characteristic length through which conduction occurs (m)\n\nInterpretation of the Fourier number\nConsider transient heat conduction in  a slab of thickness L that is initially at a uniform temperature, T0. One side of the slab is heated to higher temperature, Th at time t = 0.  The other side is adiabatic. The time needed for the other side of the object to show significant temperature change is the diffusion time, td.  \nWhen Fo ≪ 1, not enough time has passed for the other side to change temperature. In this case, significant temperature change only occurs close to the heated side, and most of the slab remains at T0.\nWhen Fo ≅ 1, significant temperature change occurs all the way through the thickness L. None of the slab remains at temperature T0.\nWhen Fo ≫ 1, enough time has passed for the slab to approach steady state. The entire slab approaches temperature Th.\n\nDerivation and usage\nThe Fourier number can be derived by nondimenionalizing the time-dependent diffusion equation.  As an example, consider a rod of length L that is being heated from an initial temperature, T0, by the imposition at time t = 0 of a higher temperature at x = L, TL (with x along the axis of the rod). The heat equation in one spatial dimension, x, can be applied \n\nwhere T is the temperature for 0 < x < L and t > 0. The differential equation can be scaled into a dimensionless form. A dimensionless temperature may be defined as Θ = (T - TL)/(T0 - TL), and the equation may be divided through by α/L2:\n\nThe resulting dimensionless time variable is the Fourier number, FoL = αt/L2. The characteristic time scale for diffusion, td =L2/α, comes directly from this scaling of the heat equation. \nThe Fourier number is frequently used as the nondimensional time in studying transient heat conduction in solids.   A second parameter, the Biot number arises in nondimensionalization when convective boundary conditions are applied to the heat equation. Together, the Fourier number and the Biot number determine the temperature response of a solid subjected to convective heating or cooling.\n\nApplication to mass transfer\nAn analogous Fourier number can be derived by nondimensionalization of Fick's second law of diffusion. The result is a mass transfer Fourier number, Fom defined as:\nwhere:\n\nFom is the mass transfer Fourier number\nD is the mass diffusivity (m2/s)\nt is the time (s)\nL is the length scale of interest (m)The mass transfer Fourier number can be applied to the study of certain time-dependent mass diffusion problems.\n\nSee also\nBiot number\nConvection\nHeat conduction\nHeat equation\nMolecular diffusion\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nElvis' Christmas Album\nElvis' Christmas Album (also reissued as It's Christmas Time) is the third studio album and first Christmas album by  American singer and musician Elvis Presley on RCA Victor, LOC -1035, a deluxe limited edition, released October 15, 1957, and recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood. It has been reissued in numerous different formats since its first release. It spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and was the first of two Christmas-themed albums Presley would record, the other being Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas, released in 1971. The publication Music Vendor listed Elvis' Christmas Album on their singles charts for two weeks in December 1957 – January 1958, with a peak position of No. 49.\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Elvis' Christmas Album along with its reissues has shipped at least 17 million copies in the United States. It is the first Presley title to attain Diamond certification by the RIAA, and is also the best-selling Christmas album of all time in the United States. With total sales of more 20 million copies worldwide, it remains the world's best-selling Christmas album and one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nContent\nThe original 1957 LP consisted of six popular Christmas songs, two traditional Christmas carols and four gospel songs which had been previously released on the EP Peace in the Valley, catalogue EPA 4054, issued March 1957, peaking at No. 3 on the Pop albums chart and at No. 39 on the singles chart. The two album sides are divided into a program of secular Christmas songs on side one, with two traditional Christmas carols and the gospel numbers on side two. These included two spirituals by innovator Thomas A. Dorsey, \"Peace in the Valley\" and \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\". Coincidentally, A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra, released the previous month, was also divided into secular and traditional sides.\nWhile most of the songs selected were traditional Christmas fare, such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Silent Night\", two new songs by regular suppliers of material for Presley were commissioned. One was \"Santa Bring My Baby Back (to Me)\" and the other (selected by Presley to open the album), was a blues-based rock and roll number, \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. This writer/producer team was responsible for some of 1950s rhythm and blues and rock and roll's most finely-honed satire in their work with the Coasters, as well as penning \"Hound Dog\" for Willie Mae Thornton and providing Presley with some of his biggest hits, including \"Jailhouse Rock\" and \"Don't\".\nPresley asked the pair to come up with another Christmas song during sessions for the album; within a few minutes, they had the song written and ready for recording. Originally titled \"Christmas Blues\", this slyly risqué number is given a full-throated treatment by Presley who, aided by the gritty ensemble playing from his band, was determined to ensure that this Christmas album would not be easily ignored. Much of the remaining program was performed in a more traditional manner appropriate to the solemnity of Christmas, although Presley's innate sense of occasion shone through on his left-of-center reading of Ernest Tubb's 1949 hit, \"Blue Christmas\".\n\"Silent Night\" and \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" were arranged by Presley himself.\nThe Bing Crosby holiday perennial \"White Christmas\", which appeared every year on the Billboard charts from 1942 to 1962, became the center of controversy upon the album's release, with calls by the song's composer Irving Berlin to have the song, and the entire album, banned from radio airplay. After hearing Presley's version of his song, which Berlin saw as a \"profane parody of his cherished yuletide standard\", he ordered his staff in New York to telephone radio stations across the United States, demanding the song be discontinued from radio play. While most US radio stations ignored Berlin's request, at least one disc jockey was fired for playing a song from the album, and most Canadian stations refused to play the album.The controversy was, ironically, fueled by Presley's performance of the song in a style mirroring the version by Clyde McPhatter's group, The Drifters, which had been a Top 10 hit on the R&B singles chart in 1954 and 1955. Unlike Presley's recording, however, their version attracted virtually no adverse reaction, and certainly no reported opposition from Berlin. Part of the reason that The Drifters' version of \"White Christmas\" was less controversial was that this version was played only on black radio stations. Presley's version brought greater attention to The Drifters' version which gained prominence with its inclusion in the 1990 movie Home Alone.\n\nPackaging\nOriginal 1957 copies of Elvis' Christmas Album (LOC-1035) were issued with a red booklet-like album cover (as shown above) featuring promotional photos from Presley's third movie Jailhouse Rock. Even rarer than the cover and record itself is a gold foil price tag-shaped \"gift giving\" sticker attached to the shrink wrap, reading \"TO __________, FROM _____________, ELVIS SINGS\", followed by a list of the tracks. Original copies with the gold sticker intact on the shrink wrap have proven to be among the most valuable of Presley's albums. Adding to its already high value are limited red vinyl albums and album covers with gold print down the spine.\nRecord labels for all original 1957 pressings are black with all-silver print, the famous RCA Victor \"His Master's Voice\" dog logo at the top of the label, and \"LONG 331⁄3 PLAY\" at the bottom.\n\n45 RPM releases\nThe other new composition on the album, \"Santa, Bring My Baby Back to Me\" was paired with \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\", and issued as the UK single concurrently with the album's release. The single reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart in November 1957.No singles were issued in the US until 1964, when \"Blue Christmas\" was paired with \"Wooden Heart\", and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Christmas Singles chart; however, a pairing of \"Blue Christmas\" b/w \"White Christmas\" became a Top 20 UK hit in late 1964. \"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\"/\"Blue Christmas\" was a 1965 single release for the US market, and reached No. 4 on the Billboard Christmas Singles chart. \"Blue Christmas\" would re-enter the Christmas or Holiday Singles chart several times in the years that follow.Two different EPs, Elvis Sings Christmas Songs, EPA 4108 in December 1957, and Christmas with Elvis, EPA 4340 in December 1958, divided the eight Christmas numbers between them. The former topped the newly established Billboard EP Chart, whileing the video, however Cannon dispelled the rumors on Twitter, saying \"I am NOT directing.\" The video for \"Oh Santa!\" premiered on entertainment news program Access Hollywood on November 2, 2010. Prior to its release, various media outlets speculated that the video was going incorporate the same on-set style as seen in Outkast's music video for their 2003 single \"Hey Ya!\", with the singer as the main feature in front of  a large audience. Carey's fan site MariahDaily posted a message on their website asking people within the Los Angeles area to appear for a casting call for a chance to be featured in the video.\n\nSynopsis\nThe video draws influence from the 1950s and 1960s variety shows and features Carey wearing a short, red \"sexy Santa\" ensemble, whilst on stage with a band, which featured gospel backup singers as well as a group of dancers, consisting of cheerleaders. The plotline is centered on Carey hosting a \"Mariah Carey Christmas\" television show. The announcer introduces Carey saying \"here she is, the greatest singer of all time, Ms. Mariah Carey!\". The video then shows Carey's backup singers belting out the chorus while the singer is seen performing in front of a cheering audience. Her collection of fragrances is also advertised in the opening. In the second half of the video, Santa Claus makes an appearance, waving to friends and sharing a hug with Carey. The video ends with the singer laughing while the audience cheers and claps for her performance.\n\nReception\nBecky Bain of Idolator commented on the simple structure and themes of the video, writing \"There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand-waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes.\" Bain also observed that the vast majority of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close-up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above so that the viewer was not able to easily recognize that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing \"Of course, it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart out with that famous eight-octave range ... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you longing for a sip of eggnog.\"\n\nRemixes\nWhen the song was first released as a single in 2010, six dance remixes were commissioned and were later released as a digital EP. A mashup of the song with 1994's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" produced by Jump Smokers titled \"Oh Santa! All I Want for Christmas Is You (Holiday Mashup)\" was also released on December 13, 2010.\n\nTrack listings and formats\nCharts\nTenth anniversary version featuring Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson\nFor the tenth anniversary of the song, Carey re-recorded and re-released the song commercially as a new remix. Carey recorded the new version of the song with Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. The new version served as the lead single from Carey's second soundtrack album, Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special. The song was released across all streaming platforms on December 4, 2020, accompanied by its official music video, premiered the same day on Carey's YouTube account.\n\nBackground\nTalking to Billboard, Carey stated in regards to the song that \"originally, I was blending with myself [...] but it was cool to be able to work with the different vocal textures and play around with it and reimagine it.\" She went on to describe the song as a \"girl group moment\".\n\nReception\nThe remix received positive reviews on release. Billboard writer Rania Aniftos wrote that the three singers \"trading verses and harmonies\" amounts for a \"truly angelic result\". Chris Murphy, writer for Vulture went on to say that \"the trio, the remix, and the accompanying music video absolutely makes the nice list in every possible way.\"In its first week of release, the song sold 10,000 downloads in the United States and 9,250 equivalent units in the United Kingdom.\n\nCharts\nRelease history\nSee also\nList of Billboard Adult Contemporary number ones of 2010\nList of Billboard Adult Contemporary number ones of 2011\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart\nPassage 10:\nBlack Elvis/Lost in Space\nBlack Elvis/Lost in Space is the fourth solo studio album by American rapper and producer Kool Keith, and his first release under the alias of 'Black Elvis'. It was intended to be released the same day as First Come, First Served, but was pushed back by Columbia Records and ended up being released four months later on August 10, 1999 through Relativity Entertainment Distribution rather than Sony Music Distribution, denoted by the WK prefix instead of the customary CK prefix and the legal copy on the release.  Black Elvis 2 followed in 2023.\n\nBackground\nKool Keith uses very complex rhymes on various subject matters from Black Elvis' viewpoint on half of the album and on the other half elaborates on space travel and being lost in space. This is the first album for which Keith handled all of the production, although drum programming was done by Kutmasta Kurt and Marc Live. Sadat X, Black Silver, Roger Troutman, Motion Man, Kid Capri and Pimpin' Rex made guest appearances on the record.\nA promotional video was made for the track \"Livin' Astro\" which aired on a few episodes of the MTV show Amp in early 2000. The video features Kool Keith acting as several different personas amidst a sci-fi backdrop that resembles the Black Elvis/Lost in Space album cover. The personas include the Original Black Elvis, Orange Man, the Kid in the Commercial, Lonnie Hendrex, and Light-Blue Cop.\nKool Keith was displeased with the lack of promotion for the Black Elvis project, and vented his frustrations about his label on the songs \"Release Date\" and \"Test Press.\" He also published the e-mail addresses of several Ruffhouse executives, asking his fans to demand better promotion.\n\nReception\nThe album peaked at number 180 on the US Billboard 200, #74 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, #10 on the Heatseekers Albums.\n\nTrack listing\nSample credits\nTrack 5 contains elements from \"Come Go With Me\" by Teddy Pendergrass (1979)\nTrack 8 contains elements from \"Our House\" by Madness (1982)\nTrack 11 contains elements from \"Snake\" by Charles Earland (1973)\nTrack 16 contains elements from \"You Used to Love Me\" by Faith Evans (1995)\n\nPersonnel\nCharts\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Camp Casey was named in 1952 after Major Hugh Boyd Casey, who was killed in a plane crash near the camp site during the Korean War. Camp Casey is one of several U.S. Army bases in South Korea near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Camp Casey, Camp Hovey, and neighboring Camp Castle and Camp Mobile hold the main armor, 7th Division of a bridging engineer company as well, and mechanized infantry elements of the 2nd Infantry Division (United States) in South Korea. Camp Castle has been largely abandoned, with only a warehouse remaining. Camp Mobile was severely damaged during a flood in July 2011, and has been abandoned except for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) company. Camp Casey spans 3,500 acres (14 km2) and is occupied by 6,300 military personnel and 2,500 civilians. There are plans for the relocation of most of the 2nd Infantry Division to Camp Humphreys which are underway with the latest estimate for completion being 2022. The Field Artillery Battalion remains for now at Camp Casey, while Camp Hovey is to be closed.Camp Casey was home to several of the main combat units of the Second Infantry Division. Among them were the Second Battalion of the 9th Infantry Regiment. the First Battalion of the 72nd Armored Regiment (Crusaders), and the 210th Field Artillery Brigade. The 70th Brigade Support Battalion is currently located on Camp Casey, providing support to the line battalions of the brigade as well as depot and medical support to everyone stationed in the Camp Casey area.

Butler in Okinawa, Japan.  It is one of three active duty infantry divisions in the Marine Corps and together with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1stMAW) and the 3rd Marine Logistics Group (3rd MLG) forms the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF).  The division was first formed during World War II and saw four years of continuous combat in the Vietnam War. Today, elements of the 3rd Marine Division are continuously forward deployed and forward postured to carry out the US Government's mission of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific in conjunction with its sister services.\n\nSubordinate units\nHeadquarters Battalion\n 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment\n 4th Marine Regiment (Infantry)\n 12th Marine Regiment (Artillery)\n 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion\n Jungle Warfare Training Center, Okinawa (Transitioning to TECOM)\n\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe 3rd Marine Division was officially activated on September 16, 1942 at Camp Elliott, San Diego, California. Most of the original members of the division were drawnwounded as he attempted to cover the retreat. With all the other officers down, Joseph E. Johnston took charge and organized a successful retreat. The men and boats left after dark to return to Fort Pierce. One boat, containing gunpowder and alcohol, was accidentally left behind in the dark. After recovering a lost man initially thought to be killed, Powell reported his losses as 4 killed and 22 wounded.\n\nSecond Battle of the Loxahatchee (Jesup's Battle)\nNotified that Powell had definitively located a group of Seminoles, Major General Thomas S. Jesup brought his army overland from Fort Pierce, passing west of the St. Lucie River and approaching the Seminole encampment from the west. Jesup had a force of about 1,500 men: 600 dragoons (2nd Dragoons under Col. William S. Harney), 400 artillery (part of the 3rd US Artillery under Colonel Lemuel Gates), 400 Tennessee Volunteers (under Major William Lauderdale), 100 Alabama Volunteers, and 35 Delaware Indian scouts.On the afternoon of January 24, Jesup's scouts located the Seminoles in a dense hammock. Jesup's men dragoons and infantry attacked, with support from cannons and Congreve rockets. The Seminoles fell back across the Loxahatchee River and took up a second position on the east bank. Jesup attempted to lead the Tennessee Volunteers in a charge, but had his glasses shot off his face. Col. Harney led 15 dragoons across the river upstream of the Seminoles and flanked their position, causing them to retreat in scattered groups and ending the battle.This engagement is considered the last true battle of the Second Seminole War.\n\nResults\nAfter the battle, Jesup's march marched east to what is now Pennock Point where they established Fort Jupiter. The general unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to allow the Seminoles to remain in the Everglades and end the war.\nWilliam Lauderdale's Tennessee Volunteers subsequently marched south from Jupiter to New River where they established Fort Lauderdale.\n\nNotable participants\nJoseph E. Johnston was a volunteer at the First Battle of the Loxahatchee, having not yet been officially recommissioned in the Army. He claimed that there were \"no less than 30 bullet holes\" in his clothing, with one bullet cutting his scalp, leaving him with a scar. After receiving his commission as 1st Lieutenant on July 7, 1838, Johnston was given a brevet promotion to captain for his actions. He later became a Confederate general.Thomas S. Jesup was a US Army officer known as the \"Father of the Modern Quartermaster Corps.\" His military career spanned 52 years, starting in the War of 1812 and ending after 42 years as Quartermaster General. In 1836, President Andrew Jackson detached him from his title as Quartermaster General. First, to deal with the Creek tribe in Georgia and Alabama and then to assume command of all U.S. troops in Florida during the Second Seminole War.\nWilliam Lauderdale is the namesake of Fort Lauderdale.\nSam Jones was the spiritual medicine and war chief of the Miccosukee and Seminole people during the Second and Third Seminole Wars.\n\nBattlefield today\nThe exact location of both battlefields was unclear for most of the 20th century. At one time it was incorrectly identified as having taken place in modern Jonathan Dickinon State Park, with a marker placed there accordingly. In the 1980s, numerous avocational archaeologists, not all of them working together, concluded Jesup's battle occurred in Jupiter Farms along the Loxahatchee River Northwest Fork around and south of Indiantown Road (SR 706). An extensive archaeological survey by professional archaeologist Robert S. Carr and his Archaeological and Historical Conservancy (AHC) confirmed the location of the battlefield as well as numerous Seminole and pre-Seminole archaeological sites in Riverbend Park. The part of the park where the battle took place is now Loxahatchee River Battlefield Park. The park is managed by Palm Beach County Parks and Recreation.\nThe exact location of Powell's Battle is less clear, but probably occurred east of Riverbend Park.\nStarting in 2017, the Loxahatchee Battlefield Preservationists (LBP) have held an annual battle reenactment in late January.\n\nSee also\nList of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas\nWest Indies Squadron\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nCamp Hovey\nCamp Hovey is a United States Army military base in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.

Six Afghan civilians from the same family were killed in the air strike in the Baraki Barak district of Logar province, Afghanistan. Four insurgents and three Afghan army members were also killed.Logar provincial police chief Ghulam Sakhi Rogh Lewani said the operation had targeted a Taliban commander, Qari Hijran, who had a bounty on his head. The top official in the district, Mohammad Rahim Amin, claimed that the incident occurred when a local teacher provided shelter for the commander in his home.\nPassage 2:\nBaraki Barak District\nBaraki Barak District (Persian: ولسوالی برکی برک ; Pashto: برکي برک ولسوالۍ) is situated in the western part of Logar Province, Afghanistan. It borders Wardak Province to the west and northwest, Puli Alam District to the north and east and Kharwar and Charkh districts to the south. The district's population is around 101,000(2006) with a majority of over 90% Tajiks. The district center is the town of Baraki Barak - the former provincial capital, located in the northern part of the district in the valley of the Logar River. Baraki Rajan is another important town of this district which lies 4 km away from district center. The district is named after the historical Ormur tribe, also locally known as Baraki.\n\nPolitics and security\nDuring the Soviet-Afghan War, the Soviet forces perpetrated the Baraki Barak massacre in September 1984.The Baraki Barak District Sub-Governor is Mohammad Rahim \"Amin\".  Mr. Rahim replaced Yasin Lodin in January 2010 Mr. Rahim called the first Shura for his newly elected District Community Council (DCC) in February 2010.  The 45 member council consists of elected representatives from the five sub-districts of Baraki Barak, religious leaders and five female representatives.  The DCC is sub-divided into three sectors: Security, Rule of Law and Development.   The female representatives will serve in the Development Sector.  According to the Afghanistan Social Outreach Program (ASOP), the community councils will also \"strengthen security by fostering community solidarity, provide a forum for conflict resolution and provide quality assurance for sustainable development projects.\"\nThe 8 March marked the first time International Women's Day (IWD) was celebrated in Baraki Barak District.  76 burqa clad women began arriving at the District Center as early as 08:30.  General Khatol Mohammadzai was the keynote speaker at the ceremony and the only female General in the Afghan National Army (ANA).  General Mohammadzai is also the only woman to be airborne qualified with more than 500 free and competition parachute jumps.  General Mohammadzai spoke about the equality of men and women and expressed her hope that other women might follow in her footsteps and also fight for Afghanistan's future by joining the ANA.   The General is also an accomplished poet and has written poetry that proclaims the importance of women.  General Mohammadzai's poems condemn discrimination and harsh treatment of women.  Other speakers included Sub-Governor Rahim Amin and a female member of the Afghan Parliament – Dr. Shakila Hashimi.  Upon completion of the ceremony General Khatol Mohammadzai assisted in distributing humanitarian assistance to every woman attending the ceremony.\nOn 27 October 2009 the Baraki Barak District Center officially opened. The district center houses offices for the district sub-governor, the local mayor and three judges who handle everything from land disputes to criminal issues.On 22 November 2009 it was reported that several militants were detained in both the village of Kashimiri Bala and Ebrahim Kheyl in an attempt to locate a Taliban weapons facilitator actively operating in the area.On 23 November 2009 it was reported that a government employee was abducted in the district.According to some reports, as of 1 December 2009, insurgent activity has gone down as much as 80% since the summer of 2009 in the district capital although this could be attributed to the arrival of the winter months. The 2009 Afghan \"surge\" was stated to have created a security bubble for the district capital, covering about half of the district's population. However the increase in aid and US troops to the region has caused additional problems, as more civilians are targeted by the Taliban for co-operating with the government and foreign forces.\nIn 2008 the area experienced an influx of anti-government forces into the district. Around the beginning of 2009, no American troops were located in this district, a fact which has changed significantly as of the end of the same year as the new \"Ink Spot\" strategy was implemented in the area. As of 1 December 2009, at least 150 American troops from the 10th Mountain Division were located in the district, among others. Furthermore, attacks are down approximately 50% and thousands of refugees have begun to return to the area.\n\nSee also\nDistricts of Afghanistan\nPassage 3:\nBaraki Barak\nBarakī Barak (Dari/Pashto/Ormuri: برکی برک) is a town and the center of Baraki Barak District, Logar Province, Afghanistan.

Camptowns usually take the same name as the district in which they are located. For example, as mentioned the camptown for Maseru is Maseru but also the camptown for Thaba-Tseka District is Thaba-Tseka. The exceptions to this rule are Berea District whose capital is called Teyateyaneng, Quthing District whose capital is called Moyeni and Leribe District whose capital is most often called Hlotse.\nIt presumably derives from the 19th century police camps, then (now archaic) in Sesotho likampo.

The event served as the opening round of the 2014 World Endurance Championship, and overall race winners were awarded the annual Tourist Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club.  Toyota became the first Japanese manufacturer to win Silverstone's endurance race, with Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi, and Nicolas Lapierre leading the team's second TS040 Hybrid to a 1–2 finish.  The race, which had run under mixed weather conditions, was stopped in the final half-hour of competition due to heavy rains and not restarted.Porsche, making their return to the prototype categories with the debuting 919 Hybrid, completed the overall race podium with third place. Accidents ended the race of both Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars after the World Champions had started strongly.  Rebellion Racing's Nicolas Prost, Nick Heidfeld, and Mathias Beche were the only team to reach the finish in the LMP1-L category, while G-Drive Racing's Morgan-Nissan won the LMP2 class.

First run in 1976 as part of the World Sportscar Championship, the race was a part of the FIA World Endurance Championship between 2013 and 2019, but the 2020 race was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the race didn’t return for 2021. The RAC Tourist Trophy has been awarded to the winners of the event.\n\nHistory\nIn 1975, a round of the World Championship of Makes was not held in Britain for one of the first times since 1966. The 1000 km Brands Hatch which had been run almost consecutively during that period went under hiatus while track upgrades were carried out. Following upgrades of its own in 1975, plans were made for sportscars to return to Britain by using Silverstone instead of Brands Hatch. The event was a six-hour endurance, part of the Group 5 World Championship.\nThe first running consisted of a small field as some season competitors chose not to compete. British drivers John Fitzpatrick and Tom Walkinshaw managed to upset the factory teams by scoring the inaugural victory in a BMW. The following year, competition grew as the factory Porsche team, under the guise of Martini Racing, earned their first of two consecutive victories for drivers Jochen Mass and Jacky Ickx. The Porsche factory team was not able to continue their streak into 1979 when their lead car crashed, leaving the privateer Gelo Racing Porsche to a dominant win.\n1980 saw the first victory by a sports-prototype. Alain de Cadenet managed to win the home event as a driver, team owner, as well as a constructor when he and Desiré Wilson won by 18 seconds in a car of his own design. A Group 5 car took its final victory in 1981 with the all-German Velga Racing Team before the class was phased out.\n1982 was the first year of the Group C category in the World Championship, although the race that year was actually won by an older Group 6 Lancia. The first Group C victory came in 1983 as Porsche returned to their factory dominance of the event, going on to win the 1984 and 1985 events as well. Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass still hold record of most wins, having won the race four times in 1977, 1978, 1984 and 1985. In 1986 British success returned as the Jaguar factory team was able to upset Porsche for the first time since the company had returned to racing. Jaguar then began to dominate in a fashion similar to Porsche, as they too won the next two years.  American Eddie Cheever co-drove in each of the three victories.\nNo race was held in 1989 as Donington temporarily replaced Silverstone on the schedule, but sportscars returned in 1990 for a shorter 480 km event. Jaguar returned to their winning ways straight away before going on to earn a fifth straight victory in a 430 km event in 1991. Only after Jaguar officially retired from the World Championship was another manufacturer able to once again earn victory at Silverstone, this time being Peugeot. A lack of entrants however lead to the cancellation of the World Championship, temporarily ending endurance racing at the circuit. The race did make a one-yearῥιπή (rhipḗ, “swing or force with which anything is thrown”), from ῥίπτω (rhíptō, \"to throw\").\n\nBridges\nThere are two road bridges across the strait, both at Chalcis. One is the Euripus Bridge or Chalcis Bridge, a two-pylon, cable-suspended bridge built south of town in 1992, and commonly called the \"New\" or \"High\" bridge, with a span of about 215 m (705 ft). The strait is 160 m (525 ft) wide at this point.  The bridge is accessible via a fork on the main road at Aulis.\nThe \"Old\" or \"Low\" or \"Sliding\" Bridge lies across midtown, and can slide away to allow shipping traffic. It is located at the narrowest point of the strait, where it is only 38 m (125 ft) wide.  It accommodates two lanes of vehicular traffic.  It was originally built as a retractable bridge in 1858, replaced by a rotating one in 1896.  The existing, originally wooden bridge was built in 1962 and was extensively refurbished in 1998.\n\nHistory\nThe Euripus was closed by a dike of coarse sediment until about 6000 years ago, when it was opened by an (unrecorded) earthquake. Herodotus mentions the strait during his description of the Battle of Artemisium (480 BC), with the account implying that it was navigable by large fleets of triremes. Diodorus Siculus reports that in 411 BC the Euboeans closed the strait by mostly rebuilding the dike, with the goal of making themselves part of Boeotia, therefore not an island subject to Athenian hegemony. Diodorus states that gaps had to be left in the dike to allow the Euripus tides to flow through; the narrowness of the remaining passage made the current much more intense. Only a single passage was left navigable, just wide enough for a single ship. There is no mention of the closure of the strait in either Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War or Xenophon's Hellenica. Strabo wrote that at an unspecified later date the strait was crossed by a bridge two plethra long (approximately 50 m (160 ft), which is probably an exaggeration). Some vestiges of the artificial dike probably remained, so the gap spanned by the bridge could have been narrower than the channel that existed before 411 BC. Ancient historians do not record the depth of the channel; even the passage under Strabo's bridge may have been scoured by the tides to a depth sufficient for ancient shipping.Procopius reports that during the reign of Emperor Justinian I (527 to 565 AD) there were two channels in the Euripus, the large original channel and a new narrower cleft to the east of it, so narrow that it could be crossed with a single plank of wood. This later stream was later widened to make the present shipping channel. At the time when Procopius wrote, the name of the fortress on the Euripus was probably \"Euripus,\" which had become \"Egripos\" by 1204, and was adopted and slightly altered to \"Nigriponte\" by the Latins who occupied the place in 1205.  (The name has nothing to do with any sort of \"Black Bridge,\" except as a Veronese or Venetian joke, or folk-etymological corruption or re-interpretation in reference to the old bridge across the channel.)\n\nIn 1395, Nicola di Martoni came to Negropont during the return from his pilgrimage to Egypt and Palestine.  He is clear that the main shipping channel in the Venetian period was on the side of the Boeotian mainland, and mentions the mills on the narrower channel, which he says were sometimes broken in the speed and turbulence of the flow there.\nWe have further information about the shipping channel and its single wooden bridge from various documents in the archives of the Venetian Empire. In 1408, the formation of a reef under the bridge severely affected shipping (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm  Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti. 48,43v) and in 1439 there was concern over the tendency of the current to erode the surroundings of the pilings that supported the bridge  (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm  Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti. 60,140r–42r).Evliya Çelebi, in his Travel Journal (SN VIII250a27, ff.), tells us that the narrow channel was first opened out enough for a galley to pass through at some time in the late 16th century, and was still just barely wide enough at the time of his visit in 1668 for a galley to squeeze through, even though the old shipping channel had been abandoned.\nBy the end of the 18th century it was well on its way to being the width of the modern channel.\n\nSee also\nList of Greek place names\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\n2013 6 Hours of Silverstone\nThe 2013 6 Hours of Silverstone was an auto racing event held at the Silverstone Circuit, near Silverstone, England on 12–14 April 2013.  The event was the opening round of the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season, and served as the annual award for the Royal Automobile Club's Tourist Trophy.  Briton Allan McNish, Dane Tom Kristensen, and Frenchman Loïc Duval won the race for Audi, just over three seconds ahead of their teammates.  The British Delta-ADR team were victorious in the LMP2 category, while Aston Martin Racing secured both the LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am classes.\nThe event weekend was shared with the European Le Mans Series, which ran the 3 Hours of Silverstone, and the FIA European Formula 3 Championship.\n\nQualifying\nThe 6 Hours of Silverstone was the first instance in which the WEC utilized a new qualifying procedure in which two drivers were required to set laps during the qualifying session.  The grid would then be determined by averaging the total of the two best laps set by each of the drivers.  Following the Silverstone qualifying session, several drivers felt the new format was too risky as all teams only had enough time to set four laps during the wet session.  The FIA later announced that qualifying would be extended by ten minutes for the next round at Spa to allow teams more leeway.\n\nQualifying result\nPole position winners in each class are marked in bold.\n\nRace\nRace result\nClass winners in bold.

The book is the sequel to the bestselling book Three Cups of Tea and tells the story of Mortenson's humanitarian efforts to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan with his non-profit charity organization, Central Asia Institute (CAI).  CAI reports that as of 2010, it has overseen the building over 171 schools in the two countries. These schools reportedly provide education to over 64,000 children, including 54,000 girls, where few education opportunities existed before in the remote regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nSummary\nStones into Schools picks up where Three Cups of Tea left off in late 2003.  Tracing the efforts of CAI to work in the northeast corner of Afghanistan, the book describes how the book's author and Sarfraz Khan worked to establish the first schools in the area.  Mortenson and Khan's efforts were thwarted for a time when a devastating earthquake hit the Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan.  CAI assisted with relief efforts in the region by setting up temporary tent schools and later build several earthquake-proof schools.  After CAI's relief efforts were completed, the non-profit charity organization then opens schools in areas controlled by the Taliban and Mortenson assists the US military to formulate strategic plans in the region.\n\nAdvice solicited by US Military in Afghanistan\nDue to attention paid to Mortenson's books first by their wives,  US military leaders in Afghanistan have sought Mortenson's advice on how to work with the elders of local Afghan communities since 2007.  Seeking his knowledge on dealing with Afghan elders, the military has also included Mortenson as an active participant in meetings between the elders and US military commanders.  He has not, however, accepted any payment for his services, nor does he have any contractual or other formal relationship with the US military.\n\nCriticism\nAllegations\nOn the April 17, 2011 broadcast of CBS News' 60 Minutes, correspondent Steve Kroft alleged inaccuracies in Stones into Schools and its prequel, Three Cups of Tea.  In particular, CBS News disputed  Mortenson's claim that he got lost near K2 and ended up in Korphe; that he was captured by the Taliban in 1996; whether the number of schools built and supported by CAI is accurate; and the propriety in the use of CAI funds for Mortenson's book tours. 60 Minutes asked Mortenson for an interview prior to their broadcast, but Mortenson did not respond to their requests.Jon Krakauer, a former financial supporter of CAI, has also questioned Mortenson's accounts separately and was interviewed for the 60 Minutes segment. The day after the broadcast, Krakauer released his allegations in a lengthy online article, Three Cups of Deceit - How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way.Mansur Khan Mahsudhe, a tribesmen Greg Mortenson describes as a kidnapper in Stones into Schools, states he is \"looking into how to sue\" Greg Mortenson for what he claims are lies about him.\n\nResponse to allegations\nIn response to the allegations made against him and his books, Mortenson wrote a statement that was published in the Bozeman Chronicle: \"I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students.\" Mortenson further stated, \"The time about our final days on K2 and ongoing journey to Korphe village and Skardu is a compressed version of events that took place in the fall of 1993...\"Scott Darsney, a respected mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, wrote an email subsequently turned into an exclusive article for Outside magazine's online version as a response to the allegations against Mortenson. Darnsey questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the 60 Minutes report. Darnsey had been interviewed by Krakauer, and maintained that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said.\nAs a response to Krakauer's allegations, CAI produced a comprehensive list of projects completed over a period of years and projects CAI is currently working on. The list was released in December, 2011 (see external links below).\nPassage 2:\nSocrates\nSocrates (; Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470–399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy and among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, Socrates authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing figure in Athenian society. In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape.\nPlato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity. They demonstrate the Socratic approach to areas of philosophy including epistemology and ethics. The Platonic Socrates lends his name to the concept of the Socratic method, and also to Socratic irony. The Socratic method of questioning, or elenchus, takes shape in dialogue using short questions and answers, epitomized by those Platonic texts in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine various aspects of an issue or an abstract meaning, usually relating to one of the virtues, and find themselves at an impasse, completely unable to define what they thought they understood. Socrates is known for proclaiming his total ignorance; he used to say that the only thing he was aware of was his ignorance, seeking to imply that the realization of our ignorance is the first step in philosophizing.\nSocrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and has continued to do so in the modern era. He was studied by medieval and Islamic scholars and played an important role in the thought of the Italian Renaissance, particularly within the humanist movement. Interest in him continued unabated, as reflected in the works of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature, and popular culture have made him a widely known figure in the Western philosophical tradition.\n\nSources and the Socratic problem\nSocrates did not document his teachings. All that is known about him comes from the accounts of others: mainly the philosopher Plato and the historian Xenophon, who were both his pupils; the AOctober 2001, while a journalist at The New York Times, Sorkin started DealBook, a newsletter about deal-making and Wall Street.

In both media he claims to be a scientist who knows the cure to the zombie plague and is being escorted to Washington, D.C. by Sgt. Abraham Ford and Rosita Espinosa, and encounter Rick Grimes and his group and recruit them to assist their mission.\nEugene possesses virtually no survival skills of his own and is extremely dependent on the group, but is highly intelligent and resourceful in using technology to ensure the group's survival. Eventually, it is revealed that Eugene is not a scientist, but a high school science teacher, and that he does not know how to cure the virus but lied to manipulate the other survivors into taking him to Washington, D.C. believing it to be the best chance for survival. This proves true as the group eventually finds the Alexandria Safe-Zone where Eugene becomes its primary engineer. Though his lie puts a strain on their friendship, Abraham eventually forgives him and they resume being friends.\n\nAppearances\nComic book series\nEugene first appears at Hershel's farm, which is now occupied by the remaining prison survivors. Eugene claims to know what has caused the plague, but will not disclose any information with the remaining survivors, including Abraham and Rosita. He says he will only share information with officials in Washington, D.C. His lie, along with a belief that Washington is the only safezone, prompts the rest of the survivors to head there in hopes of long-term survival.During the journey, Eugene studies various zombies in order to gain knowledge about them, but is careful to shadow the convoy to protect himself.Eugene's deception is discovered after the Hunter ordeal. Everyone learns of his true career as a science teacher, and that he is using the radio as an excuse to get to Washington, D.C. He is hated by the group after this but remains a member, travelling with them to the Alexandria Safe-Zone, where he lives alone. After Rosita and Abraham break up, she moves in with Eugene, where he tries to create a relationship between them. Eugene eventually realizes he can begin to manufacture bullets in a repair shop nearby, where Abraham is killed when they scout it out only moments after they make amends. During the war with Negan, the shop is overrun by walkers and Eugene with his crew are captured by Negan. They are tortured for information but eventually escape with the help of Dwight, taking a van with a mix of Alexandrians and defecting Saviours back.After the two-year time jump, Eugene and Rosita have a strained relationship. He works on many projects in the zone and is now a respected member of the community. It turns out Rosita is pregnant by another man but Eugene vows to raise the child like his own.\n\nTelevision series\nSeason 4\nEugene, Abraham and Rosita are introduced to Tara and Glenn in the episode \"Inmates\". Eugene claims to be a scientist with vital information to end the pandemic and needs to get to Washington D.C., having secured Abraham and Rosita's escort (\"Claimed\"). Tara and Glenn join them, and soon their group is reunited with Maggie, Sasha, and Bob (\"Us\"). Eugene convinces Abraham that they should join with this group as they make their way to Terminus for supplies and more recruits. However, the group becomes captives of the residents of Terminus when they arrive (\"A\").\n\nSeason 5\nRick Grimes helps to save Eugene and the other captured group from Terminus (\"No Sanctuary\") and continue to make their way north, taking shelter in the former church run by Father Gabriel (\"Strangers\"). After a day, Abraham believes they must continue on, but Rick wants to wait for Daryl and Carol who had gone looking for Beth. Abraham's group is joined by Tara, Glenn, and Maggie as they take one of the church buses to drive north. (\"Four Walls and a Roof\"). During a stop, Eugene purposely sabotages the bus, admitting he fears being abandoned if he does not succeed in abolishing the epidemic. Abraham finds a fire truck that allows them to continue, until they run into a section of road that is overwhelmed by hundreds of walkers  blocking their path. As the others try to figure out if they can go around, Eugene admits that he lied about being a scientist, having only used it to coerce Abraham into protecting him. Enraged, Abraham punches him, knocking Eugene out (\"Self Help\"). Once he recovers, the group decides to return to rejoin Rick's group, who had failed to save Beth after she had been kidnapped to Atlanta (\"Crossed\").\nSome time later, the group is invited to join the Alexandria Safe Zone community, a suburban development protected by strong walls. Eugene helps with maintenance of the community, and goes with Glenn, Noah, Tara, Aiden, and Nicholas to get electronics supplies from a nearby warehouse. The inexperienced Alexandrians Aiden and Nicholas create more problems, leading Tara to be injured. While Glenn and Noah attempt to cover for them, Eugene helps to rescue Tara to their van, and fights off Nicholas who wants to try to ditch the others and flee back to Alexandria with the van. Glenn arrives to stop Nicholas in time (\"Spend\"). Back in Alexandria, while watching over Tara as she heals, Eugene and Abraham apologize to each other, and Eugene thanks Abraham for getting them to Alexandria (\"Conquer\").\n\nSeason 6\nIn the season premiere, \"First Time Again\", Eugene is in the food pantry gathering food for himself when he overhears one Alexandrian, Carter, trying to convince Deanna's son Spencer, Tobin, Francine, and Olivia to help kill Rick and take back Alexandria from Rick as he believes they are becoming dangerous and power-hungry. Eugene drops a glass jar which alerts Carter of his presence. Carter approaches Eugene and says that he heard the plan before aiming his gun at Eugene. Eugene states that he didn't hear anything. He is almost killed by Carter, but is saved as Rick, Michonne, and newcomer Morgan Jones walk in on them and disarm Carter. In \"JSS\", Eugene meets Dr. Denise Cloyd, who is the new doctor after Pete's death. In \"Heads Up\", Eugene is seen attending Rosita's lesson on how to use a machete, but seems very distracted by the noise of the walkers outside. He admits that he's scared of dying; Rosita tells him that dying is easy and that watching friends die is much harder to bear. In the mid-season finale, \"Start to Finish\", Eugene is rescued by Tara and Rosita from the herd of walkers, seconds after hearing Daryl on the radio and letting out a cry of help. The three seek refuge and get trapped in a nearby garage. Later, Eugene uses his lock-picking skills to escape the room. They stumble into the same room where Owen is holding Denise captive, with Carol and Morgan unconscious on the floor.Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji.

By thirteen, taking his music seriously, he enrolled on a course of classical guitar lessons. The disciplines he learned were good grounding for him, but he soon realised his interest lay outside of the classical sphere, and moved towards rock and blues. At first he was influenced by his childhood heroes, Larry Carlton, Steely Dan, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Buddy Guy and later Frank Zappa. Gooch replaced Alvin Lee in Ten Years After, with  limited success, and later formed Hundred Seventy Split with bassist Leo Lyons.\nIn January 2014, it was announced that both Gooch and Lyons had left Ten Years After.\n\nAlbum discography\nSiRO\n\nSiRO – 1999Ten Years After\n\nNow – 2004\nRoadworks (Live) – 2005\nEvolution – 2008\nLive at Fiesta City (DVD) – 2009Hundred Seventy Split\n\nThe World Won't Stop – 2011\nHundred Seventy Split – 2014\nPassage 3:\nJerry Garcia\nJerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 – August 9, 1995) was an American musician best known for being the principal songwriter, lead guitarist, and a vocalist with the rock band Grateful Dead, which he co-founded and which came to prominence during the counterculture of the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader of the band. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 as a member of the Grateful Dead.\nAs one of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for the band's entire 30-year career (1965–1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders–Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old & In the Way, the Garcia/Grisman and Garcia/Kahn acoustic duos, Legion of Mary, and New Riders of the Purple Sage (which he co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician. He was well known for his distinctive guitar playing, and was ranked 13th in Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" cover story in 2003.

It was written for Jerry Garcia's first solo album Garcia, which was released in January 1972. As with the songs on the rest of the album, Garcia plays every instrument himself except drums, played by Bill Kreutzmann, including acoustic guitar, bass guitar, and an electric guitar played through a Leslie speaker. Released as a single from the Garcia album, \"Sugaree\" peaked at #94 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1972 and was Garcia's only single ever on that chart.The song was first performed live by the Grateful Dead on July 31, 1971, at the Yale Bowl at Yale University, as was the song \"Mr. Charlie\". They played the song in numerous other concerts, including those later released as Dick's Picks Volume 3 and One from the Vault.\n\nPredecessors\nRusty York recorded a Marty Robbins-penned song in 1959 (Chess 1730) also called, \"Sugaree\".Elizabeth Cotten, a North Carolina folksinger, wrote and recorded a song called \"Shake Sugaree\" in 1966. The chorus of Cotten's song is \"Oh lordie me/Didn't I shake sugaree?\" Hunter was aware of this song when he wrote \"Sugaree.\"Fred Neil released a song in 1966 on his eponymous album called \"I've Got a Secret (Didn't We Shake Sugaree).\"\nIt can also be heard on \"Echoes of My Mind - The Best of Fred Neil 1963-1971\".\nIn 1970, singer-songwriter Keith Colley released the single \"Sugaree (Sugar Every Day And Night Girl)\" on the Challenge label.\n\nReferences in popular culture\nThe song is mentioned in Stephen King's 1981 novel Cujo.\nThe Persuasions included this song on their 2000 album of Grateful Dead covers, Might as Well… The Persuasions Sing Grateful Dead.Graham Parker covered the track on his 2004 album, Your Country.Nick Barker covered this song on his album Black Water Blues released in 2009.\nJackie Greene recorded a cover for his 2009 release The Grateful EP.\nOn the 2016 charity album Day of the Dead, \"Sugaree\" was covered by Jenny Lewis and the band Phosphorescent.\n\nSee also\nDark Star\nMusical improvisation\nPassage 7:\nSandy Rothman\nSandy Rothman (born January 30, 1946, Miami, Florida) is an American, San Francisco Bay Area bluegrass multi-instrumentalist and record producer.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMirtemir\nMirtemir Tursunov (Uzbek: Миртемир Турсунов) (May 30, 1910 - January 25, 1978) most commonly known simply as Mirtemir, was an Uzbek poet and literary translator. In addition to writing his own poetry, Mirtemir translated the works of many famous foreign poets, such as Abai Qunanbaiuli, Aleksandr Pushkin, Heinrich Heine, Magtymguly Pyragy, Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Lermontov, Nâzım Hikmet, Nikolay Nekrasov, Pablo Neruda, Samad Vurgun, and Shota Rustaveli into the Uzbek language.Mirtemir became a National Poet of the Uzbek SSR in 1971. He received many other awards for his works, including the State Berdaq Prize (1977) and the State Hamza Prize (1979). In 2002, Mirtemir was posthumously awarded the National Order of Merit (Uzbek: Buyuk xizmatlari uchun), one of independent Uzbekistan's most prestigious awards.\n\nLife and work\nMirtemir Umarbekovich Tursunov was born on May 30, 1910, in the village of Ikan, Turkistan. In 1932, Mirtemir graduated from the Pedagogical University of Samarkand with a degree in literature.\nMirtemir's first collection of poems, Shuʼlalar qoʻynida (Under the Lights) was published in 1928. His other collections of poetry include Zafar (Victory) (1929), Qaynashlarim (My Rages), Bong (The Clamor) (1932), and Poytaxt (The Capital) (1936).\nMirtemir translated the works of many famous foreign poets, such as Abai Qunanbaiuli, Aleksandr Pushkin, Berdaq, Heinrich Heine, Magtymguly Pyragy, Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Lermontov, Nâzım Hikmet, Nikolay Nekrasov, Pablo Neruda, Samad Vurgun, and Shota Rustaveli into Uzbek. In particular, he translated Who is Happy in Russia? of Nikolay Nekrasov and The Man in the Panther's Skin of Shota Rustaveli into Uzbek. He also translated the Kyrgyz epic poem Manas.\nAn example of his work, written originally in Cyrillic alphabet:\nThis is my mother tongue, the language of my dear mother. It permeated my soul and ear since I was in the cradle. This is the language of my people, my homeland, and my folks. In life time it is as old as mother earth.\nMirtemir died in Tashkent on 25 January 1978, at the age of 67.\nPassage 2:\nLavinia exilicauda\nThe hitch (Lavinia exilicauda) is a cyprinid fish endemic to central California, and was once very common. The common name may derive from a Pomoan word for this species. It is the only species in the monospecific genus Lavinia.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe hitch was first formally described in 1854 by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Frédéric Girard with its type locality given as the Sacramento River in California. While the hitch is closely related to the California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus), and the two species can hybridize, leading some authorities to place H. symmetricus in Lavinia, genomic data appear to support the fishes' separate lineages. The Lavinia genus has been placed in the subfamily Leuciscinae of the family Cyprinidae in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World. Other authorities classify the Leuciscidae as a family and place the genus Lavinia in the subfamily Laviniinae of that family.Three distinct population segments (DPS) or subspecies of the hitch are recognized:\n\nClear Lake hitch (chi in Pomoan language)\nMonterey hitch (Salinas hitch, Pajaro hitch)\nSacramento hitch (Central Valley hitch)These common names or DPS correspond to the subspecies Lavinia exilicauda chi Hopkirk, 1974, Lavinia exilicauda harengus Girard, 1856: 183–184  and Lavinia exilicauda exilicauda Baird and Girard in Girard, 1854,: 137  respectively.\n\nDescription\nThe hitch shape is deep and laterally compressed, with a small head, and a terminal mouth pointing upwards. They are generally silver all over; younger fish have a black spot at the base of the tail, losing it as they age, and becoming generally darker as well. The anal fin is noticeably longer than for other California minnows, with 11-14 rays, while the dorsal fin has 10-13 rays, and is placed further back, the base being positioned between pelvic and anal fins. The tail fin is large and deeply forked. They can get large for minnows, with lengths of up to 36 cm.  All of these features make them look much like the golden shiner. The hitch is closely related to the California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus complex), and these taxa can hybridize with each other.Hitch are omnivores of the open water, eating a combination of filamentous algae, insects, and zooplankton. They can be found in lakes, sloughs, and slow-moving sections of rivers and streams. With the highest temperature tolerance among the native fish of the Central Valley, they can be found in both warm and cool water; they also have considerable salt tolerance, for instance occurring in Suisun Marsh (7-8 ppt salinity), and Salinas River lagoon (9 ppt).\n\nDistribution\nTheir range includes the Sacramento River-San Joaquin River System of the Central Valley, the Russian River, Clear Lake, Pajaro River, and Salinas River. Although once abundant, but no longer commercially fished in Clear Lake, populations have been declining. The most likely cause appears to be loss of springtime spawning water flows due to water diversion and damming.\n\nConservation\nThe Clear Lake hitch was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 2014.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nUEA Creative Writing Course\nThe University of East Anglia's Creative Writing Course was founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970.

He was the grandfather of the Turkish statesman Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and the great-grandfather of famous poets Nâzım Hikmet and Oktay Rıfat Horozcu and the socialist activist, lawyer, and athlete Mehmet Ali Aybar.\n\nBiography\nMehmed Ali was born as Ludwig Karl Friedrich Detroit (also known as Carl Detroy) in Magdeburg, Prussia. His parents were Carl Friedrich Detroit and Henriette Jeanette Severin. The French family name points to Huguenot ancestry, as a descendant of Protestant refugees from France in the 16th or 17th century. During his teenage years in 1843 he ran away to sea, and traveled to the Ottoman Empire, where he converted to Islam and was circumcised. There, in 1846, Âli Pasha, later Grand Vizier, sent him to a military school. He received a commission in the Ottoman Army in 1853 and fought against Russia in the Crimean War. He was made a brigadier general and Pasha in 1865.\n\nIn the 1877–1878 war against Russia, Mehmed Ali led the Turkish army in Bulgaria. He was successful in his operations on the Lom river (August–September 1877), but was afterward forced back by his opponents. He failed to effect a junction with Süleyman Hüsnü Pasha, and was superseded by the latter. Later in 1878 he was a participant at the Congress of Berlin.\n\nDeath\nIn August 1878, the Ottoman government selected him to overview the process of the cession of the Plav-Gucia region to Montenegro in compliance to the decisions of the Congress of Berlin. Mehmed Ali Pasha's first task was the pacification of the Albanian League of Prizren, which opposed the border change as part of the areas (Plav-Gucia/Plav-Gusinje) were inhabited by ethnic Albanians. He arrived in Kosovo in late August, attempting to make local Albanians comply with the Berlin Treaty but was blocked from any further movement towards the Ottoman-Montenegrin border by the local committees of the Albanian League. Stationed in Abdullah Pasha Dreni's estate in Gjakova with several Ottoman battalions he was killed on September 6 after a seven-day battle with several thousand Albanians opposing cession of Albanian inhabited lands to European powers.\n\nSources\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

She competed in the women's duet competition with her twin sister, Isabela Moraes, at both the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. Both also competed for Ohio State University, winning 11 national championships, including the team routine title in 2000, and four straight titles in duet and trio routines between 1999 and 2002.

Both have been  part of the cast of Le Rêve, a show presented in Las Vegas since 2007, though Carolina is less frequent as she travels with her husband, part of Cirque du Soleil's technical team.\nPassage 2:\nIsabela Moraes\nIsabela Moraes (born 5 April 1980) is a former synchronized swimmer from Brazil. She competed in the women's duet competition with her twin sister, Carolina Moraes, at both the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.  Both also competed for Ohio State University, winning 11 national championships, including the team routine title in 2000, and four straight titles in duet and trio routines between 1999 and 2002. Following the Olympics, Carolina and Isabela retired and joined Cirque du Soleil, with their first performance being as part of the 2005 World Aquatics Championships opening ceremony. Isabela has been since 2007 part of Le Rêve, a show presented in Las Vegas.\nPassage 3:\nZumanity\nZumanity (zoo-manity)  was a resident cabaret-style show by Cirque du Soleil at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, placed into the theatre previously occupied by Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance (musical). The production was unveiled on September 20, 2003 (previews started on August 14, 2003) and had its last performance on March 14, 2020. It was announced on November 16, 2020 that the show would be closing permanently. It is the first \"adult-themed\" Cirque du Soleil show, billed as \"the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil\" or \"another side of Cirque du Soleil\". Created by René Richard Cyr and Dominic Champagne, Zumanity is a departure from the standard Cirque format. Intended to be for mature adult audiences only, this show is centered on erotic song, dance, acrobatics, and comedy.The inspiration to create Zumanity  came from multiple sources. Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté had been offered the chance to create two new shows in Las Vegas, and wanted something completely new and original rather than multiple similar shows that would cannibalize off of each other's sales and audiences. Another reason was that the New York-New York Hotel and Casino wanted to make their entertainment appear more \"trendy.\" The hotel liked the concept of a more adult Cirque du Soleil performance.Laliberté admits that the biggest reason to produce this show was the chance to create something with riskier subject matter. He was interested in the idea of creating a show that explored human sexuality, something that was at complete odds with the other, more family-oriented Cirque du Soleil shows. \"Our previous shows have all been family-oriented and politically correct, which is great,\" Laliberté said, \"but we're human beings, we won't hide it. We're a bunch of happy campers. We like to live new experiences. Zumanity deals with some of those experiences.\"On February 22, 2022, Cirque du Soleil announced that a new show, \"Mad Apple,\" would replace the Zumanity show at New York-New York Hotel and Casino, which opened on May 26, 2022.\n\nCostumes\nThierry Mugler designed the costumes for Zumanity; he created the costumes to enhance the sensual atmosphere and heightened sexuality of the production.  Many of the costumes are highly colorful, yet some are minimal to an exaggerated extreme. Fur, feathers, leather, lace, fishnet stockings, velvet dresses, tiny corsets, cone bras, and plastic accessories were primary materials utilized to create the costumes' provocative appeal. Jonel's costume, for example, is made of stretch vinyl and is airbrushed to create a semi-nude effect; her bright red wig is made of expanded foam. Faun has fur on his pants which is made from toothbrush bristles, human hair, and yak fur. Molinier's long velvet dress was created by using a stencil and net onto which black silicone was applied. Though some characters are made to look entirely nude, the sex organs are fake pieces. Zumanity had Cirque's most expensive and elaborate costumes, the Rose Boy's g-string alone costing $75,000.\nFor a great selection of character costumes and concept art, see Le Grand Chapiteau - Zumanity - Personages\n\nThe Human Zoo\nThe lobby was created in European style, with an emphasis on curves. A long lighting fixture on the ceiling looked to be made of many strips of golden silk. One of the walls was lined with what looked to be a burgundy, padded headboard. Along the headboard, there were peepholes that originally were conceived to show clips of erotic, vintage films, but eventually showed promotional posters of the show. There was a large window filled with blue swirls, and a glowing, golden fixture in the wall that seemed to resemble a labia. Another window with a frame that looked like branches or vines showcased the \"Amsterdam Room,\" which had one of the performers in it, dancing and teasing the guests in the lobby. You could talk to the performer through a phone built into the wall. The lamps were elegant and attached to the wall by arms that looked porous. There was a small nook with a couch you could lay on, usually with one of the performers. The grand staircase leading to the balconies also looked to be made of vines, or even nerves possibly symbolizing the sense of touch.\nThe theatre had 3 bars, the Eroticafés: two on the ground floor and one upstairs. They served sushi and various drinks, the highlight being the Zumanitini. The Zumanitini was 1 oz. Vodka Citron, 1/2 oz. Cherry Pucker, and a splash of Triple Sec, Sweet and Sour, and cranberry. Next to one of the bars was a small stage that looked like someone's bedroom. You would always find one of the cast members beckoning to the guests from the bed. The restrooms were unique in that you would hear whispering and teasing at each station.

The documentary was filmed in the O theatre and by the Colorado River.  The film shows certain artists performing out around the river as well as on stage and provides information on the necessary technical equipment used to produce the performance.  Bonus features of Flow include: performance clips, Russian swing act, technical information and film below the surface of the O pool, and information about the creation of O itself.In 2009, Flow won the Prix Italia award for the category of Creativity in High Definition.The following acts were used in Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away:\n\nSynchronised swimming\nBateau\nFire\nDuo trapeze\nContortion\nAerial hoops\nPassage 6:\nLe Rêve (show)\nLe Rêve (\"The Dream\") was a stage production in residence at the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort. It was the only Las Vegas show set in an aquatic theater-in-the-round stage (>1 million US gallon (water capacity). The show featured diving and feats of strength with special effects, including fire effects. No seat is more than 40 feet (12 m) from the stage.  The production was originally created by Franco Dragone but has been substantially revised over time. The show featured more than 90 performers and 250 cast and crew members.Each member of the cast must become SCUBA-certified before performing in the theater. In January 2018, Le Rêve completed a two-year reimagination of the production. The show now features all-new costumes designed by Suzy Benzinger, choreography by Marguerite Derricks, music by Benoit Jutras and lighting design by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer. In April 2019, the show was voted “Best Production Show” by the Southern Nevada Hotel Concierge Association for the ninth consecutive year.\n\nShow\nWhile the show is continually revised over time, the central theme includes a female lead who see-saws back and forth between her dueling desires for love and passion, mind or body, as she finds herself attracted to two men. Put into a dream world to help her decide between the two suitors, she embarks on a mystical journey. The show concludes with what the production calls \"a graceful and inspirational scene.\"The show includes dancing, swimming, gymnastics, diving and stunt performances, aerial performance and trained dove flights. During the production run, two of the athletes playing romantic leads fell in love themselves. Olympic athletes and notable gymnasts have joined the cast over the years.\n\nHistory\nThe show had its world premiere on May 6, 2005.All rights to the show are owned by Wynn Las Vegas, so the resort is able to adapt the show at will. Le Rêve celebrated its 3,000th performance in January 2012.  The show celebrated its 12th anniversary in the summer of 2017 and has performed approximately 5,700 shows. Le Rêve celebrated its 6,000th performance in May 2018.\nThe House of Dancing Water, has some similarities to Le Rêve and O by Cirque du Soleil.The cast and crew of “Le Reve,” the signature production at Wynn Las Vegas since the hotel opened in 2005, were placed on furlough May 28, 2020. The first large-scale Las Vegas production show to permanently close due to the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most acclaimed performances to ever hit the Strip. Wynn Las Vegas confirmed “Le Rêve” has shuttered for good after more than 6,000 shows over the last 15 years.\n\nHonors and awards\nMedia history\nSix performers from Le Rêve were the models for the season finale of Face Off, aired on SyFy on March 26, 2013.  They also performed an act in the make-up, complete with full immersion and dives into the water.\nLe Rêve was featured on an episode of the Fine Living series What Makes it Tick, produced by NorthSouth Productions.\nCast members from the show performed on a results episode of NBC's summer hit America's Got Talent in 2010.\nCast members were also featured in the music video for the single \"Only the Young\", by Brandon Flowers.\n32 performers from Le Rêve staged a \"surreal, elaborate montage of scenes\" from the show as part of the 2010 Latin Grammys at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The event was broadcast live on Univision.\nCast members and the show were featured on the first episode of Somebody's Gotta Do It with Mike Rowe on CNN.\n\nTheater and Facilities\nThe show take places in a unique aquatic theater-in-the-round. The swimming pool has a capacity of more than 1 million US gallons with its deepest point at 27 feet. Performers climb to heights of more than 80 feet above the water before diving straight down. Public estimates of the cost of the theater itself were up to $75 million for the original construction, not including later renovations such as 180-speaker surround sound.Two significant curtain effects have been used, including a 24-panel canopy that takes more than an hour to reset for the next show.In 2008, a VIP seating area was added to the theater.  In 2015, an additional 172 fountains, 120 LED lighting fixtures, and 16 fire-shooting devices were added by WET Design.  Current capacity is 1,600 per show, not including an underwater SCUBA viewing area that is sometimes available for VIP guests.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

He served as the head football coach at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio from 1996 to 2021, compiling a record of 224–51. Fincham played football at Ohio University from 1983 to 1986. On September 25, 2010, Fincham won his 130th game, passing Dave Maurer for the most wins in Wittenberg Tigers football history.\n\nHead coaching record\nSee also\nList of college football coaches with 200 wins\nPassage 2:\nJames C. Donnelly\nJames Corcoran Donnelly (December 9, 1881 – March 24, 1952) was an American college football player and coach in the early 1900s. He played football at Worcester's Classical High School then went on to Dartmouth where he played football. After graduation in 1905 he went to Harvard Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1908. He practiced law and served as head football coach at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1909, 1911, 1915), Howard College in Birmingham, Alabama (1910), and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (1912–1914), compiling a career college football record of 22–32–4. In 1931, he was appointed a Superior Court judge. His younger brother, Charley Donnelly also coached football at the high school and college level. His youngest brother, Ralph E. Donnelly, was also a standout football player and war hero.\n\nEarly life\nDonnelly was born on December 9, 1881 in Clinton, Massachusetts. Donnelly was the oldest of seven children born to John E. Donnelly and Mary Ellen Corcoran Donnelly. His father immigrated from England and was a machinist in Clinton. James graduated from Classical High School in Worcester, where he had starred in football.\n\nCollege career\nHe attended Dartmouth College where he graduated with an A.B. in 1905. He excelled in football where he played end on the first Dartmouth football team to beat Harvard. In 1904, his final year, he lettered under coach Fred Folsom. That year, he helped the Dartmouth eleven to an undefeated record of 9–0–1 with a scoreless tie to national power Harvard. Donnelly played alongside three Walter Camp All-Americans, Joseph Gilman at guard (2nd team), Ralph Glaze at end (3rd team) and James Vaughn at halfback (3rd team). The team out scored its opponents by a combined score of 143 to 13. After graduating from Dartmouth, Donnelly attended Harvard Law School and graduated in 1907.\n\nLegal career\nAfter graduating from Harvard, he was admitted to the bar in 1908 and became a lawyer in Worcester, Massachusetts. Early in his career, he clerked in the law office of Thayer & Cobb, where he worked with Webster Thayer, later the judge in the Sacco and Vanzetti Trial. In 1908, he became law partners with Charles F. Campbell. In 1931, he was appointed as a judge in the Superior Court in Worcester by Governor Joseph B. Ely. His appointment was aided partly by the political connections of his family and his law partner but was hailed by the legal community because he was known for his consistency and fairness.\n\nCoaching career\nIn the fall of 1905 he began coaching local high schools and colleges in the area. During the period from 1905 to 1909 he was the football coach of one or two teams per season including at Worcester High School, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Highland Military Academy of Worcester. In 1910 he took the head football job at Howard College (now known as Samford University) in Birmingham, Alabama. His team finished the season with a 1–8 record and was outscored 304 to 10. In 1911 he returned to coach at Worcester Polytechnic Institute until he was hired for the 1912 football season as an acting professor of physical education and football coach at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In the three years as head coach at Miami he had a combined record 14–8–2. Donnelly was replaced as head football coach for the 1915 season by Chester J. Roberts. At the time Miami was changing their philosophy of athletics by moving to an all-year athletic coach. Donnelly was unable to be in Oxford for the entire school year since he could only take a limited amount of time off from his law practice in Massachusetts.\n\nPersonal life\nDonnelly married Mary O'Reilly of Worcester on October 21, 1920. They had three children: James, Jr., Rosemary, and Elizabeth Ann. Donnelly was killed in a traffic accident in Ashland, Virginia on the way back from Florida, on March 24, 1952. His car was hit head on by a truck. His wife and his daughter, Rosemary were also in the car at the time of the accident, with Rosemary also being killed.\n\nHead coaching record\nCollege football\nPassage 3:\nJoe Simmons (coach)\nJoseph F. Simmons (June 5, 1895 – March 4, 1973) was an American football, basketball, and baseball coach.  He served as the head football coach at Central Michigan University for one season in 1920, compiling a record of 4–3–1.  He was also the head basketball and head baseball coach at Central Michigan during the same academic year.  Simmons graduated from Carthage College, where played football, basketball, and baseball, and ran track.  He coached high school football at South Milwaukee High School in the late 1920s and at Milwaukee Country Day School from 1928 to 1936.  He was an assistant football coach at Yale University from 1937 to 1939.\n\nHead coaching record\nCollege football\nPassage 4:\nJoe Odom\nJoseph Edward Odom (born December 14, 1979) is a former National Football League (NFL) linebacker.  He was selected in the sixth round of the 2003 NFL Draft with the 191st overall pick by the Chicago Bears out of Purdue University. On August 23, 2006, Odom was claimed off of waivers by the Buffalo Bills. After suffering a career ending knee injury, he was forced to medically retire after the 2006 season. Joe currently works for the Stephen Gould Corporation out of Tampa, FL. He is married to Aline Odom from Brazil and has three daughters: Stella Odom, Luna Odom, and Beatriz Odom. They currently live on a small farm in Myakka City, FL.\nPassage 5:\nSammy Joe Odom\nSammy JoeHis career has spanned the tenure of baseball commissioners Bowie Kuhn, Peter Ueberroth, Bart Giamatti, Fay Vincent, Bud Selig, and Rob Manfred. The 2015 season was West's 38th in MLB, making him MLB's most senior umpire. Umpire Bruce Froemming, who was previously the most senior umpire, spent 37 seasons in MLB, retiring at the end of the 2007 season.On August 9, 2017, West was suspended for three games after making inappropriate comments about Adrián Beltré. Beltre defended West, stating that he thought the suspension was unnecessary and that West had made the comments in jest.In the bottom of the first inning of Game 4 of the 2018 ALCS, a deep drive and potential two-run homer to right field by Houston's José Altuve, which Boston's Mookie Betts nearly caught with a leaping grab at the wall, was ruled by West to be an out due to fan interference. West, the crew chief for the series, made the call from his right field position; the call stood after review by video replay. The call was widely discussed in coverage of the game and on social media such as Twitter.On August 14, 2019, West umpired his 5,164th Major League Baseball game to move past Bruce Froemming for the second-most number of major league games officiated. Only Bill Klem, who umpired from 1905 to 1941, had called more games than West.On October 22, 2019, West filed a defamation lawsuit in New York against Paul Lo Duca and Action Network over comments that the former New York Mets catcher made on a podcast in April 2019. On the podcast, Lo Duca recalled his teammate Billy Wagner telling him in 2006–2007, \"Joe loves antique cars so every time he comes into town I lend him my '57 Chevy so he can drive it around so then he opens up the strike zone for me.\" In the complaint, West denied this and said he suffered unspecified damages as a result of Lo Duca's comments. West was later awarded $500,000 in damages.On July 30, 2020, while umpiring the Washington Nationals–Toronto Blue Jays game, West was hit on the side of the head when Bo Bichette lost his bat. He left the game in the bottom of the first inning but returned in the top of the third as the third base umpire.On May 25, 2021, West surpassed Bill Klem's major league record by umpiring his 5,376th career game, in a contest between the White Sox and Cardinals at Guaranteed Rate Field. West announced he would retire after the 2021 postseason; his final assignment was the 2021 National League Wild Card Game, where he was the home plate umpire.On February 4, 2022, West officially retired.\n\nReception\nWest has been mentioned in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify the best and worst umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst umpire, 6 percent of players in the survey selected West, ranking him fourth. A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West \"had the fewest number of extra balls and strikes,\" which the outlet asserted \"is a sign of consistency.\"In a 2010 poll of 100 players, West ranked as the second-worst umpire in the league. In a 2011 players poll, 41 percent of players polled (the \"overwhelming\" plurality) named West the worst umpire; only 5 percent of players polled named him as best.In a 2019 study by Boston University's Mark T. Williams, West was identified as the umpire during the 2018 season with the second-highest percentage of bad ball-and-strike calls when working behind home plate. Over West's last eleven years, he has averaged 21 incorrect calls a game, or 2.3 per inning.\n\nOutside baseball\nWest is known outside umpiring as a singer-songwriter. His involvement in country music and his demeanor on the field have earned him the nickname \"Cowboy Joe\". West has described his music as \"two chords and the truth. ... It's simple. It tells a story.\" In 2009, West said of his musical pursuits, \"I was lucky. You know, the dues you have to pay to get here as an umpire are long and tedious, but the music business, because I was already in the major leagues, kind of opened a lot of doors I normally wouldn't have been able to open.\"West has appeared at the Grand Ole Opry. He has performed with Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee, and Merle Haggard. West served as a pallbearer for Boxcar Willie.West released his first album, Blue Cowboy, in 1987. Blue Cowboy is an album of three original songs and five covers. Chuck Yarborough of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, \"Listening to the first excerpt of his \"Blue Cowboy\" made me balk—you'll pardon the expression—at listening to the second. But I did. And the third. And so on. And now? Well, if I'm Nashville, I run West outta the game.\" In a September 2012 review, music blog Long After Dark said, \"Blue Cowboy easily ranks with Ron Artest and Carl Lewis as one of the worst albums that a sports figure has cut ... ever. I can say that I managed to make it through the record, although it was not easy.\"He released Diamond Dreams in 2008. The album was a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, \"As I look back on how this CD came together, I realize that I am a musician and Joe is an umpire. But his love for music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project.\" Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was \"a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West\".West has made one film appearance, playing a third base umpire in the 1988 comedy film The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! He also made a cameo appearance on the television crime drama The Oldest Rookie. An avid golfer, West appears on the Celebrity Players Tour.\n\nPersonal life\nWest has been married twice. After the death of his first wife, West remarried.In 2012, West was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, which is now in remission.\n\nSee also\nList of Major League Baseball umpires\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPhilip Carlo\nPhilip Carlo (April 18, 1949 – November 8, 2010) was an American journalist and best selling biographer of Thomas Pitera, Richard Kuklinski, Anthony Casso, and Richard Ramirez. Carlo had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as \"Lou Gehrig's Disease\".\nHe was diagnosed in 2005 and reliant on a wheelchair with respirator, but retained his ability to speak and continued to write until his death. He died of the disease on November 8, 2010, at age 61.\n\nEarly life\nPhilip Carlo was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York. From an early age, he was involved in gang activity. Raised on the streets of Brooklyn, New York. In 1964 when Carlo was 15 years old, he witnessed a close friend shot to death in broad daylight by hit men from the Colombo crime family. Moving toward induction into an organized crime mob family, Carlo found himself in trouble with the law. At the age of 17, he was involved in a gang fight and shot in the forehead by a .22 caliber gun.\n\nCareer\nCarlo's passion for books ultimately steered him from the criminal path. The works of John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and Charles Dickens, among others, helped Carlo out of Brooklyn. At 19, he moved to Manhattan and secured a job as a real estate agent on the Upper West Side, Manhattan. Although successful, Carlo walked away from the business after nine years with the goal of ultimately becoming a professional writer. Despite his illness, in early November 2009, Carlo was able to appear on Shovio's Talk Back TV, to take questions about his research.Carlo's first book was about a killer in a hospital ward. He got the idea while hospitalized at Bellevue and a woman was murdered there. The book received 125 rejection letters and was never published. His second book was about an American child kidnapped and forced into the sex trade. He got the idea while visiting Amsterdam. Carlo was shocked to see children performing sex shows in shop windows. Dutton published it as Stolen Flower in 1986. Universal Pictures optioned the book for Robert De Niro.His last three books were written with the help of Kelsey Osgood, a Columbia University graduate from Brooklyn, who took notes for him due to his ALS. His last book, The Killer Within: In the Company of Monsters (which deals with his battle against ALS), was released posthumously in January 2011.\n\nPersonal life\nPhilip Carlo married Laura Garofalo in December 2009. The two met in August 2006 after Carlo mentioned that one of his childhood friends, Manny Garofalo, had a brother, Eddie, who had been killed on orders of the Gambino underboss Salvatore Gravano, known as Sammy the Bull. Carlo and Manny reunited, along with Manny's niece, Eddie's daughter, Laura Garofalo.\n\nWorks\nNon-fiction\n\nThe Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez (The True Story of America's Most Feared Serial Killer), Kensington (1996) ISBN 1-57566-030-X\nThe Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer, St. Martin's Press (2006) ISBN 0-312-34928-9\nGaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss, William Morrow Press (2008) ISBN 978-0-06-142984-2\nThe Butcher: Anatomy of a Mafia Psychopath, William Morrow Press (2009) ISBN 978-0-06-174465-5\nThe Killer Within: In the Company of Monsters, Overlook Press (2011) ISBN 978-1-59020-431-3Novels\n\nStolen Flower.

Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Francis Bacon, Locke is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American Revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. Internationally, Locke's political-legal principles continue to have a profound influence on the theory and practice of limited representative government and the protection of basic rights and freedoms under the rule of law.Locke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.\nHe postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate, or tabula rasa. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception, a concept now known as empiricism.\n\nEarly life\nLocke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched cottage by the church in Wrington, Somerset, about 12 miles from Bristol. He was baptised the same day, as both of his parents were Puritans. Locke's father, also called John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in Chew Magna and as a captain of cavalry for the Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the English Civil War. His mother was Agnes Keene. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the market town of Pensford, about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural Tudor house in Belluton.\nIn 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London under the sponsorship of Alexander Popham, a member of Parliament and John Sr.'s former commander. At the age of 16 he was at school just half a mile away from the execution of Charles I; however, the boys were not allowed to go and watch. After completing studies at Westminster, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in the autumn of 1652 at the age of 20. The dean of the college at the timeand called the results \"spectacular\". He reported that in 1971 there were less than 300 people in the United Kingdom over 100 years of age, and that this number had risen to 1800 total people of the same age range by 1981. Thatcher served as director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys until 1986.\n\nPopulation research\nHe subsequently was drawn into researching discrepancies between the 1981 census and a prior version completed in 1971, specifically on data involving centenarians. During the course of this research, he found that there was a lack of study regarding the well-being of centenarians in the United Kingdom. Thatcher posited that the increase in longevity amongst those individuals that actually get to one-hundred was likely attributable to lack of stress in these older years. Thatcher found that contributing factors towards this progress in longevity also included better overall healthcare and an ever-increasing total population size in general. According to his research, Thatcher predicted that in the decade of the 2080s, each year the United Kingdom would see one individual reach the age of 116. He asserted that a fair number of individuals born between the 1950s–1960s attributed to the post–World War II baby boom would see a life expectancy age range between 116–123 total years.In addition to his roles within government Thatcher contributed to the field of statistics through writings collaborated upon with other academics. His 1983 article \"How Many People Have Ever Lived On Earth?\", a publication of the International Statistical Institute, disproved the notion that the number of people living in the 20th century was in actuality much less than the total number of individuals previously in existence. His work on the Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality is held by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and regarded as one of its most vital collections. The database contains information from over 30 sovereign states on mortality and population size for males and females older than the age of 80. Their research was entered into computer format by the medical school at Odense University in the early part of the 1990s. Academic scholars James Vaupel and Väinö Kannisto helped him co-author the book The Force of Mortality at Ages 80 to 120, which was first published in 1998. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 2000, Douglas Liddell placed Thatcher amongst \"stalwarts\" within the field of statistics, and compared him to others influential within the field including fellow statistician Michael Healy.\n\nDeath\nThatcher remained active within the field of statistics throughout his old age, communicating with academics in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Until the day he died, he was enthusiastically involved in research within the field of demographics. He died at the age of 83 on 13 February 2010.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nTasmania First Party\nThe Tasmania First Party is a minor Australian political party which operates exclusively in the state of Tasmania. The party was begun by members of the Tasmanian Firearms Owners Association in response to the Howard government's 1996 National Firearms Agreement, which the party called a \"unilateral imposition of unnecessarily restrictive firearm legislation, following the unique tragedy of Martin Bryant's Port Arthur protest[sic].\"Tasmania First contested its first election in August 1998, the Tasmanian state election. The party received 5.1% of the primary vote for the House of Assembly but failed to win any seats. Tasmania First subsequently contested the Australian federal elections in 1998 and 2001, as well as Tasmanian state elections in 2002 and 2006, but its primary vote in these elections was very modest compared to the party's initial effort in 1998. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) deregistered Tasmania First as a registered political party  on 28 April 2006, because the party had not contested a federal election in over four years(an AEC requirement, which must be met if parties are to retain their registration at the national level).\nIn August 1998, The Examiner of Launceston referred to Tasmania First as \"a sort of local mirror image of One Nation\". Tasmania First called this \"defamatory\" and demanded a retraction, threatening legal proceedings against the newspaper.In 2001 the party declared itself \"a natural partner to Brian Harradine in the Senate, where we have many policies in common, being a State based party with the interests of Tasmania our first priority.\"Tasmania First fielded four candidates in the 2006 Tasmanian state election; one in Bass, one in Lyons, and two in Denison.Note: The party should not be confused with the First Party of Tasmania, a minor political organisation whose policies include the secession of Tasmania from Australia.\n\nSee also\nList of political parties in Australia\nJacqui Lambie Network\nPassage 2:\nMartin Bryant\nMartin John Bryant (born 7 May 1967) is a convicted Australian mass shooter who murdered 35 people and injured 23 others in the Port Arthur massacre, one of the world's deadliest shooting sprees, in Port Arthur, Tasmania, between 28 and 29 April 1996. He is serving 35 life sentences plus 1,652 years at Risdon Prison in Hobart. His papers are marked Never to be released.\n\nEarly life\nMartin Bryant was born on 7 May 1967 at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Hobart, Tasmania. He was the first child of Maurice and Carleen Bryant. Although the family home was in Lenah Valley, Bryant spent some of his childhood at their beach home in Carnarvon Bay. In a 2011 interview, his mother recalled that while Bryant was very young, she would often find his toys broken and that he was an \"annoying\" and \"different\" child. A psychologist's view was that Bryant would never be capable of holding down a job as he would aggravate people to such an extent that he would always be in trouble.Locals recall abnormal behaviour by Bryant, such as pulling the snorkel from another boy while diving and cutting down trees on a neighbour's property. He was described by teachers as being distant from reality and unemotional. At school, Bryant was a disruptive and sometimes violent child who suffered severe bullying by other children. After he was suspended from New Town Primary School in 1977, psychological assessments noted that he tortured animals. Bryant returned to school the following year with improved behaviour; however, he persisted in teasing younger children. He was transferred to a special education unit at New Town High School in 1980, where he deteriorated both academically and behaviourally throughout his remaining school years.\n\nPsychological and psychiatric assessments\nDescriptions of Bryant's behaviour as an adolescent show that he continued to be disturbed and outlined the possibility of an intellectual disability. When leaving school in 1983, he was assessed for a disability pension by a psychiatrist who wrote: \"Cannot read or write. Does a bit of gardening and watches TV ... Only his parents' efforts prevent further deterioration. Could be schizophrenic and parents face a bleak future with him.\" Bryant received a disability pension, though he also worked as a handyman and gardener. In an examination after the massacre, forensic psychiatrist Ian Joblin found Bryant to be borderline mentally disabled with an I.Q. of 66, equivalent to an 11-year-old.While awaiting trial, Bryant was examined by court-appointed psychiatrist Ian Sale, who was of the opinion that Bryant \"could be regarded as having shown a mixture of conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity and a condition known as Asperger syndrome\". Psychiatrist Paul Mullen, hired at the request of Bryant's legal counsel, found that Bryant was socially and intellectually impaired. Furthermore, finding that he did not display signs of schizophrenia or a mood disorder, Mullen concluded, \"Though Mr. Bryant was clearly a distressed and disturbed young man, he was not mentally ill.\"\n\nAdulthood\nIn early 1987, when Bryant was 19, he met 54-year-old Helen Mary Elizabeth Harvey, heiress to a share in the Tattersall's lottery fortune, while looking for new customers for his lawnmowing service. Harvey, who lived with her mother Hilza, befriended Bryant, who became a regular visitor to her neglected mansion in New Town and assisted with tasks such as feeding the fourteen dogs living inside the house and the forty cats living inside her garage. In June 1990, an anonymous person reported Harvey to the health authorities and medics found both Harvey and her mother in need of urgent hospital treatment. With Helen suffering from infected ulcers and Hilza with an untreated broken hip, Hilza Harvey was moved into a nursing home and died several weeks later at the age of 79.A cleanup order was placed on the decaying mansion and Bryant's father took long-service leave to assist in cleaning the interior. The local RSPCA unit had to confiscate many animals living in the house. Following the mandatory cleanup, Harvey now invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion and they began spending extravagant amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The odd pair of friends began to spend most days shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant. Around this time, Bryant was reassessed for his pension and a note was attached to the paperwork: \"Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ... Martin tells me he would like to go around shooting people. It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents' control\".In 1991, as a result of no longer being allowed to have animals at the house, Harvey and Bryant moved together onto a 20,000 figure became the orthodox figure in Chinese communist sources.Creelman asserted up to 60,000 were killed, with only 36 spared, and even some late-20th century Japanese sources repeat the figure of 60,000. Stewart Lone discredited Creelman's claim, citing \"the entire city population was not massacred, however, is suggested by the speed with which Port Arthur's streets again filled after the Japanese occupation: had the civilian population been literally decimated or destroyed, it is unlikely that others would have ventured to trade and work under Japanese occupation.\"\n\nAftermath\nThe string of Japanese victories at Pyongyang and then at the Battle of the Yalu River had increased what had until then been only lukewarm Western interest in the war. By the time of the assault on Port Arthur, a number of Western reporters were attached to the Japanese Second Army. Western reporting on the massacre was controversial.  Most correspondents such as James Creelman, writing for the New York World, and Frederic Villiers, a writer and illustrator for the London Black and White, described a wide scale and cold-blooded massacre, while Amédée Baillot de Guerville alleged in the pages of the New York Herald that no such massacre had occurred. Writing a decade later, de Guerville amended this view, claiming that though some 120 civilians were killed it still had not been a massacre.\nForeign reporters had to wait until they had left the area before they could file their stories, which the Japanese censors would otherwise have suppressed.  At first, the incident garnered little attention: a one-sentence report in The Times on 26 November stated: \"Great slaughter is reported to have taken place.\"\nThe American [sic] James Creelman was the first to report on the massacre in a front-page article that declared:\nThe Japanese troops entered Port Arthur on Nov. 21 and massacred practically the entire population in cold blood. ... The defenseless and unarmed inhabitants were butchered in their houses and their bodies were unspeakably mutilated. There was an unrestrained reign of murder which continued for three days. The whole town was plundered with appalling atrocities. ... It was the first stain upon Japanese civilization. The Japanese in this instance relapsed into barbarism.\nOther newspapers soon followed with detailed reports.  The reports hurt Japan's international image and threatened the progress of negotiations with the United States to bring an end to the unequal treaties Japan had been made to sign in the 1850s.  Japanese Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu announced an investigation, publishing these intentions in the New York World, and promised not to interfere with foreign correspondents.  On 16 December, the Foreign Ministry released a statement to the press, asserting the atrocities were exaggerations:\nThe Japanese Government desires no concealment of the events at Port Arthur.  On the contrary, it is investigating rigidly for the purpose of fixing the exact responsibility and is taking measures essential to the reputation of the empire. ... Japanese troops transported with rage at the mutilation of their comrades by the enemy, broke through all restraints ... [and] exasperated by the wholesale attempts [by Chinese soldiers] at escape disguised at citizens, they inflicted vengeance without discrimination. ... the victims, almost without exception, were soldiers wearing the stolen clothes of citizens.\nThe Japanese press generally avoided reporting on the massacre, or dismissed it, as when the Jiyū Shinbun called allegations \"an invidious desire to detract from the glory of the Japanese Army\".   The Shin Chōya accused Westerners of exaggerating the extent of the atrocities, and of hypocrisy in light of the atrocities they had committed throughout the East, stating that \"the history of savage nations that have come in contact with Christian Occidentals is all but written in blood\".  Some questioned Creelman's reliability, and a rumour spread that he left for Shanghai after the fall of Port Arthur to work for the Chinese government.   The Japan Weekly Mail, on the other hand, castigated the Japanese army in several articles.  Attempts to launch an inquiry met resistance from those who wanted it covered up.  The inquiry resulted in no punishments given out.Domestic instability kept the Chinese government under pressure to conceal the defeat, rather than castigate the Japanese for the atrocities.  The China Gazette reported on the attempted cover-up: \"Telegraphic notices have been sent ... all over the empire by the officials saying that a wicked report has been set on foot by the enemy that they have captured Port Arthur, but it was utterly untrue, the place being garrisoned by 30,000 brave Chinese soldiers who would never give it up to the Japanese.\"  As late as a month later, the China Gazette reported the defeat remained unknown even to many government officials.  The pro-Japanese North-China Herald attempted to defend the perpetrators of the massacre by proposing \"The circumstances were such as might have taxed the control of any invading force.\"The incident strained the delicate foreign relations Japan had been dealing with.  The war itself hurt Japan's relations with Britain, and threatened to hurt Japan's renegotiation of treaties with the US.  The incident coloured Western perceptions of Japan as barbarians under a thin veil of civilization.  These perceptions contributed to anti-Japanese sentiments in North America in the early 20th century, which would continue through World War II.\n\nSee also\nList of massacres in China\n\nNotes\nWorks cited\nFurther sources\nAllan, James.

Desclos stated she wrote the novel as a series of love letters to her lover Jean Paulhan, who had admired the work of the Marquis de Sade. The novel shares with the latter themes such as love, dominance, and submission.\n\nPlot\nStory of O is a tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse, offering herself to any male who belongs to the same secret society as her lover. She is regularly stripped, blindfolded, chained, and whipped; her anus is widened by increasingly large plugs; her labium is pierced and her buttocks are branded.\nThe story begins when O's lover, René, brings her to the château in Roissy, where she is trained to serve the members of an elite club. After this initial training, as a demonstration of their bond and his generosity, René hands O to his elder stepbrother Sir Stephen, a more severe master. René wants O to learn to serve someone whom she does not love, and someone who does not love her. Over the course of this training, O falls in love with Sir Stephen and believes him to be in love with her as well. During the summer, Sir Stephen sends O to an old mansion in Samois solely inhabited by women for advanced training and body modifications related to submission. There she agrees to receive permanent marks of Sir Stephen's ownership, in the form of a brand and a steel tag hanging from a labia piercing.\nMeanwhile René has encouraged O to seduce Jacqueline, a vain fashion model, and lure her to Roissy. Jacqueline is repulsed when she first sees O's chains and scars, although O herself is proud of her condition as a willing slave. But Jacqueline's younger half-sister becomes enamored of O, and begs to be taken to Roissy.\nAt the climax, O is presented as a sexual slave, nude but for an owl-like mask and a leash attached to her piercing, before a large party of guests who treat her solely as an object. Afterward, she is shared by Sir Stephen and an associate of his who is referred to onlya will leaving the bulk of the estate to Patsy. Patsy refuses, and insists Jane should leave the estate to Kenneth. After fighting over this for many days, Jane pretends to give in to Patsy, but secretly invalidates the new will.\nA short while later Jane passes away in the garden, and poor gardener James is the unlucky one who finds her. He runs shrieking away, to hide in his room for days.\nThe inheritance drama comes to a head over not one last will and testament, but three. After the funeral, Silas Watson opens the envelope containing the last will, and discovers that Jane has torn off the signatures and voided it. Her previous will, leaving the estate to Patsy with token amounts to the others, comes into effect. Patsy pledges to give the estate to Kenneth when she comes of age, and to increase her cousin's cash portions.\nThe group is suddenly called to James' room, where he lies dying after being kicked by a horse. This has shocked him into his right mind for the first time since Thomas Bradley's death years ago. He tells them about the accident, and how he drew the grievously injured man from the wreck. He explains that \"Master Tom\" demanded paper to make out a new will. The conductor and James both signed it to make it legal. However, the dying James does not recognize the people around him, who look so old to his now-young brain, and refuses to give them the will. He dies, and Watson and Uncle John search the room and find it. In the hasty will, Thomas bequeathed to Jane the use of his estate during her lifetime, after which it should revert to his sister and her descendants. In other words, Jane had no ability to will anything to anyone, and Kenneth is the sole rightful heir.\nWhen this is announced, the group is shocked. There are no cash bequests to anyone – the fortune is all Kenneth's. The girls decide to go home; since Uncle John seems homeless, Patsy invites him to move in with her and her father.\nBack in New York, Uncle John is quietly bemused by their poor apartment and his bed on the sofa. When they leave for work, he slips into an uptown banker's office where he meets with important people who treat him deferentially. After a week, Patsy receives her first surprise from an unknown benefactor – keys to a lovely furnished apartment provided free for at least three years. When they nervously visit it, they discover it has been fitted out completely, and a maid rings the bell reporting for duty, all her wages prepaid.\nWhile Patsy and her father retrieve their things from the old apartment, Uncle John makes a quick visit to Louise and her mother, who treat him coldly. He leaves, embarrassed, but in the distance Louise's banker neighbor points him out: \"he's worth from eighty to ninety millions, at least, and controls most of the canning and tin-plate industries of America.\"Patsy is concerned about the apartment, but Uncle John says, \"There is nothing too good for a brave, honest girl who's [sic] heart is in the right place.\" Subsequently, Patsy reports for work and is told she's been fired. When she returns home, she finds a lady waiting to tutor her, to prepare her for women's college. That afternoon, to her delight, a piano teacher arrives. In the meantime, her father is informed that his firm's bankers would like to employ him, in a job that requires very few hours and pays a generous sum. Days later, he encounters Uncle John at the bank conducting his business, and learns the truth. At home, John points out that they all assumed he was poor, and he simply did not correct them. He promises to give the use of substantial money to both of the other girls' families, which can then be left to the nieces, so that they will not be in need.\nUncle John asks if he can continue to stay with Patsy and her father. She says, \"I never meant to part with you, when I thought you poor, and I'll not desert you now that I know you're rich.\"\n\nCriticism\nThe novel \"is genuinely original and interesting. It focuses on three adolescent girls, two of whom combine basic good character with ugly traits not usually found in fiction for young girls. Baum starts with a trite situation that could occasion prosy moralizing...and gives it several original twists.\"\n\nThe series\nThe rest of the novels in the series feature travel, adventures, accidents, a kidnapping and rescue, romances, and a marriage for Louise. The final novel, Aunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross, was originally published in 1915, when the United States was still neutral in World War I; the nieces treat the wounded of both sides, and express the hope that the War will soon be over. The publisher issued a revised edition in 1918, with a darker treatment of the subject.\nAunt Jane's Nieces, 1906 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, 1907 (2007)\nAunt Jane's Nieces at Millville, 1908 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces at Work, 1909 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces in Society, 1910 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, 1911 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces on Vacation, 1912 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces on the Ranch, 1913\nAunt Jane's Nieces Out West, 1914 (2005)\nAunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross, 1915/1918 (2006)In the original editions, each book had a cover illustration and a frontispiece. The first eight volumes in the series were illustrated by Emile A. Nelson, and the ninth by James McCracken. The tenth was illustrated by Norman P. Hall, who had contributed one picture to Baum's 1901 collection American Fairy Tales.\n(The Edith Van Dyne pseudonym was also used for other Baum works, the two Flying Girl books of 1911–12, and his Mary Louise stories of 1916–20.)\n\nPopular success\nIn their era, the Aunt Jane's Nieces books were as successful with their target audience as the Oz books were with younger children. In 1911 the six titles then in print sold 22,569 copies. Indeed, toward the end of Baum's life they outsold the Oz books. (The books were popular as grammar-school graduation gifts for girls.) After the 1920s the books were largely forgotten for the rest of the century, except for Baum enthusiasts and a small but growing coterie of Baum scholars. By the turn of the 21st century, however, the trend of re-evaluation and re-publication of Baum's works reached the series: nine of the ten books were reprinted between 2005 and 2007.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPicardy Spaniel\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.\n\nHistory\nThe French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d' Oysel described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus. Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty. The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-François Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons.The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.\n\nRecognition\nThe Epagneul Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937. A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont-Audemer Club to form the Club des Epagneuls Picards, Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer.The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, United Kennel Club, and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. All four associations use the standard as set by the FCI. It is also recognised by the Continental Kennel Club, but unlike the closely related Blue Picardy Spaniel, it is not recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club.\n\nDescription\nAppearance\nTypical examples of the breed measure between 22–24 inches (56–61 cm) at the withers, with the average weight between 20–25 kilograms (44–55 lb). The breed is similar in size to the English Setter, although is slightly smaller. Of the Spaniel type breeds, only the Large Münsterländer and Drentse Patrijshond are recognised as possibly growing to larger sizes, with the Drentse measuring 21.5–25.5 in (55–65 cm), and the Münsterländer slightly smaller with a narrower range at 23–25 in (58–64 cm).The breed has a squarely built muscular body and  an oval shaped head with a long muzzle and long ears that hang fairly low. Its coat can vary in colours from chocolate, chestnut brown and white with sandy coloured markings on the head and white or grey spots on the legs. Its hair is abundant with a slight wave, enabling it to work in dense cover and even in water.\n\nTemperament\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character with a laid-back attitude, and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for pheasants, and in swamps for snipes. However it can also be used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content with a small amount of space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.\n\nHealth\nThe Picardy Spaniel has no known hereditary health problems, and has an average lifespan of 14 years. However being a hunting spaniel, the breed is prone to ear infections. These infections are common among dogs with pendulous ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of spaniel. Overfeeding a Picardy Spaniel may lead to\noverweight.\nPassage 2:\nList of goat breeds\nGoats - farm animals of domestic goat (Capra hircus) species, small ruminants - are widespread throughout the world and are used in almost any natural and climatic conditions, even those where other productive animals cannot live. Different breeds of goats are adapted to different livestock systems - from small herds of 3-5 heads on meager grazing to large intensive livestock farms, from year-round grazing to fully stable housing, with many intermediate variations between them. Goats are a source of several types of products, of which the main ones are milk, meat and wool. Among the goat breeds there are highly productive specialized, dual-triple-use and universal breeds. External differences between breeds are represented by many major and minor traits that vary in a very wide range. Goat breeds (especially dairy goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which breed standards and production records have been kept. Selective breeding of goats generally focuses on improving production of fiber, meat, dairy products or goatskin. Breeds are generally classified based on their primary use, though there are several breeds which are considered dual- or multi-purpose.\n\nList\nPassage 3:\nBeaglier\nThis is a list of common dog crossbreeds. These are crossbreed dogs created deliberately by crossing two purebred dogs. Some are known as designer dogs and are bred as companion dogs, often given portmanteau names derived from those of the parent breeds; others are bred to combine specific working qualities inherent in the parent breeds.\n\nCrossbreeds\nSee also\nDog crossbreed\nList of dog breeds\nMongrel\nPassage 4:\nBeagle\nThe beagle is a breed of  small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The bewas officially imported into Australia in 1973.In 2000, The Kennel Club registered 424 Welsh Springer Spaniels, compared with 12,599 English Springer Spaniels and 13,445 English Cocker Spaniels. Numbers remained steady, with 420 Welsh Springer Spaniels being registered in 2004, however numbers of English Springer Spaniels increased to 14,765 and English Cocker Spaniels to 16,608. Numbers remain closer to the American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds.\n\nDescription\nAppearance\nThe Welsh Springer Spaniel is a compact, solidly built dog, bred for hard work and endurance. Their body can give the impression of length due to its obliquely angled forequarters and developed hindquarters. The build of the Welsh Springer Spaniel should be slightly off square, meaning that the length of the dog should be slightly greater than the height at the withers. However, some dogs may be square, and this is not penalised in the show ring as long as the height is never greater than the length.  Traditionally a docked breed, dependent on legislation in the country of origin, and where allowed the dew claws can be removed.In conformation showing, eyes should be brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised in the show ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.Male dogs are 46 to 48 centimetres (18 to 19 in) high at the withers, with females a little smaller at 43 to 46 centimetres (17 to 18 in). On average, members of the breed weigh between 16 and 20 kg (35 and 45 lb). The back of the legs, chest, and underside of the body are feathered, and the ears and tail are lightly feathered. The only colour is a rich red-and-white. Any pattern is acceptable and any white area may be flecked with red ticking.Welsh Springers are often confused with the English Springer Spaniel, but there are marked differences. The Welsh Springer is slightly smaller, and its reddish markings on a white background as opposed to the English Springers black or liver-coloured markings. Both breeds are admired for their hunting abilities and their trademark trait of \"springing\" at game. This can be seen during play also, as a dog may \"spring\" on his toy. Some experts believe that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the Brittany share the same ancestry as there is a great deal of resemblance between the two breeds. The colours of the Welsh Springer, while exclusive from the English Springer, appear in the Brittany and the Brittany and Welsh Springers are both of similar sizes. The Welsh Springer is larger than the English Cocker Spaniel.\n\nTemperament\nThe Welsh Springer Spaniel is active, loyal, and affectionate. They may meet strangers barking when in their territory, or act aloof, cautious or wary. The breed is well known for being friendly and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.The breed is quick to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct training can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.\n\nHealth\nThe Welsh Springer is generally a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they are prone to ear infections such as otitis externa. Some Welsh Springer Spaniels are predisposed to become overweight. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.\n\nEye disorders\nWelsh Springers can be prone to entropion, which is a disorder that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against the surface of the eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.Narrow/closed angle glaucoma is an autosomal dominant inheritable trait in the breed. It is a leading cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.\n\nSee also\nHunting dog\nSporting Group\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

He studied at Surrey Institute of Art & Design.  Early in his career he directed music videos, for instance The Ride with Alec Empire. His short film The Queue from 2007 has been shown at a number of film festivals, in particular The End Of The Pier International Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Comedy Short 2008.  In addition to directing he has worked as a documentary editor on BBC films.  He now lives in Berlin.\nPassage 2:\nThe Meerkats\nThe Meerkats, also known as Meerkats: The Movie, is a feature-length 2008 British wildlife fiction film which anthropomorphises the daily struggles of a clan of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. It was produced by BBC Films, and filmed by the award-winning BBC Natural History Unit. It is the debut directorial feature of James Honeyborne, previously a producer of natural history programmes for television. The worldwide premiere was held at the Dinard Film Festival, France in October 2008, expanding to a wide release the following week. The film was released in 2009, on 7 August in the UK. This was dedicated to actor Paul Newman, the narrator of the film, who died in 2008, shortly before this movie was released making it his final film role.\n\nPlot\nThe documentary follows the coming-of-age of a meerkat named Kolo who is forced to leave his home by a group of meerkats who want more territory. Lost in the African savannah, he tries to reunite with his family, but encounters large, fierce, and deadly creatures.\n\nProduction\nThe Meerkats was announced in November 2006 as BBC Films and The Weinstein Company agreed a co-financing deal for the film, with The Weinstein Company also handling international distribution. The year-long principal photography began on location in the Kalahari Desert, South Africa in the same month. It became the Natural History Unit's first feature-length wildlife fiction based on original material, and followed the successes of Earth (2007) and Deep Blue (2003) which were both companion pieces to BBC television series. The script was written by Alexander McCall Smith, author of many books set in Botswana. Paul Newman provides the narration, which was recorded at a studio near his home shortly before his death. The Meerkats was the final film credit of Newman's long career.Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins, a second feature-length wildlife film on meerkats, was also released in 2008. It was produced by Animal Planet, Discovery Films and Oxford Scientific Films, the makers of Meerkat Manor, but was not screened in theatres. BBC Films' Joe Oppenheimer, a producer of The Meerkats, has stated that the two films are very different in character (the BBC and Discovery originally planned to collaborate, but couldn't agree on a common ground). James Honeyborne has described The Meerkats as \"a stand-alone, blue-chip wildlife film from the ground up. It will be immersive. There will be a huge sense of place on a massive scale. You will really see real wild animals.\"\n\nAwards\nWinner, Grand Prix Earth, Special Award, Tokyo International Film Festival\nBest of Festival, Wild Talk Africa Film Festival\nWinner, Best Editing, Wild Talk Africa Film Festival\nWinner, Best Sound Design, Wild Talk Africa Film Festival\nNomination, Best Music, Wild Talk Africa Film Festival\nNomination, Best Script, Wild Talk Africa Film Festival\nWinner, Best Editing, Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival\nNomination, Best Writing, Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival\nWinner, Silver Teton, Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival\n\nReception\nWriting in The Guardian, reviewer Philip French noted that the \"nature movie made in the Kalahari desert has some good footage but is more Disney-anthropomorphic than Attenborough\".\nPassage 3:\nThe Gardener (2012 film)\nThe Gardener (Persian: باغبان,  Bāghbān) is a documentary film by Mohsen Makhmalbaf. It had its Asian premiere at Busan International Film Festival, its European premiere at Rotterdam International Film Festival, and North American premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It is the first film in decades to be made by an Iranian filmmaker in Israel. The film has been shown in more than 20 film festivals and won the Best Documentary award from Beirut International Film Festival and the special Maverick Award at the Motovun Film Festival in Croatia. The film was selected as \"Critic's Pick of the Week\" by New York Film Critics Circle, \"Best of the Fest\" at Busan Film Festival by The Hollywood Reporter, and \"Top Ten Films\" at Mumbai Film Festival by Times of India, and its script was added to the Library of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film is about an Iranian filmmaker and his son who travel to Israel to learn about the role of religion in the world. While the son goes out to the Wailing Wall, the Dome of the Rock and Christian sites, the father stays at the Baháʼí gardens to learn about a faith that came out of his own country—Iran. The film is similar to Gabbeh and The Silence in style.\nThe Gardener is set in the newly recognized UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Bahá'í World Centre buildings in Haifa and Western Galilee; and in various religious sites in Jerusalem.\n\nCast and crew\nProducers:\n\nScreenplay and director: Mohsen Makhmalbaf\nCinematography and editing: Maysam Makhmalbaf\nMusic: Paul Collier, Salar Samadi\nSound: Asad RezaiCast:\nRiriva Eona Mabi from Papua New Guinea\nPaula Asadi from Canada\nGuillaume Nyagatare from Rwanda\nTjireya Tjitendero Juzgado from Angola\nIan Huang from Taiwan and USA\nBal Kumari Gurung from Nepal\n\nFilming locations\nBaha'i Gardens in Haifa\nDome of the Rock in Jerusalem\nWailing Wall in Jerusalem\nChapel of the Ascension in Jerusalem\nBaháʼí holy places in Akko\nVarious cities in Papua New Guinea\n\nReviews\nThe Gardener has received mostly positive reviews by all critics and holds an 83% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 64 MetaScore on MetaCritics.New York Times: \"An intimate, discursive inquiry into religious belief that opens to include questions about cinema…Mr. Makhmalbaf doesn’t make that etymological connection explicit in the movie, although as he rambles throughout the Baha’i gardens, his camera inching antlike close to the ground and then soaring birdlike over the grounds, he lyrically joins the spiritual with the terrestrial.\"The Hollywood Reporter: \"The Gardener marks the first time in decades—perhaps since the Iranian Revolution in 1979—that an Iranian filmmaker has shot a movie in Israel, and what it has to say about religion and world peace is as radical a statement as unconventional filmmaker Mohof All3Media. The founders, Pattinson and Faber, left in 2012 to set up another independent production company, and  John Yorke became managing director until 2015. He was succeeded by Michele Buck, former joint managing director of Mammoth Screen.For both artistic and fiscal reasons, when producing the TV series The White Queen, Company Pictures entered into collaboration with a Flemish production house. This enabled them to film in the medieval cities of Ghent and Bruges, while receiving tax-breaks as a European co-production and for investment in Flanders.\nPassage 9:\nL (film)\nL (Learning) is a 2011 Greek comedy-drama film directed by Babis Makridis in his debut, and written by Makridis and Efthymis Filippou, based on an original idea by Yorgos Giokas.

The Italian city had hosted the event previously in 1937 (Two-man), 1939 (Four-man), 1950, and 1954. This was an extraordinary event because bobsleigh was not included in the program at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California.\n\nTwo man bobsleigh\nThe Italian duo of Monti and Alvera won their fourth straight championships in this event.\n\nFour man bobsleigh\nMedal table\nPassage 2:\nSteven Langton\nSteven Daniel Langton (born April 15, 1983) is an American bobsledder. He won silver medals in both the two-man and four-man events at the 2014 Winter Olympics, and gold in both the two-man and four-man events at the 2012 FIBT World Championships.\n\nEarly life\nLangton attended Northeastern University, in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating cum laude in 2006 with a degree in Business Management and Entrepreneurship. At Northeastern, he was a member of the track and field team and was a two-year team captain, with personal bests of 6.49 seconds in the indoor 55m dash, 10.58 seconds in the outdoor 100m dash, and 7.04m in the long jump. He was inspired to try bobsled after watching the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\nOlympic career\nAt the 2010 Olympic Games, Langton competed in both the two-man and four-man events with pilot, John Napier. Langton finished tenth in the two-man event. Due to injuries that were sustained during USA 2's crash in the second run of the four-man event, Langton and his team did compete on the second day.\nAt the 2014 Olympic Games, Langton competed in both the two-man and four-man events with pilot Steven Holcomb. He won a bronze medal (later upgraded to silver) in the two-man event at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, marking the first time in 62 years an American sled had won an Olympic medal in the two-man event. Following this accomplishment, Langton teamed with Steven Holcomb, Curt Tomasevicz and Christopher Fogt to win a bronze medal (later also upgraded to silver) in the four-man event. With this medal, they became the first American team in 62 years to win an Olympic medal in both the two- and four-man events at the same Olympics.\n\nWorld Championships and World Cups\nOutside of the Olympic Games, Langton has also won four world championships medals: bronze in the four-man in 2011 and 2013, and gold in both events in 2012. The 2012 victory marked the first time an American sled won gold in the two-man event at a world championships, and the first time the American team won both events at a single world championships.\nHe has also won 21 World Cup medals during his career: 11 gold, 7 silver and 3 bronze. During the 2010–11 season Langton also won the Inaugural World Push Championships held in Cesana Pariol, Italy.\n\nFamily\nSteven Langton's brother, Christopher Langton, was an All-Ivy lacrosse player at Cornell University. Chris served as Team USA's Alternate for the Sochi Winter Olympic Games. Another brother, Sean Langton, currently works as a dentist.\nPassage 3:\nUrs Aeberhand\nUrs Aeberhand (sometimes known as Urs Aeberhard) is a Swiss bobsledder who competed from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. He won three bronze medals at the FIBT World Championships (Two-man: 2000, Four-man: 2000, FIBT World Championships 2001).\nAeberhand also finished sixth in the four-man event at Salt Lake City in 2002.\nPassage 4:\nFIBT World Championships 1981\nThe FIBT World Championships 1981 took place in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for the seventh time, having hosted the event previously in 1937 (Two-man), 1939 (Four-man), 1950, 1954, 1960, and 1966.\nFollowing the death of West Germany's Toni Pensperger at the track in 1966, numerous safety improvements were done at the track which were satisfactory enough for the FIBT to allow the championships to be hosted. These improvements would not be enough as American bobsled driver James Morgan was killed during the third run of the four-man event.A stuntman fatality on the track a week later, during the first day of filming of For Your Eyes Only, led track officials to shorten the track to its current configuration. Cortina did not host another championship until 1989.\n\nTwo man bobsleigh\nFour man bobsleigh\nFebruary 8, 1981\n\nMedal table\nPassage 5:\nEugenio Monti track\nThe Eugenio Monti olympic track (Italian: Pista olimpica Eugenio Monti  ) is a bobsleigh and skeleton track located in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. It is named after Eugenio Monti (1928–2003), who won six bobsleigh medals at the Winter Olympic Games between 1956 and 1968 and ten medals at the FIBT World Championships between 1957 and 1966. It was featured in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, held after the 1981 FIBT World Championships, before the track was shortened to its current configuration. In January 2008, after a last bobsleigh race tournament, the track was closed.\n\nHistory\nBobsleigh at Cortina d'Ampezzo was introduced in 1905-6 using a snow-covered road on the Dolomite Road between Cortina and Pocol. An attempt was made in 1911 to build an artificial bobsleigh run near the centre of Cortina, but that failed due to funding issues. By 1923, a new track 1200 metres in length, was constructed in Ronco, a village near Cortina on the Dolomite Road laid with special water piping constructed into the earth and covered with turf to allow for track freezing.The track made its international debut in 1928 at the International University Winter Games (forerunner of the Winter Universiade, under administration by the International University Sports Federation), giving the track first notice, increasing its growth. Rebuilding of the track occurred in 1936 to meet the standards of other tracks such as St. Moritz, Switzerland and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany with the finish of the track moving down to the bank of the Boite River. This extended thehosted the 2021 Alpine World Championships, and, with Milan, will jointly host the 2026 Winter Olympics and the 2026 Winter Paralympics.\nThe town is home to SG Cortina, a professional ice hockey team in Serie A1, Italy's top division. Cortina is also the start and end point of the annual Dolomites Gold Cup Race, a historical re-evocation event for production cars on public roads. The town hosted the Red Bull Road Rage in 2009.\n\nCortina also offers skiing facilities for amateurs, centrally located among the 12 resorts of the Dolomiti Superski area. Cortina itself has 115 km (71 mi) of pistes with 34 lifts and guaranteed snow coverage of over 95% from December to April. There are six ski schools (two for cross-country) and some 300 instructors. The Faloria-Cristallo-Mietres ski area has views over the Ampezzo Valley and is suitable forall abilities, including children. The Tofane area offers more challenging opportunities from an elevation of 2,500 m (8,200 ft) with the Canalone and Schuss ski runs. The longest run, the Armentarola piste in the Lagazuoi-5 Torri area, starts next to the Lagazuoi refuge at 2,752 m (9,029 ft) and is reached by cable car. With the Forcella Staunies (currently not in operation) and the Forcella Rossa, the ski area has one of the steepest slopes in the Dolomites. There are numerous ski freeride and tour options in the mountains around Cortina.Facilities also exist for cross-country skiing, including a long stretch of the old railway line. In and around Cortina, there are opportunities to participate in many other winter sports such as curling, ski mountaineering, snowboarding, sledding, and extreme skiing. In the summer months, sports include trekking, trail running, biking, rock climbing, tennis, golf, swimming, and ice skiing. Cortina is known for the many via ferratas in the surrounding mountains such as the VF Ivano Dibona that was used in the movie Cliffhanger. The annual Lavaredo Ultra Trail series of international trail running races is based at Cortina.\n\nTransport\nCortina Airport was built for the 1956 Winter Olympics, but is currently closed. The town has its own bus service, connecting the centre to surrounding villages and cable car lifts. The nearest airports are those serving Venice: the distance to Treviso is 138 km (86 mi) while that to Venice Marco Polo Airport is 148 km (92 mi). Both can be reached in about two and a quarter hours by road. The railway station for Cortina is Calalzo di Cadore, 37 km (23 mi) to the south east, with rail connections to Venice and a bus service to Cortina. The total journey time to Venice is about three and a half hours. There are also direct bus links from Venice Mestre and Padova railway stations, coordinated with the arrivals and departures of Eurostar trains.Cortina was the principal intermediate station on the narrow-gauge (950mm) Dolomites Railway from Calalzo to Toblach. When the line was electrified in 1929  the only sub-station was established at Cortina. The line closed in 1964 but in February 2016 the regional governments of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige announced that they are to commission a feasibility study to build a new line between Calalzo, Cortina and Toblach.\n\nNotable people\nCortina has attracted many distinguished guests, often inspiring them in their creative work. They include the Italian novelists Dino Buzzati (1906–1972), author of The Tartar Steppe, Goffredo Parise (1929–1986) and Fernanda Pivano (1917–2009). Ernest Hemingway, author of A Farewell to Arms, also arrived in the area in 1918 as a young ambulance driver. Other notable visitors include John Ball (1818–1889), the Irish mountaineer and naturalist who climbed Monte Pelmo in 1857, the Italian mountaineers Emilio Comici (1901–1940), Angelo Dibona (1879–1956) and Lino Lacedelli (1925–2009), the Italian skier Kristian Ghedina (born 1969), the Italian bobsledder Eugenio Monti (1928–2003), the Austrian mountaineer Paul Grohmann (1838–1908) and the Austrian skier Toni Sailer (1935–2009). Frequent visitors include the Italian businessman and former racing driver Paolo Barilla (born 1961) and the journalist and writer Indro Montanelli (1909–2001).Among the distinguished sportsmen from Cortina itself are the skiers Enrico Colli, his younger brother Vincenzo, and Giuseppe Ghedina who competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics, Severino Menardi who participated in the 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics, and Stefania Constantini, gold-medalist curler in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Other local citizens include the climbers Angelo Dibona (1879–1956) and Lino Lacedelli (1925–2009), and the painter Luigi Gillarduzzi (1822–1856).\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns / sister cities\nCortina is twinned with:\n\n Cattolica, Italy (since 16 March 1971)\n Skardu, Pakistan\n\nSee also\nItalian front (World War I)\nWhite War\nPassage 10:\nFIBT World Championships 1966\nThe FIBT World Championships 1966 took place in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for the sixth time, having hosted the event previously in 1937 (Two-man), 1939 (Four-man), 1950, 1954, and 1960. The Four-man event was cancelled following the death of West Germany's Toni Pensperger during competition. Pensperger would be awarded a posthumous gold medal from the FIBT along with his surviving teammates Ludwig Siebert, Helmut Werzer, and Roland Ebert.

A product of the Middlesbrough youth academy, he came to prominence after making his debut aged 17 in a UEFA Cup match. He made 120 appearances for Middlesbrough, also spending time on loan at Leeds United and Watford.\nIn February 2010, Johnson moved to Manchester City, where he won the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League the following season. He was signed by his hometown club Sunderland for £10 million in 2012. Johnson played at various levels for England, earning 12 caps at senior level.\nIn March 2015, Johnson was arrested and charged over sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, with England's age of consent being 16. Johnson continued to play for Sunderland during his bail. The following February, he pleaded guilty to two charges against him, the other being one of child grooming, and was subsequently sacked by Sunderland. In March 2016, Johnson was found guilty of sexual activity with a child and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released in 2019 after serving half his sentence.\n\nEarly life\nJohnson was born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and brought up in Easington, County Durham, in North East England. He played for Cleveland Juniors Football Club and attended Easington Community Science College. Upon seeing Johnson score two goals at a Wembley Stadium seven-a-side school match, Johnny Haynes told Johnson he was \"a great little player\" with \"a lovely left foot\".\n\nClub career\nMiddlesbrough\nEarly career\nAt the age of 12, Johnson was taken in by Middlesbrough's youth academy, having previously attended Newcastle United's Centre of Excellence between 1995 and 1997. He and his Boro teammates David Wheater, Tony McMahon and Andrew Taylor were part of the squad that won the 2003–04 FA Youth Cup.He made his senior début aged 17 on 17 March 2005 in the UEFA Cup in the 1–0 defeat away to Sporting CP which saw the club eliminated 4–2 on aggregate in the last 16, replacing Doriva for the last 11 minutes. Almost six months later, on 10 September, he made his Premier League debut, and first senior start, deputising for the injured fellow academy product Stewart Downing in a 2–1 home win against Arsenal. For much of the first half of the 2005–06 season, he was on the bench as an unused substitute, mainly in the UEFA Cup matches. He made his second start in the competition against Litex Lovech on 15 December and set up Massimo Maccarone's first goal in a 2–0 win. For the rest of the season, he remained in the team's matchday squads, albeit as Downing's deputy or an unused substitute.Johnson's first goal for Middlesbrough came in a midweek Premier League match away to Bolton Wanderers on 3 May 2006, opening the scoring in a 1–1 draw with \"a mazy run from the left flank before curling in a1972 to coincide with the team reaching the 1972 FA Cup Final, composed by Les Reed and Barry Mason with the team providing the vocals. The record stayed in the UK Singles Chart for almost three months, peaking at number 10. The B-side 'Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!' (commonly known as Marching on Together) has since become the club's anthem and is regularly sung by supporters.\n\nRecords\nStriker Peter Lorimer is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, scoring 238 in his 19 years at the club across two spells; he is also the youngest player to ever play for the club. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 43 by John Charles, in the 1953–54 season. The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Jermaine Wright, when he scored after just ten seconds against Burnley in November 2004.The record transfer fee paid by Leeds for a player was around £30 million for Hoffenheim forward Georginio Rutter. The highest transfer fee received for a Leeds player was approximately £60 million from Barcelona for Raphinha; it surpassed their previous highest transfer fee received, when they sold Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for a then transfer record for a defender twenty years earlier.The club's record attendance is 57,892 against Sunderland at Elland Road, in a fifth round FA Cup replay in 1967. The highest league record at Elland Road was 52,368 for a competitive match against Manchester United on 17 April 1965.Leeds' highest ever league finish is first in the First Division in the 1968–69, 1973–74 and 1991–92 seasons. Their lowest ever league finish was fifth in League One in 2007–08, finishing the season by losing to Doncaster Rovers in the play-off final. This was their first ever season in the third tier of English football.Leeds' longest ever unbeaten run in the league was between 19 October 1968 and 30 August 1969, to which they remained unbeaten for thirty-four games on their way to the First Division title.  Their longest run of consecutive victories in the league is nine, which they achieved between 26 September 1931 and 21 November 1931 (in the Second Division).\n\nPlayers\nFirst-team squad\nAs of 9 July 2023Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nArab Kingdom of Syria\nThe Arab Kingdom of Syria (Arabic: المملكة العربية السورية, al-Mamlakah al-‘Arabīyah as-Sūrīyah) was a self-proclaimed, unrecognized constitutional monarchy existing briefly in the territory of historical Syria. It was announced on 5 October 1918 as a fully and independent Arab constitutional government with the permission of the British military. It gained de facto independence as an Emirate after the withdrawal of the British forces from OETA East on 26 November 1919, and was proclaimed as a Kingdom on 8 March 1920.\nAs a Kingdom it existed only a little over four months, from 8 March to 25 July 1920. During its brief existence, the kingdom was led by Sharif Hussein bin Ali's son Faisal bin Hussein. Despite its claims to the territory of Greater Syria, Faisal's government controlled a limited area and was dependent on Britain which, along with France, generally opposed the idea of a Greater Syria and refused to recognize the kingdom. The kingdom surrendered to French forces on 25 July 1920.\n\nHistory\nFoundations\nThe Arab Revolt and the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence were crucial factors in the foundation of the Arab Kingdom of Syria. In the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence promises of an Arab Kingdom were made by the British in return for an Arab uprising against the Ottomans.: 209–215  As the British were promising independence, The French made the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Ultimately, the implementation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement would lead to the undermining and end of the Arab Kingdom of Syria. Despite the significance of the Arab Revolt to modern Arab countries formed in its wake, at the time there was significant distrust and even opposition to the idea of an Arab Kingdom or series of Arab Kingdoms.\nThis opposition was due in part to the heavy influence of the French and the British in facilitating the revolt and the establishment of what would be considered, by modern standards, puppet states.: 185–191  The involvement of foreign powers in distributing large sums of money and military support to establish an empire that would be led by imperial aspirants, rather than legitimate Arab nationalists, was instrumental in the disintegration of the majority of the early Hashemite Kingdoms (Kingdom of Hejaz and Kingdom of Iraq). Additionally, at the time, many Arabs expressed grave concerns that the family of the Sharif of Mecca, the Hashemites, could wrest control from the Ottoman Sultan, with whom their loyalty had rested for centuries.: 187\n\nArab constitutional government\nNear the end of World War I, the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force, under command of Edmund Allenby, captured Damascus on 30 September 1918. Shortly thereafter, on 3 October, Faisal entered the city.: 30  The jubilation would be short lived, as Faisal would soon be made aware of the Sykes–Picot agreement. Faisal had come to expect an independent Arab kingdom in the name of his father but was soon told of the division of territory and how Syria fell under French protective power. Faisal saw this admission as a betrayal by the British, but believed the actual settlement would be worked out at a later date when the war had ended. There was some likelihood that by then the British would have changed their support for French pretensions in Syria.\nOn 5 October, with the permission of General Allenby, Faisal announced the establishment of a fully and absolutely independent Arab constitutional government.: 34  Faisal announced it would be an Arab government based on justice and equality for all Arabs regardless of religion. The French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau found disconcerting the establishment of a semi-independent Arab state without international recognition and under the auspices of the British. Even reassurances by Allenby that all actions taken were provisional did not ease the looming tensions between the British, the French, and the Arabs. For Arab nationalists, and many of the Arabs who fought in the Arab Revolt, this independent state would be the realization of a long hard-fought goal.\n\nDetermining the status\nAfter the war, at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Faisal pushed for Arab independence. At the Conference, the victorious Allies decided what was to become of the defeated nations of the Central Powers, especially who was to control their territories, such as the Ottoman Empire's Middle East possessions. The status of the Arab lands in the Middle East was the subject of intense negotiations between the French and British. In May 1919, the French and British prime ministers met in Quai d’Orsay to decide between them their respective claims to territories or spheres of influence in the Middle East. The meeting determined that in return for a British guarantee of French control in Syria, the British would be given a mandate over Mosul and Palestine.\nAt about the same time, an American compromise resulted in an agreement to set up a commission to determine the wishes of the inhabitants. Though they initially supported the idea, Britain and France eventually backed out, leaving the King–Crane Commission of 1919 solely American.: 268  The findings of the commission, not published until 1922 after the vote on the mandates in the League of Nations, indicated strong Arab support for an independent Arab state and opposition to a French presence.\n\nCreation\nThese events in Europe led Syrian nationalist societies like al-Fatat (the Young Arab Society) to make preparations for a national congress. These Syrian nationalist societies advocated complete independence for an Arab Kingdom that united Arabs under Faisal. The King–Crane Commission encouraged efforts to unify, and hasty elections were called including representatives from all over the Arab lands, including Palestine and Lebanon, although French officials prevented many of their representatives from arriving. The first official session of the Syrian Congress was held on 3 June 1919 and al-Fatat member Hashim al-Atassi was elected its president.: 17 When the King–Crane Commission arrived in Damascus on 25 June 1919, it was met with a flurry of leaflets saying \"Independence or Death\".\nOn 2 July the Syrian National Congress in Damascus passed the Damascus Program, a series of resolutions calling for a completely independent constitutional monarchy with Faisal as king, asking for assistance from the United States, and rejecting any rights claimed by the French.: 19  The resolutions defined the borders as \n\non the north, the Taurus Range; on the south, a line running from Rafah to Al-Jauf and following the Syria-Hejaz border below 'Aqaba; on the east, the boundary formed by the Euphrates and Khabur rivers and a line stretching from some distance east of Abu-Kamal to some distance east of al-Jauf; on the west, the Mediterranean Sea.\nAny hope that Faisal may have had that either the British or Americans would come to his aid and counter French moves quickly faded, especially after the Anglo-French Agreement for the withdrawal of British troops from Syria and the end of the British military government41 CE, Emperor Claudius added to his territory the parts of Judea province that previously belonged to Herod Archelaus. Thus Agrippa I practically re-united his grandfather's kingdom under his rule. Agrippa died in 44 CE.\nAgrippa's son Herod Agrippa II was appointed a tetrarch of Chalcis and later king of the territories previously ruled by Philip.

He began to write poems and plays from an early age. Some of his early works were written under pseudonyms, such as Loris Melikow and Theophil Morren, because he was not allowed to publish as a student. He met the German poet Stefan George at the age of seventeen and had several poems published in George's journal, Blätter für die Kunst. He studied law and later philology at the University of Vienna but decided to devote himself to writing upon graduating in 1901. Along with Peter Altenberg and Arthur Schnitzler, he was a member of the avant garde group Young Vienna (Jung–Wien).\n\nCareer\nIn 1900 Hofmannsthal met the composer Richard Strauss for the first time. He later wrote libretti for several of his operas, including Elektra (1909), Der Rosenkavalier (1911), the plot of which he developed together with Harry Graf Kessler, Ariadne auf Naxos (1912, rev. 1916), Die Frau ohne Schatten (1919), Die ägyptische Helena (1928), and Arabella (1929, but first performed in 1933).Between 1891 and 1899 Hofmannsthal wrote a number of short verse plays, influenced by the static dramas of the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck, the dramatic monologues of the English Romantic poet Robert Browning, and the proverbes dramatiques of the French poet Alfred de Musset.In 1911 he adapted the 15th century English morality play Everyman as Jedermann, and Einar Nilson wrote the music for it. The play later became a staple at the Salzburg Festival.During World War I Hofmannsthal held a government post. He wrote speeches and articles supporting the war effort, and emphasizing the cultural tradition of Austria-Hungary. The end of the war spelled the end of the Habsburg monarchy in Austria; this was a blow from which the patriotic and conservative-minded Hofmannsthal never fully recovered.Nevertheless, the years after the war were very productive ones for Hofmannsthal; he continued with his earlier literary projects, almost without a break. He wrote several new libretti for Richard Strauss operas. In 1920, Hofmannsthal, along with Max Reinhardt, founded the Salzburg Festival. His later plays revealed a growing interest in religious, particularly Roman Catholic, themes. Among his writings was a screenplay for a film version of Der Rosenkavalier (1925) directed by Robert Wiene.\n\nThought\nOn 18 October 1902 Hofmannsthal published a fictive letter in the Berlin Daily, Der Tag (The Day) titled simply \"Ein Brief\" (\"A Letter\"). It was purportedly written in 1603 by Philip, Lord Chandos, to Francis Bacon. In this letter Chandos says that he has stopped writing because he has \"lost completely the ability to think or to speak of anything coherently\"; he has given up on the possibility of language to describe the world. This letter reflects the growing distrust of and dissatisfaction with language that so characterizes the Modern era, and Chandos's dissolving personality is not only individual but societal.Growing up the son of a wealthy merchant who was well connected with the major artists of the time, Hofmannsthal was raised in what Carl Schorske refers to as \"the temple of art\". This perfect setting for aesthetic isolation allowed Hofmannsthal the unique perspective of theGerman articles, prose and poetry. He is the founder and publisher of the only existing Pennsylvania German newspaper, Hiwwe wie Driwwe.\n\nLife\nWerner was raised in the Palatinate (Germany). Members of his family had emigrated from this area to the U.S. in the 19th century. He studied at the University of Mannheim and holds a Master's degree in General Linguistics, Germans Studies and Sociology. His Ph.D. Thesis is dealing with Pennsylvania German literature. Werner is working as publishing director of a B2B publishing house in Mainz (Germany). He lives in Ober-Olm.\n\nActivities\nIn 1993, he became a student of C. Richard Beam (1925-2018), director of the Center for Pennsylvania German Studies at Millersville University (PA). In the same year, Werner started a private \"Archive for Pennsylvania German Literature\" in the Palatinate, Germany. In 1996, the newspaper Hiwwe wie Driwwe was founded by him in Ebertsheim, Palatinate (Germany). Actually, it is being published bi-annually. Since 1998, he has been a member of the jury of the oldest Palatine Dialect Writers Contest in Bockenheim an der Weinstraße, Palatinate (Germany). In 2003, Michael Werner was one of the co-founders of the German-Pennsylvanian Association and the first president of the association (until 2010). Since 2008, Werner invites speakers of Pennsylvania German to give presentations about the language and culture in Germany. In 2013, \"Hiwwe wie Driwwe\" started a cooperation with the Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center at Kutztown University (PA). The editorial office was moved to Pennsylvania in 2015. In 2017, Werner donated his private archive of Pennsylvania German literature and folk life to the Mennonite Research Center at Weierhof (Palatinate, Germany), where it will be presented to the public as \"Deutsch-Pennsylvanisches Archiv\" (German-Pennsylvanian Archive). In 2020, he was one of the founders of Groundhog Lodge No. 19 in Bockenheim (Palatinate, Germany). In 2021, Werner published a German trip advisor to the Pennsylvania Dutch Country.\n\nTrivia\nHis journalistic work over a period of three decades inspired two German cinema documentaries: \"Hiwwe wie Driwwe 1\" (2019) and \"Hiwwe wie Driwwe 2\" (coming up 2024).\n\nWorks\nWerner, Michael (Ed.): Hiwwe wie Driwwe.

The show has a loose format atypical for television comedy series, consisting of largely unconnected storylines and segments (described as \"extended vignettes\") that revolve around Louie's life, punctuated by live stand-up performances.\nThe season received critical acclaim from critics.\n\nCast\nMain cast\nLouis C.K. as Louie\n\nRecurring cast\nGuest stars\nNick DiPaolo as Nick (\"Niece\")\nJim Norton as Jim (\"Oh, Louie/Tickets\")\nChris Rock as Chris (\"New Jersey/Airport\")\nGodfrey as Godfrey (\"Niece\")\nF.

Verne Gay of Newsday praised Jenna's and Kenneth's storylines, and liked the cameo by Broderick, stating his \"comic chops [were] on full display\". Robert Canning of IGN praised Kenneth's and Tracy's storylines, and described Tracy's voice-recording session for his porn video game as \"thank-goodness-this-is-airing-later-than-8:30\".

Perigard of the Boston Herald felt that \"Cooter\" was one of the best episodes of 30 Rock's shortened season, with something for everyone in the ensemble cast to do.  He noted that Fey's character, Liz, has a pregnancy scare the same week that Fey's film, Baby Mama, was in theaters, asking \"How much mama drama does Tina Fey think viewers want?\" Bob Sassone of TV Squad originally thought the episode might have been secretly cross promoting Baby Mama, but ultimately decided against this judgment. Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly was disappointed that Liz was not actually pregnant, and hoped that her former boyfriend, Dennis, would continue to reappear in the next season. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the episode may have been hinting at Alec Baldwin's real-life political plans.

On his turn, a player moves all of the huts from one space to another space. When a group of huts is completely isolated (all the surrounding spaces are empty) that space is scored. Scoring is different based on the terrain that those huts are on. The person with the most huts on that space, and anyone tied for the most, gets points.

Buildings are already completed and each player is secretly assigned one of six types of buildings, that each appear five times on the board. Buildings closer to the center of the board have a higher point value. Each player is given an identical set of vote cards that are worth varying degrees of yes or no. Every turn, players lay down tiles of streets, rivers, and town walls which add on to existing pieces. Buildings can be covered by tiles, but when someone attempts to build over an outhouse everyone votes on whether to allow it or not. If there are more negative votes, the tile does not get played. Each player tries to keep his or her buildings uncovered. The game ends when all the pieces have been placed or all players pass consecutively; then everyone tallies their score from their remaining buildings on the map and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nAwards\nSpiel des Jahres Game of the Year 1991\nDeutscher Spiele Preis 1991 3rd place\n\nReviews\nReview by Doug Adams\nReview by Debbie Pickett\nReview from Sumo, Issue 5, June 1991\nPassage 4:\nAlex Randolph\nAlexander Randolph (4 May 1922 – 27 April 2004) was a Bohemian-American designer of board games and writer.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPop'n TwinBee\nPop'n Twinbee (ポップンツインビー) is a top-view shoot-'em-up game originally released in 1993 by Konami for the Super Famicom in Japan. The game was also released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the PAL region. It is the sixth game in the TwinBee series and a direct follow-up to the arcade game Detana!! TwinBee (Bells & Whistles). The European version was published by Konami's Palcom Software division and was the first of three TwinBee games localized for the European market, followed by a Game Boy version of Pop'n TwinBee (which was actually an earlier game titled TwinBee Da!! in Japan) and the side-scrolling platform game Pop'n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures. It was released in North America 27 years after its Super Famicom launch through a February 2020 update to the Nintendo Switch Online Super NES library.\n\nPlot\nThe game's opening sequence shows TwinBee and WinBee patrolling the skies of Donburi Island when they suddenly receive a distress signal from a young girl named Madoka. Madoka reveals that she is the granddaughter of Dr. Mardock, who was once a benevolent scientist until a bump in the head turned him insane. Dr. Mardock now seeks to conquer the world with an army of Acorn Men and only TwinBee and WinBee can stop him.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is similar to Detana!! TwinBee, the second coin-op game in the series, but with a few notable additions and changes. Like in previous TwinBee, up to two players can play simultaneously, Player 1 controls TwinBee (the blue aircraft), while Player 2 controls WinBee (the pink aircraft). When the player begins the game, they'll be asked to enter their name and choose between three types of companion ships (whether their companions will follow their ship, engulf them, or surround them). The player's objective is to maneuver their spacecraft through a series of seven stages and defeat every enemy who gets in the way, facing a boss at the end of each stage. Unlike previous games, instead of extra lives, the player has a life meter that determines how much damage the player's ship can take before losing. When the player loses, they will be given a chance to restart at the stage where they left off, but only limited chances are given to continue.\nLike in previous TwinBee games, the player shoots at airborne enemies with their gun and drops bombs to the land. The player can also attack airborne enemies with their ship's punches as well at close range. The player can shoot tiny-sized replicas of their ship that will fly and attack all on-screen enemies. The player can only perform this attack based on the number of stocks they have. During a 2-player game, one player can give the other player a bit of their life energy to replenish it or even use the other player's ship as a projectile against the enemy. As usual, the main power-up items are bells that can change colors by shooting them in the air, giving the player a different upgrade when one is retrieved depending on the bell's color.\nOn the game's option settings, the player can adjust the game's difficulty, controls, and sound, as well as switch between \"normal\" and \"couple\" mode. During couple mode, the enemy attacks will aim primarily at Player 1 if two players are playing together. This feature is intended to allow less experienced players enjoy the game if they're playing with a more experience partner.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe upbeat and light hearted soundtrack, composed by Kazuhiko Uehara among others, takes influence from Japanese Idol songs.\n\nReception\nThe game was reviewed by Weekly Famitsu, and was given a score of 30 out of 40.\nPassage 2:\nSuper Ghouls 'n Ghosts\nSuper Ghouls 'n Ghosts, known in Japan as Super Demon World Village, is a platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. As the third game in the Ghosts 'n Goblins series and the first not to be released for the arcade, it again depicts knight Arthur saving Princess Guinevere and the kingdom from Emperor Sardius, who has cast a spell that has revived the Ghoul Realm.\nThe game has been included in multiple compilations of Capcom classics. A remake was released for the Game Boy Advance which features an additional game mode with new stages.\n\nGameplay\nSuper Ghouls 'n Ghosts is a side-scrolling platform game with reduced emphasis on run and gun and more on platforming. As in the predecessor Ghosts 'n Goblins, the player takes the role of the knight Arthur, who must save Princess Guinevere and rid the kingdom of the Ghoul Realm which is revived under a spell of Emperor Sardius (known as Samael in the Japanese version), who has kidnapped Guinevere in the Phantom Zone. The game has four difficulty settings (easy, normal, difficult, and professional), and the player can set up to nine lives. However, there are also only six continues.In each of the eight levels (named Quests), four of them consisting of two sections, Arthur, has a time limit to fight ghouls before defeating a Foul Guardian that protects the gate to the next stage. The first five Quests (The Dead Place, The Rotting Sea, Vermilion Horror, The Ghoul's Stomach, and The Deep Chill) take place in a variety of locations, such as graveyards, abandoned ships on sea, flame-filled caverns, and locales consisting of ice and snow. The final three Quests (The Castle of the Emperor, Hallway of Ghouls, and The Throne Room) are areas of Sardius's castle. Parts of the environment, such as earth ground lifting caused by earthquakes, blizzards, heavy sea waves, and avalanches, are also threats to Arthur. Ice Wall, the second section of the fifth level, depicts Arthur scaling a rotating palace as in Nebulus (1987).Arthur starts in the Steel Armor with a lance. If he gets hit by an enemy or projectile, he loses his armor and is reduced to his underpants; getting hit again results in the loss of a life. An ability not present in previous series entries is the double jump, which allows Arthur to leap, then jump again when in mid-air. Although there is no control of momentum during a single jump, Arthur can change direction through a double jump. Other weapons can be picked up along the way, such as a faster-speed knife, hatchets, cross bows, daggers, and torches with short arcs that explode on contact. However, only one can be held at a time. Like in Ghouls n' Ghosts, hidden treasure chests can be found for weapons, armor upgrades, and bonus points. Chests have unwanted deadly traps, and an magician, the Conjurer, transforms Arthur into one of four weaker forms temporarily: a baby, a girl, a seal or a wasp. Chests only appear when moving through specific areas of the screen.Bronze and Gold armor is collectable. Athat own the original game, but commended the physical release and the added value for new players and hardcore fans.\n\nLegacy\nSonic Mania was nominated for the \"Best Family Game\" at The Game Awards 2017 and the \"Best Kids Game\" at the 2018 New York Game Awards. The theme song \"Friends\" was reused for the prologue of the 2020 Sonic the Hedgehog film.\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nCaptain Comic\nThe Adventures of Captain Comic is a platform game written by Michael Denio for MS-DOS compatible operating systems and released as shareware in 1988. It was one of the first side-scrolling games for IBM PC compatibles reminiscent of games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it presaged a trend of shareware platform games in the early 1990s. A version for the NES was later published by Color Dreams as an unlicensed title.\nA sequel, Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality, was released in 1990.\n\nPlot\nCaptain Comic is on a mission to the planet Tambi, where the quest begins. Comic must find three artifacts: the Mystical Gems of Lascorbanos, the Thousand Coins of Tenure, and the Crown of the Ages. To find them, he must travel through many varied environments. The game is completed when Comic is in possession of all three treasures.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is divided into eight major areas, and each contains three smaller zones. Transitioning between zones plays a short tune, all enemies are removed from the screen, and Comic's position is saved.\nComic has twelve \"shield\" points which act as health. Each time an enemy hits him, two points are removed. When at zero, Comic dies on the next hit. Occasionally, shields can be found which instantly replenish the health to full, or if it is already full, give an extra life. Comic starts with four lives, and an extra life is given for each 50,000 points earned if Comic isn't already at the maximum of five extras.\nIf Comic is killed by either falling off the bottom of the screen, or  hit with no shield points remaining, a life is lost and he is returned to the point where he last entered this zone.\nEnemies have different behaviors, from simply bouncing off walls and following preset paths to seeking Comic as he passes by. After picking up a Blastola Cola, Comic can shoot at and destroy enemies for points.\n\nDevelopment\nMichael Denio previously wrote an interactive demo of a  platform game called The Adventures of Captain Pixel of the Galactic Security Patrol in 34010 AD for a TMS34010 coprocessor board. The credits screen has a 1987 copyright notice for the graphics. The TMS34010 is a CPU with graphics-oriented instructions which was later used in arcade video games such as Narc and Mortal Kombat. \nDenio wrote in the introduction to the Captain Comic manual:\n\nThe Adventures of Captain Comic started out as an experiment to test the viability of two theories, the first as to whether a real arcade type game can be done on a standard IBM PC with an EGA card, and secondly, given the first can be done, if it is possible to make any money doing it. Well, I've come to a conclusion on the second point, but I'll let you judge the first point for yourself.\n\nMusic\nThe original theme song for Captain Comic was a rendition of the United States Marine Corps Hymn. The song was replaced in the final revision of the game, released in 1991, by George Frideric Handel's Harpsichord Suite in D Minor, HWV 428, Air. The NES version of the soundtrack is composed entirely of classical music.\n\nReception\nLegacy\nA sequel from the same author was published in 1990 as Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality.\nIn 2012, PC World called Captain Comic the twelfth greatest shareware game of all time, writing that \"it inspired many other shareware authors, including the folks who would later create Commander Keen.\"The original game was cloned for the SAM Coupé. It was also cloned as The Adventures of Pioneer Kseniauk in 1990 by a team of Ukrainian programmers.\nPassage 6:\nChristian Whitehead\nChristian Whitehead, also known by his alias The Taxman, is an Australian video game programmer and designer. He is most recognized for his work creating updated ports of early games in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, as well as being the lead developer of an original game in the series, Sonic Mania. He has also developed multiple remakes of classic Sonic games and most recently, the remasters in Sonic Origins.\n\nCareer\nIn 2006, Whitehead worked as a freelance 3D animator with the company Kine Graffiti. Since 2009, he has focused on game development, developing various fangames based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series. In 2009, Whitehead produced a \"proof-of-concept\" video of Sonic CD running on an iPhone using his own custom engine, the \"Retro Engine\". In an interview with Steven O'Donnell of Good Game: Spawn Point, Whitehead proclaims that he spent \"about a year or so\" convincing Sega to let him work on the Sonic CD port. In 2009, a video regarding Sonic CD from Whitehead was taken down, leading Eurogamer to report that Whitehead possibly faced a cease and desist letter from Sega, which Whitehead claimed was false. The port was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, iPhone and Android in 2011. His remake was so successful that he, along with developer Simon \"Stealth\" Thomley of the studio Headcannon, would later be commissioned to remaster Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for mobile devices.Although he, along with Headcannon, released a proof-of-concept video for a Sonic the Hedgehog 3 remaster in 2014, Sega did not greenlight the port. In 2015, it was announced that Whitehead would be involved in his first non-Sonic game, Freedom Planet 2. In 2017, Whitehead, in collaboration with Headcannon and PagodaWest Games, developed and released their own original title in the Sonic series, titled Sonic Mania. In 2018, Sonic Mania became Sonic Mania Plus, with the release of the Encore DLC. Sonic Mania Plus was developed by Whitehead, Headcannon, PagodaWest Games, and the now included HyperKinetic. Whitehead also contributed to the development of Sonic Origins, providing a new version of the engine used in the remasters. Whitehead is currently working on Freedom Planet 2, built with the Unity engine, for PC, Mac, and Linux.In late 2018, Whitehead and other development members behind Sonic Mania founded their own studio Evening Star Studio, where he serves as creative director and lead engine architect.\n\nWorks\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRichie Ginther\nPaul Richard \"Richie\" Ginther (Hollywood, California, August 5, 1930 – September 20, 1989 in France) was a racecar driver from the United States. During a varied career, the 1965 Mexican Grand Prix saw Ginther take Honda's first Grand Prix victory, a victory which would also prove to be Ginther's only win in Formula One. Ginther competed in 54 World Championship Formula One Grand Prix races and numerous other non-Championship F1 events.\n\nEarly career\nRichie Ginther was born in Hollywood but his family moved to Ohio for his father's work before moving back to California and to Santa Monica, the same Californian town as future Formula One World Champion Phil Hill, and it was through Hill, a friend of Ginther's older brother, George, that he first began to race. After finishing school in 1948, Ginther followed in his father's footsteps and went to work for Douglas Aircraft, initially in the tool and die shop. In his spare time he helped Hill to repair, maintain and race his collection of old cars and hot rods, as Hill's racing career began to gather pace. Ginther made his race debut at Pebble Beach in 1951, driving a Ford-engined MG T-type sports car.However, Ginther's career was put on hold shortly after, when he was drafted for two years of national service during the Korean War. During this time he received training and experience working in aircraft and engine mechanics, skills which he would later put to good use during his driving career. On emergence from the military, Hill requested that Ginther join him, principally as a riding mechanic, in driving a privately entered 4.1-liter Ferrari in the 1953 Carrera Panamericana. The pair ran high in the rankings until Hill lost control, crashed, and wrote off the car. Both Ginther and Hill were unharmed and returned in 1954 to take second place, beaten only by the works Ferrari of Umberto Maglioli.\nNineteen fifty-four was also the year that Ginther returned to race driving himself, mostly in a self-prepared Austin-Healey. His results were impressive enough that the following year VW and Porsche dealer John von Neumann hired him to drive a Porsche in domestic competitions. When von Neumann started dealing in Ferrari cars in 1956, Ginther also got the chance to drive these. In between working in von Neumann's Ferrari dealership — including trips to the Ferrari factory in Italy to sort customer problems — Ginther began to build an impressive racing reputation on the West Coast. This, and his choice of Ferrari mounts, brought him to the attention of the East Coast Ferrari franchise-holder, three-time 24 Hours of Le Mans-winner, Luigi Chinetti. Aside from importing Ferrari road cars, Chinetti also operated a successful race team, soon to metamorphose into Ferrari's official motorsport presence in North America: NART. Ginther first raced for Chinetti in 1957 and with him made his first appearances in international-level events, first in the 12 Hours of Sebring and then driving a two-liter Ferrari 500 TR in the 1957 Le Mans race.\nAlso in 1957, Ginther was signed to drive the Aston Martin of Joe Lubin and over the next three years would continue to compete in many sports car racing events in both Aston and Ferrari machinery, with great success. That June, he won a 15-lap GT race at the new Lime Rock Park, and won the opening race of the national championship in his Ferrari. In early-1958, he piloted a two-liter Ferrari to victory at the County Fairgrounds in Pomona, California, averaging 83.8 mph (134.9 km/h), and won in a three-liter GT in a five-lap qualifying preliminary for the SCCA Pacific Coast Championship. By the end of the year Ginther had captured the Pacific Coast Sports Car Championship outright. He triumphed by a wide margin at Pomona at the opening sports car race of 1959, in a von Neumann 4.1-liter Ferrari, and in June 1959, won in a three-liter Ferrari TR in the first Hourglass road races in San Diego, California. Throughout this period he continued to mix his race driving with a steady job at von Neumann's dealership, and by late 1959 the strain was beginning to show.\n\nFormula One\nFerrari\nGinther made his F1 debut at the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix driving for Ferrari, which he stayed with through 1961. In the September 1960 Italian Grand Prix in Monza, he placed second to Hill. Ginther led from the start until the 25th lap when Hill passed him and led until the finish.Following the 1960 season the Ferrari team gave up 1000 cc in engine size. The 2500 cc engine,\npermitted the previous year, was replaced by a 1.5-liter rear-engine model, with 110 less horsepower. However, the newer engine was superior in both \"profiling\" and handling. The conservative Enzo Ferrari was the last major Formula 1 race car manufacturer to make the transition to cars with engines in the rear.\nIn 1961, Ginther was the No. 3 Ferrari driver, behind No. 1 Wolfgang Von Trips and No. 2 Hill. Giancarlo Baghetti occasionally piloted a fourth car. The team manager was Romulo Tavoni.On May 14, 1961, Ginther finished second to Stirling Moss at the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, 3.6 seconds behind, a few hundred feet. He was driving a new rear-engine Ferrari with a 120-degree V-6 which had a lower center of gravity. Ginther had qualified second, just ahead of Hill, with an average speed of 70.7 mph (113.8 km/h), and a qualifying time of 1:39.3. He eclipsed the previous course record of 1:39.6, before Moss took pole position the day after.In August 1961, Ginther and Baghetti were teammates at the Pescara Grand Prix, a world auto manufacturers' championship event. Their Ferrari was leading on the 10th lap when it stopped on a straight stretch with a flat tire. Ginther averaged more than 133 mph (214 km/h) on the 6.2-mile (10.0 km) Autodromo Nazionale Monza in September 1961, to lead the first day of qualifying for the 1961 Italian Grand Prix. Von Trips qualified first with Ginther taking the third starting position after Ricardo Rodriguez. Ginther retired in the race. Von Trips died in a spectacular crash on the second lap, which also killed eleven spectators, when his Ferrari climbed a 5-foot-high (1.5 m) earth embankment. \nIt brushed a wire fenceconsidered one of the most powerful and most dominant racing machines ever created.\n\nFirst IROC champion\nDonohue raced in the inaugural IROC series in 1973–74, racing identical, specially-prepared Porsche RSRs. In the four-race series, Donohue won the first and third of three races at Riverside and the final race of the year at Daytona. The only person to beat Donohue was his former Penske Trans-Am teammate, George Follmer. In winning the first IROC championship, Donohue beat the best racing drivers of that era from all of the major championships, such as Denny Hulme, Richard Petty, A. J. Foyt, Emerson Fittipaldi, Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Peter Revson, Bobby Unser, and Gordon Johncock.\n\nRetirement and Formula One\nThe pressures of racing and designing the car took their toll on Donohue. By 1973, the \"Captain Nice\" nickname he had earned earlier in his career was being supplanted by the nickname \"Dark Monohue\".  Donohue announced that he would retire from racing after the 1973 Can-Am season. In addition, the horrific events at the 1973 Indianapolis 500 and the subsequent death of his friend, Swede Savage, pushed him to quit. His retirement was short-lived, however, as he was lured back to full-time competitive driving by Penske when he formed a Formula One team, Penske Cars Ltd, to compete in the final two events of the 1974 Formula One World Championship, and to continue competing in 1975 with the new Penske PC1.\n\nDonohue previously had debuted in Formula One on September 19, 1971, with a Penske-sponsored McLaren at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, finishing on the podium in third place. After coming out of retirement with his former boss, Penske, Donohue returned to Formula One, entering into the final two races of the 1974 Formula One season. Donohue finished in 12th place at the Canadian Grand Prix, but failed to finish at the United States Grand Prix.\nA full season of racing for the 1975 Formula One season was planned. The 1975 season turned out to be a difficult one for Donohue and Penske.  Donohue was able to muster fifth-place finishes at the Swedish Grand Prix and the British Grand Prix, but the new Penske PC1 chassis proved problematic, as evidenced by three retirements in the first six races. At the Austrian Grand Prix, Donohue's career, along with Roger Penske's Formula One aspirations, took a tragic turn.\n\nDeath\nMidway through the 1975 F1 season, Penske abandoned the troublesome PC1 and started using the March 751. Donohue recently had arrived in Austria for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring race track following the successful closed-course speed record attempt at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama just a few days earlier. During a practice session for the race, Donohue lost control of his March after a tire failed, sending him into the catch fencing at the fastest corner on the track, Vöest Hügel Kurve. A track marshal was killed by debris from the accident, but Donohue did not appear to be injured significantly. It is said that Donohue's head struck either a catch fencing post or the bottom of the wood frame for an advertising billboard located alongside of the racetrack. A headache resulted, however, and worsened. After going to the hospital in Graz the next day, Donohue lapsed into a coma from a cerebral hemorrhage and died. He was survived by his second wife and two sons from his first marriage. Donohue is buried at St. Teresa Cemetery in Summit, New Jersey.\n\nCommemorations and legacy\nIn 2003, in commemoration of Penske Racing's 50th NASCAR win, Nextel Cup driver Ryan Newman drove a Dodge Intrepid painted to resemble Donohue's 1973 AMC (with a No. 12 and current Alltel decals) at the fall Rockingham, North Carolina, race.\nPenske's new Penske Racing complex in Mooresville, North Carolina is decorated with various murals of Donohue and his racing cars, most notably the AMC stock car and the various Porsche prototypes that Donohue drove through his career.\nDonohue chronicled his entire racing career in the book, The Unfair Advantage (co-written with noted motorsports and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the engineering approach he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always looking for that elusive \"unfair advantage\". Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable as the use of a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the antilock braking system and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue's death.\nThe book was re-released in 2000 by Bentley Publishers (Cambridge, Massachusetts). It includes information and additional photography that was not available before the first edition was published.\nDonohue's racing tradition is carried on by his son, David Donohue, a successful road racer in his own right.\n\nAwards\nDrexel University presented Mark Donohue with its Engineering and Science Award in 1973.\nMark Donohue was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990.\nHe was also inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1990.\nHe was inducted in the Sports Car Club of America Hall of Fame in its 2006 class.\n\nMotorsports career results\nSCCA National Championship Runoffs\nFormula One World Championship\n(key)\n\nFormula One Non-Championship\n(key)\n\nComplete USAC Championship Car results\nIndianapolis 500 results\nNASCAR\nWinston Cup Series\nDaytona 500\nInternational Race of Champions\n(key) (Bold – Pole position. * – Most laps led.)\n\nComplete Canadian-American Challenge Cup results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete 24 Hours of Le Mans results\nSee also\nRoger Penske\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway\nGeorge Follmer\nWalt Hansgen\nSkidpad\nTurbocharger\nBrown University\nLola Cars\nVehicle Dynamics\nElva (car manufacturer)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The massacre seems to be related to the Brandon James murders, who was supposedly obsessed with Emma's mother Maggie Duvall (Tracy Middendorf).\nThe episode revolves around the aftermath of Nina Patterson's gruesome murder at the hands of an unknown killer after she uploaded a video of Audrey, a closeted bicurious teen, kissing another girl. Nina's close-knit friends hold a memorial party for her, meanwhile Emma and her mother are taunted by the killer.\nThe episode aired on June 30, 2015 on MTV and received mixed reviews from critics, though critics and fans of the film series praised the opening sequence and Bella Thorne's performance, comparing the scene to the opening scene in the first Scream film.\n\nPlot\nAfter posting a shaming video online of classmate Audrey Jensen (Bex Taylor-Klaus) and Rachel Murray (Sosie Bacon) kissing, Nina Patterson (Bella Thorne) is dropped off at her house by her boyfriend Tyler O'Neill (Max Lloyd-Jones). While Nina is home alone, the Lakewood Slasher impersonates Tyler and taunts Nina with video clips and text messages sent from Tyler's phone. Nina's relaxation in the hot tub is interrupted when Tyler's severed head is suddenly thrown into the water. She screams and jumps out of the pool. After failing to call for help, she runs to try and open the doors, when the Lakewood Slasher appears behind her and slashes across her back. She then tries to run but is attacked by the Lakewood Slasher, who slits her throat and throws her in the pool.\nThe next morning, Emma Duval (Willa Fitzgerald) is studying with her boyfriend Will Belmont (Connor Weil).

Daisy is revealed to secretly be Emma's mother Maggie Duvall (Tracy Middendorf), who works as the coroner in the town of Lakewood.\nThe students learn that Tyler is missing and is a suspect in Nina's murder. In an effort to renew their former friendship, Emma invites Audrey to a party Brooke is throwing as a memorial for Nina. Will and Jake have a tense confrontation with each other over a secret involvement they had with Nina. Language Arts teacher Seth Branson (Bobby Campo) tries unsuccessfully to end his affair with Brooke. Back at home, Emma finds a package on her doorstep addressed to Daisy. After Emma leaves with Will for Brooke's party, Maggie opens the package and finds a note that reads, \"Emma looks just like you at that age\" along with a bloody animal heart.\nMeanwhile, at the party, Audrey and Emma later bond while having a poolside conversation. Riley takes an interest in Noah. Maggie calls Sheriff Clark Hudson (Jason Wiles) about the anonymous package. Clark promises to track down Emma's father Kevin. Noah continues discussing Brandon James, Nina's murder, and teenage horror tropes with other partygoers. Brooke hints that Will and Nina had some sort of connection and Emma realizes that Will slept with Nina. After confronting Will, Emma walks off alone and finds Kieran in the greenhouse. Kieran explains the family circumstances that brought him to Lakewood.

He flew more than 500 combat sorties in Palestine and on the Western Front. He scored seven confirmed aerial victories in the latter theater. His later career led him to join the Luftwaffe during World War II. Toward the end of the war, he was captured by the Russians and died in one of their prison camps in December 1945.\n\nBiography\nFranz Walz was born in Speyer, Kingdom of Bavaria, the German Empire on 4 December 1885.

However, Walz was found lacking as a leader of fighter pilots, and on 25 August 1917 was transferred from France on the Western Front to the Middle East to command Flieger-Abteilung 304 (Flier Detachment 304). Here he became known as \"The Eagle of Jericho\".On 22 July 1918, the Ottoman Empire awarded Franz Walz its Silver Liakat Medal. On 9 August 1918, despite his low aerial victory score, he was awarded the Pour le Merite for prolonged service in command. By this time, he had flown over 500 combat sorties.The Turkish award of the Order of Osmanieh Fourth Class with Swords followed on 15 September 1918. By this time, Walz had also been granted three decorations by his native Kingdom of Bavaria, as well as another from their Austro-Hungarian allies.On 20 September 1918, Walz fell into British captivity. He was released after war's end, on 1 December 1919.\n\nPost World War I\nFranz Walz served with both the Reichswehr and the State Police. Once the Luftwaffe was established, Walz returned to aviation duty and ascended in rank. On 1 April 1941, he became a Generalleutnant. Later in World War II, he would be captured by the Russians.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThoroughbred Racing on ESPN\nESPN and ESPN2's coverage of Thoroughbred racing consisted of NTRA Racing to the Kentucky Derby., Road To The World Thoroughbred Championships/NTRA Racing to the Breeders' Cup, a series of prep races for the Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships, the post position draw for the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes undercard races, the Kentucky Oaks and Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, NTRA 2Day At the Races, Racing Across America, the Preakness undercard races, the Eclipse Awards show, and Long John Silver's Wire to Wire (previously known as RaceHorse Digest), a weekly thoroughbred racing magazine show. They also had Triple Crown morning shows such as Breakfast at Churchill Downs and Breakfast at Pimlico. ESPN also broadcast NTRA Super Saturdays as well. \nFrom 2006 to 2011, ESPN broadcast the Breeders' Cup. ESPN on ABC also broadcast a portion of the Breeders' Cup.\n\nNTRA Racing to the Kentucky Derby\nNTRA Racing to the Kentucky Derby was a series of races produced by NTRA Productions that air on ESPN or ESPN2. These networks currently air seven races under the Racing to the Kentucky Derby banner. They are the Lane's End Stakes, Rushaway Stakes, Florida Derby, Swale Stakes, Arkansas Derby, Blue Grass Stakes, and Lexington Stakes. Previous races broadcast on ESPN as part of NTRA Racing to the Kentucky Derby include the Fountain of Youth Classic, Louisiana Derby, El Camino Real Derby, Gotham Stakes, UAE Derby, Santa Anita Derby, Illinois Derby, Wood Memorial, Holy Bull Stakes, Hutcheson Stakes, and Federico Tesio Stakes.\n\nPersonalities\nAmong ESPN's regulars on its horse racing telecasts were hosts Chris Lincoln, Chris Fowler, Joe Tessitore and Kenny Mayne, along with analysts Charlsie Cantey, Dave Johnson, Bob Neumeier, Jerry D. Bailey and Randy Moss, handicapper Hank Goldberg and reporters Lesley Visser, Jeannine Edwards and Jay Privman.\nPassage 2:\nPolitical handicapping\nThe terms horse race and handicapping the horse race, have been used to describe media coverage of elections. The terms refer to any news story or article whose main focus is describing how a particular candidate or candidates is faring during the election, in other words, trying to predict the outcome. This category includes polls. There is a thin line between a horse race news story and a non horse race news story. For example, an article simply describing a candidate's economic policy is a non horse race article, but an article which is about how certain groups of voters are angry at a candidate's economic policy is a horse race article.\n\nCriticisms of horse race coverage\nCritics of the news media say that the vast majority of all articles during a political election are horse race style. Different criticisms have been raised as to why that is bad:\n\nIt is argued that news sources tend to use horse race journalism as a ploy to lure in audiences and tighten polls during election cycles by discrediting candidates favored to win and hyping underdogs\nHorse race coverage is considered by some to cause voters to change their actual perceptions on a candidate in a sort of vicious cycle. For example, a poll showing a third party candidate having a low support percentage may discourage other people from voting for that person so as to avoid the spoiler effect. That effect is magnified if a particular media outlet has a biased point of view that they want to get across. One way that a biased news outlet would use this technique is similar to the \"some say\" rhetorical device, namely by making uncited references to constituent outrage or support of some particular issue.\nSome say that horse race coverage destroys coverage of the issues, because often, an article is mostly about how groups reacted to a speech or other presentation of a candidate on an issue and has little room to discuss the candidate's point of view itself.\nA horse race style of article allows for the use of weasel words: a subtle way of editorializing on the part of the author by focusing on the criticisms or praise of an anonymous or small group of voters.\nIt is argued that horse race coverage distracts voters from issues surrounding candidates by emphasizing poll results, regardless of how reliable the polls may be.\n\nSee also\nPollster\nSwingometer\n\nExternal links\nPolitical Glossary: Horse Race\nIn Defense of (the Right Kind of) Horse Race Journalism\nHyping The Horse Race\nPassage 3:\nSet Weights\nSet Weights (SW) is a condition for a Thoroughbred horse race. Horses carry a weight based on their age and sex. In a mixed-sex race, fillies and mares will usually carry less than colts, geldings and horses. Additional weight, or penalties, can also apply as a condition of the race. Many of the top races, particularly age-restricted races, are set weights races.\n\nSee also\nWeight for Age\nPassage 4:\n2013 Preakness Stakes\nThe 2013 Preakness Stakes was the 138th running of the Preakness Stakes thoroughbred horse race. The race was held on May 18, 2013, and was televised on NBC. The race was won by Oxbow.  The post time of the race was 6:18 p.m. EDT. The race was the 12th race on a card of 13 races. The Maryland Jockey Club reported total attendance of 117,203, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2013.\n\nPayout\nThe 138th Preakness Payout Schedule\n$2 Exacta: (6-9) $301.40\n$2 Trifecta: (6-9-5) $2,061.60\n$1 Superfecta: (6-9-5-1) $1,817.80\n\nField\n2013 Kentucky Derby winner Orb as expected entered the Preakness. It was announced on May 6 that Vyjack and Normandy Invasion would also be starting in The Preakness. Other Derby starters confirmed for The Preakness are Goldencents (17th) and the D. Wayne Lukas trained duo of Oxbow (6th) and Will Take Charge (8th). Later connections of Vyjack and Normandy Invasion withdrew their nominations. Horses that did not start in the Kentucky Derby and were nominated include Illinois Derby winner Departing, Sunland Derby winner Govenor Charlie and Titletown Five.Nine 3-year-olds were entered for the 138th Preakness Stakes.  The post position draw was held at the International Pavilion in the Pimlico Infield at 6 p.m. on May 15, 2013 and were broadcast live on Horse Racing TV using a blind draw. After the draw Orb was installed as the even money favorite, securing the rail.\n\nRace\nOn the day of the race,of five furlongs on the turf held  as part of the undercard for the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes annually during the third week of May at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland.   The race offers a purse of $100,000.The Jim McKay Turf Sprint is the lead off leg of the Mid Atlantic Thoroughbred Championships Sprint Turf Division or MATCh Races.  MATCh is a series of five races in five separate thoroughbred divisions run throughout four Mid-Atlantic States including; Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park Racecourse in Maryland; Delaware Park Racetrack in Delaware; Parx, Philadelphia Park and Presque Isle Downs in Pennsylvania and Monmouth Park in New Jersey.\n\nRace name\nThe race was named in honor of James Kenneth McManus (1921-2008), better known by his professional name of Jim McKay, was an American television sports journalist. McKay is best known for hosting ABC's Wide World of Sports (1961–1998). McKay covered a wide variety of special events, including horse races such as the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, golf events such as the British Open, and the Indianapolis 500.\n\nHistory\nThe Jim McKay Turf Sprint was first run in 2006 as the Baltimore Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint. In 2007, it ran as the Baltimore City Turf Sprint and in 2008 the race was known as the Old Mutual Turf Sprint. The stakes record is held by Heros Reward, who won the race in 2007 in a time of :55.90 over five furlongs.\n\nRecords\nSpeed record: \n\n5 furlongs - 55 4/5 - Hero's Reward  (2007)Most wins by a horse:\n\n5 - Ben's Cat (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 & 2016)Most wins by a jockey:\n\n3 - Julian Pimentel (2013, 2014 & 2015)Most wins by a trainer:\n\n5 - King T.

Although primarily a sports video game, Horse Racing received Mattel's \"Gaming Network\" branding, due to its pari-mutuel betting on horses during the game.\nThe game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables at a fictional western Kentucky race track called Plympton Downs (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton).  Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match).  These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbers—unlike in regular horse racing).\nHorse Racing was also released by Sears for their Intellivision private-label clone, the Super Video Arcade.\n\nGameplay\nIn Intellivision's original Horse Racing game, 6 players (bettors) begin each of the 10 races on the simulated match program by checking out the race program screen; 4 horses are entered for each race, with bettors starting out with a $750 simulated bankroll.  For each of the 4 horses entered into a race, the odds—along with past performances—are listed (accessed by a side action button during placing bets).  Each bettor then keys in his/her player number (from 1 to 6 on the keypad), enters a bet pay amount against \nhis/her bankroll, then—places the bet (of a win or exacta only—by pressing [9] on the keypad) on his/her selection of horse(s).  After all bets are made, a keypad press of [0] then [ENTER] starts the race.\nThe call to the post then plays.  After a brief silence, the starting gate opens up, and 4 Thoroughbred horses run away from the gate.  During the actual race, the disk/joystick is used to move a horse along, while the side action buttons perform either of 2 functions (top to coax a horse along, bottom to whip it).  Each race takes place on any of 3 different types of track:  dry, turf (grass), or muddy; additionally, the races run in length from 3 to 10 furlongs.  After the horses cross the finish line, the results are shown on the tote board as colorful horse heads (reading from right to left in finishing order), along with the elapsed time of the race.  The play screen then switches to the bet placing screen for the next race; after the full 10-race match program has run, a final GAME OVER screen shows up, with the bettors' final bankroll amounts.\nThe track is horizontally scrolling, with its color changing according to the racing surface (khaki for dry, pine green for turf, and brown for muddy). A 4-stall starting gate with the horses loaded therein is shown at the start of each race.  The cheering crowd fanfare sound is played as the horses cross the finish line.\n\nThe Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables\nThe RTS is a fictional stable in where the race horses featured in the game are housed.  Each horse has differing abilities and personalities.  These are referred to by their colors (unlike in actual horse races where they would get entrant post position numbers in relation to the inner rail).  These are assigned a button on the keypad as follows:\n\n[1] PINK — Pink Lady\n[2] RED — Red Devil\n[3] ORANGE — Sun Shine Shake\n[4] YELLOW — Gold Torts\n[5] GREEN — Green Goblin\n[6] BLUE — Blue Boy\n[7] VIOLET (PURPLE) — Grape Ghost\n[8] WHITE — Snowy GuyOn the original prototype ROM, there was a BLACK horse called Black Maurauder; however, he got dropped from the original release of the game, and got replaced by Snowy Guy.\n\nLegacy\nHorse Racing is included in the Intellivision Lives! game collection.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nRoman Brady\nRoman Brady is a fictional character from the long-running NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives. The role was originated in 1981 by Wayne Northrop, who played the role until 1984 and from 1991 to 1994, and is currently being portrayed by series veteran Josh Taylor, who stepped into the role in 1997. Roman is a member of the fictional Brady family, and has been a central character on the show since his introduction in 1981. Over the years, Roman has been involved in a number of storylines, including romances, family conflicts, and mystery plots.\n\nCasting\nThe role was originated on December 8, 1981, by Wayne Northrop. Northrop departed from the series on November 26, 1984, and the character was killed off during a battle with his arch-nemesis, international criminal mastermind Stefano DiMera. On November 27, 1985, the series introduced a character known as The Pawn, an amnesiac mystery man ostensibly controlled by Stefano but now in the custody of Stefano's rival and local businessman/mobster Victor Kiriakis. The role was portrayed by Robert Poynton until January 20, 1986, though the character's face is wrapped in bandages. On January 23, 1986, The Pawn's bandages were finally removed as Drake Hogestyn made his first appearance as John Black, a character with no memory of his past or knowledge of his real identity. In May 1986, Hogestyn's character of John is revealed to be Roman who had been treated to extensive brainwashing and plastic surgery courtesy of Stefano, and Hogestyn played the role written as Roman until 1991. When Northrop returned as Roman on August 30, 1991, the character that Hogestyn had been portraying for five years was retconned to be an entirely separate character that had been brainwashed to believe he was Roman Brady. Northrop once again departed from the series on August 2, 1994. On July 18, 1997, Josh Taylor appeared in the role as a recast of Roman Brady. The casting was met with criticism due to Taylor's previous portrayal of Chris Kositchek, one of Roman and Marlena's closest friends. Northrop was later recast as another new character, Dr. Alex North, and scenes from Northrop's time playing Roman were edited to create the new character's backstory.\n\nCharacterization\nRoman is the retired police commissioner of the fictional Midwestern town of Salem, and currently manages and tends bar at his family's business, the Brady Pub. He is also a former agent of the fictional International Security Alliance (ISA), a spy agency focused on all sorts of unusually high-level global conspiracies that tended to center around his otherwise-quiet home town. During his portrayal by Northrop, he was established as a top-notch cop but also a bit of a renegade, often accepting deep-cover assignments, and a master of disguise (similar to Sherlock Holmes). Hogestyn's character was more by-the-book on the job, although still dangerous with a dark side somewhat characteristic of an ex-spy (which later fed into the \"John Black\" persona), with expertise in Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do, and a little more of a ladies' man. Taylor's portrayal is more that of a \"regular guy\", with a bit less intrigue and more straightforward professionally, although still with an eye for the ladies and more inclined to engage in one-night stands with various women than the character as portrayed by Northrop or Hogestyn (such as with Kate Roberts, Billie Reed, ex-wives Anna DiMera and Marlena Evans, and a strongly hinted at – but never confirmed – rendezvous with Nicole Walker).\nOver the years, much has been made of the creation (and constant retcon of the backstory) of Hogestyn's character John Black as an entirely separate character than that of Roman Brady, especially after the show had invested over five years in establishing John's identity as Roman, complete with a plausible backstory (and flashbacks) of his “time away” (while he was being held captive, brainwashed, and trained—-unsuccessfully—-to be an assassin by Stefano DiMera), and \"Roman's\" reemerging memories. However, with Roman's recasts and changes in characterization over the years (while John has consistently been played by Hogestyn), in hindsight it can be said that it was actually John Black that remained more true to the original \"Roman\" persona, and that it was Roman that was gradually developed into a separate character. This was especially illustrated in 2016 when Roman, who had always been a straight-shooter with regard to the law, became complicit in the cover-up of sister-in-law Hope Brady's murder of Stefano DiMera, who she wrongly believed was responsible for the disappearance and later death of her husband (and Roman's brother) Bo Brady.\n\nStorylines\n1981–84\nRoman Brady first appeared on Days to protect Marlena Evans from a serial killer. He slept on her floor. The chemistry between the actors, and the characters, led to love. In 1983 on Days of Our Lives, Roman and Marlena were married. Over the next year Roman became embroiled in a storyline with Stefano DiMera. Stefano was a powerful and ruthless business tycoon (and organized crime figure) from Europe who had come to town to set up shop in Salem, and Roman being the city's top cop had gone after him. Subsequently Stefano framed Roman for serial killings that were being committed by his nephew Andre DiMera. At the time Marlena saw Roman killing a woman. Later it was shown that Andre had used a realistic mask. Roman was jailed. Mrs. Alice Horton baked him some drugged doughnuts, and on the way to the hospital Roman escaped. He went on the run to prove his innocence, and he accomplished that. He was promoted, and Stefano was on the run.\nIn November 1984, Roman tracked Stefano to a Caribbean island where many other characters had crash-landed, too. Stefano was suffering from incurable cancer, and needed to collect three mysterious prisms to unlock a secret formula to cure himself. Roman caught up to him on a cliff, but Stefano pulled a gun. He shot Roman, who seemingly fell to his death. His brother Bo cradled him in his arms on the beach, but had to leave him for a few minutes. When he returned the body was gone. Bo assumed that while he was away, the tide had come in and washed Roman’s body out to sea, for which Bo blamed himself for years. Several episodes later Roman was shown aboard Stefano's yacht, motionless.\n\n1986–1990\nIn 1986 an amnesiac known only as \"The Pawn\" appeared in Salem on January 23, 1986. He assumed the name \"John Black\" after reading it on a Vietnam War memorial in Salem. Eventually the character-bono bases in support of the principle termed Net Neutrality. The fight was led by the International Documentary Association and was supported by such additional organizations as Film Independent, University Film & Video Association, Independent Filmmaker Project, Independent Feature Project Chicago, IFP Minnesota and National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture.\nOn January 2, 2011, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality in a 3-to-2 vote.\n\nLee & William Storey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue\nIn support of the documentary film community's tax status, Donaldson, along with his firm's team of attorneys, prepared an amicus brief on a pro-bono basis urging the United States Tax Court to recognize that documentary films are overwhelmingly undertaken in the pursuit of a profit. It was filed in response to the Internal Revenue Service's challenge of filmmaker Lee Storey's business expenses associated with his documentary Smile ‘Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story.\nDuring Storey's March 2011 trial, a judge expressed an inclination to hold that documentaries are intended to “educate and expose” rather than make a profit.\nIf documentary filmmaking were to be viewed by the IRS as merely a means to persuade or entertain – and not intended to turn a profit – documentarians would no longer be able to claim deductions incurred in the production of such films.On Thursday, April 19, 2012, U.S. Tax Court Judge Diane L. Kroupa recognized documentary filmmaking as a legitimate business and ruled that Storey can write off the entirety of her filmmaking losses, which were in the amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nJudge Learned Hand\nOn May 5, 2013, Los Angeles Review of Books – an online literary review journal that covers the American and international book scene – published Donaldson's review of the book Reason and Imagination: the Selected Correspondence of Learned Hand, a collection of Judge Learned Hand's personal letters. Aside from a few members of the US Supreme Court, Hand is the most-quoted judge in American history. In his extensive, 2700-word review, Donaldson describes the book as \"a sweeping retelling of American history from one of its most intelligent, dispassionate participants.\"\n\nEscape from Tomorrow\nDonaldson was the key proponent in assuring the film Escape from Tomorrow fell under the fair-use doctrine and was insurable.\nEscape from Tomorrow premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013. The film was shot entirely guerilla-style at Disney World and Disneyland without obtaining permission from the parks. The issue with getting the movie insured was not merely that it was shot secretly inside the parks, but that the movie is a parody of Disney that portrays a “darker” side, which goes against the company brand.In order to get the movie insured, Donaldson issued an opinion letter to the insurance company presenting a case for fair use, trademark, public domain, and access issues. The opinion letter was the longest that his office had ever written; it took 4 months to assemble. The E&O insurance policy was issued in the standard time of one week. The film was released to theaters and video on October 11, 2013.\n\nThe Central Park Five\nDonaldson worked alongside New York attorney Andrew Cielli to prepare and file an amicus brief on behalf of documentary filmmakers Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, and David McMahon, who produced the documentary The Central Park Five. The brief was supported by the International Documentary Association, NAMAC, and Film Independent.The Central Park Five chronicles the story of five men wrongfully accused of raping a Central Park jogger in 1989. They were later exonerated after another man confessed and provided DNA evidence. Eight years later the wrongfully accused filed a 50 million dollar lawsuit against the state of New York, claiming their confessions were coerced and their case was mishandled. In its defense, the state of New York attempted to obtain outtakes from the film, claiming the documentarians forfeited their journalistic privilege because they advocated on behalf of the subjects of the documentary.Donaldson fought for the filmmakers, arguing that preservation of journalistic privilege is essential in order for documentarians’ work to be effective, despite how the story was discovered or how passionately they advocate for their subjects. On February 19, 2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis ruled in favor of the documentary filmmakers preserving their journalistic privilege.\n\nOrphan works legislation\nOn April 2, 2014, Donaldson testified before the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, DC on behalf of the Independent Documentary Association and Film Independent on the subject of orphan works. Orphan words are copyrighted works whose owners cannot be contacted or found despite a diligent search. Donaldson's testimony urged Congress to consider documentary and independent filmmakers when crafting new legislation on orphan works since, under current law, filmmakers are at risk of being hit with huge damages when using unlicensed material, no matter how diligent a search for the owners.\n\nAs an author\nDonaldson's Clearance & Copyright: Everything the Independent Filmmaker Needs to Know is used as a textbook in over 50 college and university film schools across America. He is also the author of Negotiating for Dummies, which has been translated into 9 languages, as well as Do It Yourself! Trademarks & Copyrights and Fearless Negotiating: The Wish, Want, Walk Method To Reaching Agreements That Work.\nIn 2010, Donaldson released The American Bar Association's Legal Guide To Independent Filmmaking, which he co-authored with his partner Lisa A. Callif.\n\nRecognition\nDonaldson was honored with the International Documentary Association's Amicus Award in 2009. He was included in The Hollywood Reporter's \"Power Lawyers\" list in 2010 and 2011. In 2012 he was included in Variety's Legal Impact Report 2012: Game-Changing Attorneys. And he was selected as a Super Lawyer in 2009, 2012 and 2013.\n\nBibliography\nThe E-Z Legal Guide to Trademarks & Copyrights (1995)\nDo It Yourself!

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJohn Fulton (instrument maker)\nJohn Fulton (1803–1853) was a Scottish instrument maker who originally trained as a cobbler. He built three orrerys in a workshop attached to at his home, now demolished, in the Kirton Brae area of Fenwick and was eventually appointed instrument maker to King William IV, moving to London, but retiring to Fenwick. He is buried in the Fenwick Kirk graveyard.\n\nLife\nIt is recorded that John's father, also a cobbler, was a subscribing member to the library set up in the village by the Fenwick Weavers. With access to this library, John pursued his interest in astronomy, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines that led to his career as an instrument maker of outstanding ability and achievement. Largely self-taught, he studied botany, learned several foreign languages, constructed a ‘velocipede’ or early bicycle, and experimented with the production of coal gas. He had left school at the age of 13.\n\nOrrerys\nAstronomy held a particular fascination for him, so much so that he was prompted to construct, in his spare time in the years between 1823 and 1833, three working models of the solar system, known as orrerys. The third of these is now on display in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum: it was the most intricate and took him four years to finish. It measured 1000mm x 3000mm x 3000mm. Entirely his own work, it has 175 wheels and more than 200 moving parts and is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world. The Society of Arts, who awarded him a silver medal, calculated that his third orrery was the most perfect built up to that time.Fulton took the orrery on a tour of the United Kingdom. Such was the public interest that in 1869 a group of Glasgow businessmen led by William Walker bought the orrery for the city. It was brought up from London and then toured around Glasgow schools and museums until the 1930s when it found a more permanent home in the Old Glasgow Museum.A local story relates that Fulton 'borrowed' his grandmother’s candlesticks and melted them down to provide the brass for his first orrery model.\n\nJohn Fulton Memorial Hall\nThis is the public meeting hall for Fenwick, maintained by East Ayrshire Council. It was previously the Guthrie Memorial Free Church of 1844, and following a worldwide fund raising campaign sufficient funds had been raised by 1919 and the hall was opened in 1920. The hall is a Category C listed building.\nPassage 2:\nDavie Fulton\nEdmund Davie Fulton,  (March 10, 1916 – May 22, 2000) was a Canadian Rhodes Scholar, politician and judge. He was born in Kamloops, British Columbia, the son of politician/lawyer Frederick John Fulton and Winnifred M. Davie, daughter of A. E. B. Davie. He was the youngest of 4 children.\n\nMilitary career\nDavie Fulton served in the Second World War with the Canadian Army overseas as Platoon and Company Commander with Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, and as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in the Italian and Northwestern Europe campaigns. His brother John \"Moose\" Fulton distinguished himself in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He went missing in action in late 1942, and in 1943  Kamloops adopted the Moose Squadron in honour of its commander. In 1944 the Kamloops airport was dedicated as Fulton Field.\n\nPolitical career\nHe was brought home from the war by the Conservative Party and won a seat by 100 votes in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1945 general election.\nIn 1949 he introduced legislation to criminalize the publication, distribution, and sale of crime comics, as the result of a murder by two Yukon teens that was blamed on the influence of the crime comics which the perpetrators had read.He ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada at the 1956 leadership convention, placing third behind John Diefenbaker.\nWhen Diefenbaker led the party to victory in the 1957 election, he appointed Fulton to Cabinet as Minister of Justice. As Minister, Fulton was involved in negotiations to patriate the Canadian Constitution, and developed the \"Fulton–Favreau formula\". In 1962, he became Minister of Public Works. His cousin, Albert McPhillips, was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries around this time.\nHe resigned from Cabinet in 1963, when he decided to leave federal politics and take the leadership of the British Columbia Progressive Conservative Party. His efforts to revive the provincial Tories in BC were a failure, and he returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 election.\nFulton stood as a candidate at the 1967 federal PC leadership convention, and placed third behind Robert Stanfield and Dufferin Roblin.\nAfter losing his seat in the 1968 election, he retired from politics and returned to the law. In 1973, he became a justice on the British Columbia Supreme Court, and served until 1981. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a commissioner on the International Joint Commission.\nIn 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He died in Vancouver on May 22, 2000.\n\nElection results\nArchives\nThere is a Davie Fulton fonds at Library and Archives Canada.\nPassage 3:\nHarry the Kid\nHarry Head (died 1881) (known as Harry the Kid), was a cattle rustler and stagecoach robber. One of his better known robberies occurred outside Contention City, a boomtown in the Arizona Territory.\n\nDrew Station Stagecoach Robbery\nOn March 15, 1881, Head and three of his known Cowboy companions, Bill Leonard, Jim Crane, and Luther King, were set to rob a Wells Fargo stagecoach. The monetary gain, however, wasn't the only motive for robbing the stagecoach. Killing Bob Paul was reportedly a secondary objective. Paul had been sent out with the stagecoach to prevent robberies from occurring, riding shotgun. Two well-known local families during the time, the Clantons and the Earps, are rumored to have had an interest in trying to kill Paul.The coach was carrying 26,000 dollars and eight passengers. Twelve miles from the stagecoach's final destination, Paul changed seats with the driver of the stagecoach, which temporarily brought the stagecoach to a halt. Shortly after the change of seats the stagecoach came to a part of the road that had a very steep grade. This was where Head and the others laid in ambush. In order to conceal their identities, the stagecoach robbersthe catalogue raisonné, which is updated as additional Folinsbee works are identified.\n\nSelected works\nLandscapes\nPoughkeepsie Bridge (1914), private collection.

The name of this section comes from the fact that each way of the expressway runs near a different waterfront of the Tietê River. It is a very important road of São Paulo, connecting the East, North and West portions of the city, and linking the Lapa neighbourhood and the Penha neighbourhood. It provides access to the Castelo Branco highway, the Bandeirantes highway, the Anhangüera highway, the Presidente Dutra highway, the Fernão Dias highway, the Ayrton Senna highway and the São Paulo International Airport.

Marie, Michigan\nSault Ste. Marie ( SOO-saynt-mə-REE) is a city in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the county seat of Chippewa County and is the only city within the county. With a population of 13,337 at the 2020 census, it is the second-most populated city in the Upper Peninsula, behind Marquette. It is the primary city of the Sault Ste. Marie, MI Micropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Chippewa County and had a population of 36,785 at the 2020 census. Sault Ste. Marie was settled by Europeans in 1668, making it the oldest city in Michigan.Sault Ste. Marie is located along the St. Marys River, which flows from Lake Superior to Lake Huron and forms part of the United States–Canada border. Across the river is the larger Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada; the two cities are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge. Between the two cities are the Soo Locks, a set of locks allowing ship travel between Lake Superior and the Lower Great Lakes.        \nSault Ste. Marie is home to Lake Superior State University.\n\nHistory\nFor centuries, Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ (Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda), or Sioux, people lived in the area. Around the 1300s, the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) began to move in from the East Coast, gradually pushing the Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ westward. They called the area Baawitigong (\"at the cascading rapids\"), after the rapids of St. Marys River. French colonists renamed the region Saulteaux (\"rapids\" in French). The Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ came to call the Anishinaabe \"Ḣaḣaṭuƞwaƞ\", or \"Dwellers of the Falls.\"\nIn 1668, French missionaries Claude Dablon and Jacques Marquette founded a Jesuit mission at this site. Sault Ste. Marie developed as one of oldest European city in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains, and the oldest permanent European settlement in Michigan. On June 4, 1671, Simon-François Daumont de Saint-Lusson, a colonial agent, was dispatched from Quebec to the distant tribes, proposing a congress of Indian nations at the Falls of St. Mary between Lake Huron and Lake Superior. Trader Nicolas Perrot helped attract the principal chiefs, and representatives of 14 Indigenous nations were invited for the elaborate ceremony. The French officials proclaimed France's appropriation of the immense territory surrounding Lake Superior in the name of King Louis XIV.In the 18th century, the settlement became an important center of the fur trade, when it was a post for the British-owned North West Company, based in Montreal. The fur trader John Johnston, a Scots-Irish immigrant from Belfast, was considered the first European settler in 1790. He married a high-ranking Ojibwe woman named Ozhaguscodaywayquay, the daughter of a prominent chief, Waubojeeg. She also became known as Susan Johnston. Their marriage was one of many alliances in the northern areas between high-ranking European traders and Ojibwe. The family was prominent among Native Americans, First Nations, and Europeans from both Canada and the United States. They had eight children who learned fluent Ojibwe, English and French. The Johnstons entertained a variety of trappers, explorers, traders, and government officials, especially during the years before the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States.For more than 140 years, the settlement was a single community under French colonial, and later, British colonial rule. After the War of 1812, a US–UK Joint Boundary Commission finally fixed the border in 1817 between the Michigan Territory of the US and the British Province of Upper Canada to follow the river in this area. Whereas traders had formerly moved freely through the whole area, the United States forbade Canadian traders from operating in the United States, which reduced their trade and disrupted the area's economy. The American and Canadian communities of Sault Ste. Marie were each incorporated as independent municipalities toward the end of the 19th century.As a result of the fur trade, the settlement attracted Ojibwe and Ottawa, Métis, and ethnic Europeans of various nationalities. It was a two-tiered society, with fur traders (who had capital) and their families and upper-class Ojibwe in the upper echelon. In the aftermath of the War of 1812, however, the community's society changed markedly.The U.S. built Fort Brady near the settlement, introducing new troops and settlers, mostly Anglo-American. The UK and the US settled on a new northern boundary in 1817, dividing the US and Canada along St. Mary's River. The US prohibited British fur traders from operating in the United States. After completion of the Erie Canal in New York State in 1825 (expanded in 1832), the number of settlers migrating to Ohio and Michigan increased dramatically from New York and New England, bringing with them the Yankee culture of the Northern Tier. Their numbers overwhelmed the cosmopolitan culture of the earlier settlers. They practiced more discrimination against Native Americans and Métis.\nThe falls proved a choke point for shipping between the Great Lakes. Early ships traveling to and from Lake Superior were portaged around the rapids in a lengthy process (much like moving a house) that could take weeks. Later, only the cargoes were unloaded, hauled around the rapids, and then loaded onto other ships waiting below the rapids. The first American lock, the State Lock, was built in 1855; it was instrumental in improving shipping. The lock has been expanded and improved over the years.\nIn 1900, Northwestern Leather Company opened a tannery in Sault Ste. Marie. The tannery was founded to process leather for the upper parts of shoes, which was finer than that for soles.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLewiston Maineiacs\nThe Lewiston Maineiacs were a junior ice hockey team of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League based in Lewiston, Maine, United States. The team played its home games at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée.  They were the second QMJHL team in the United States, and the only one to play a full season. They won the President's Cup in 2007, becoming the only American based franchise to accomplish the feat.\nOn May 31, 2011, the QMJHL decided to fold the team following eight years of financial losses.\n\nHistory\nTheir franchise was granted for the 1969–70 season. They played in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, from 1969 to 1992. They were known as the Ducs from 1969 to 1973, and as the Draveurs from 1973 to 1992. They moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1992 to become the Faucons (1992–1998) and the Castors (1998–2003). The Castors moved to Lewiston, Maine, in 2003.\nThe MAINEiacs clinched the Jean Rougeau Trophy for first overall in the regular season for 2006–07. During the same season, Lewiston increased its annual attendance totals to 94,903 tickets sold. In the playoffs that year, Lewiston went 16–1 to cruise to their first President's Cup.\n\n2007 Memorial Cup\nAfter winning the 2007 President's Cup, the MAINEiacs won eligibility to play in the 2007 Memorial Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia. Following an opening win over the Medicine Hat Tigers, the MAINEiacs suffered a huge loss with the injury of their captain, Marc-André Cliche, and never really found their scoring touch. They crashed out of the tournament in fourth place after losing consecutive games to the Vancouver Giants, Plymouth Whalers, and the Whalers again in the tie-breaker, scoring only three goals in three games in the process.\n\nScoresSaturday, May 19: Lewiston 3, Medicine Hat Tigers 1\nSunday, May 20: Vancouver Giants 2, Lewiston 1\nTuesday, May 22: Plymouth Whalers 2, Lewiston 1 (OT)\nThursday, May 24: Plymouth Whalers 5, Lewiston 1\n\nSale and aborted relocation\nOn January 25, 2009, it was announced that the MAINEiacs were negotiating with the city of Boisbriand, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal), in hopes of relocating the franchise for the 2009–10 season. Under the plan, Mark Just would remain majority owner with 51% of the shares, with former NHL defenseman Joel Bouchard owning the rest. On January 31, the team announced that they had filed their intent to relocate, and had submitted papers to do so to the QMJHL.\nIn a January 31 media release announcing the move of the MAINEiacs franchise, owner Mark Just said that community support for the team was a major consideration. During the six seasons since the team moved from Sherbrooke, Quebec, to Lewiston, the MAINEiacs never managed to break even. However, on February 2, Farrel Miller, owner of the QMJHL's Montreal Junior Hockey Club, issued a statement that his team would fight the MAINEiacs move to Boisbriand on territorial grounds.\n\nThe Montreal Junior Hockey Club has communicated to the QMJHL that it will retain, without modification, its exclusive geographic territory that it acquired in connection with its 2008 Franchise Agreement with the QMJHL. On January 21, 2009, the Montreal Junior Hockey Club communicated to the Governors of the QMJHL that (i) it has chosen to retain its exclusive territory without modification and (ii) that it is not seeking any financial compensation in connection with this issue.After several weeks of negotiations with a number of Canadian cities (most notably Fredericton, New Brunswick), MAINEiacs Head Coach Don Macadam announced on March 24, 2009, that the MAINEiacs would be remaining in Lewiston. In June 2010, Lewiston businessman Paul Spellman became minority owner of the team, and in early August 2010, former Moncton Wildcats General Manager Bill Schurman was named as the team's Sports Management Consultant.  However, relocation rumors continued to follow the team, with Summerside, Prince Edward Island (where Schurman, a native of that town, had recently been the municipality's Director of Community Services), and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, named as a potential destinations in January 2011.\nSchurman's denials of the team looking into a Summerside relocation proved unconvincing, and the rumours had a negative effect on attendance. However, Schurman's dream of moving the MAINEiacs to his home city ultimately failed, as a preliminary exploration to gauge support for a move to Summerside found little traction. The team then began to look at other possibilities, but found that few other relocation options existed.\nThe Lewiston franchise was disbanded by the QMJHL in the summer of 2011. To replace the defunct MAINEiacs club, the Sherbrooke Phoenix were scheduled to begin play for the 2012–13 season, the 3rd franchise to call Sherbrooke home in 25 years.\n\nTakeover by league and disbanding\nOn May 31, 2011, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League held a conference call to prepare an offer to purchase the team from Mark Just for 3.5 million dollars. Under the league's plan, the MAINEiacs would then be disbanded, with players being selected by other clubs in a dispersal draft. Late on May 31, the league issued a press release confirming the sale of the MAINEiacs to the league, and the subsequent disbanding / dispersal draft occurred the following week. Colisee stated they would search for a replacement team from outside of the QMJHL to take the MAINEiacs place.The City of Lewiston and the Androscoggin Bank Colisee would end up getting the American Hockey League's Portland Pirates to move to the Colisee for the 2013-14 season after disputing their lease with the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland. Starting in 2019, the NAHL Maine Nordiques and their partner organization, the NA3HL Lewiston-Auburn Nordiques, began play at the Colisee.\n\nCoaches\nMario Durocher: 2003–04\nClément Jodoin: 2004–2007\nEd Harding: 2007 – January 12, 2009\nDon MacAdam: January 13, 2009 –.e. paystubs or tax returns), and must sign an affidavit of financial hardship\nProperty owner occupancy status will be verified through borrower credit report and other documentation; no investor-owned, vacant, or condemned properties\nIncentives to lenders and servicers to modify at risk borrowers who have not yet missed payments when the servicer determines that the borrower is at imminent risk of default\nModifications can start from now until December 31, 2016; loans can be modified only once under the program\n\nLoan modification terms and procedures\nParticipating servicers are required to service all eligible loans under the rules of the program unless explicitly prohibited by contract; servicers are required to use reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of limits on participation.\nParticipating loan servicers will be required to use a net present value (NPV) test on each loan that is at risk of imminent default or at least 60 days delinquent. The NPV test will compare the net present value of cash flows with modification and without modification. If the test is positive: meaning that the net present value of expected cash flow is greater in the modification scenario: the servicer must modify absent fraud or a contract prohibition.\nParameters of the NPV test are spelled out in the guidelines, including acceptable discount rates, property valuation methodologies, home price appreciation assumptions, foreclosure costs and timelines, and borrower cure and redefault rate assumptions.\nServicers will follow a specified sequence of steps in order to reduce the monthly payment to no more than 31% of gross monthly income (DTI).\nThe modification sequence requires first reducing the interest rate for trial period of 3–9 months(subject to a rate floor of 2%), then if necessary extending the term or amortization of the loan up to a maximum of 40 years, and then if necessary forbearing principal. Principal forgiveness or a Hope for Homeowners refinancing are acceptable alternatives.\nIt is noteworthy that this interest rate is not fixed, and will generally increase 1%/year until it reaches what ever the current rate is 5 years after the modification. Often it includes a balloon payment at the end of the first 5 years.  This practice has been found controversial by many in the financial world as it is expected to bring about a slurry of new foreclosures in 5 years when homeowners will once again not be able to pay their mortgage due to the interest rate hike, or the balloon payment.\nThe monthly payment includes principal, interest, taxes, insurance, flood insurance, homeowner's association and/or condominium fees. Monthly income includes wages, salary, overtime, fees, commissions, tips, social security, pensions, and all other income.\nServicers must enter into the program agreements with Treasury's financial agent on or before December 31, 2009.\n\nPayments to servicers, lenders, and responsible borrowers\nThe Program will share with the lender/investor the cost of reductions in monthly payments from 38% DTI to 31% DTI.\nServicers that modify loans according to the guidelines will receive an up-front fee of $1,000 for each modification, plus “pay for success” fees on still-performing loans of $1,000 per year.\nHomeowners who make their payments on time are eligible for up to $1,000 of principal reduction payments each year for up to five years.\nThe program will provide one-time bonus incentive payments of $1,500 to lender/investors and $500 to servicers for modifications made while a borrower is still current on mortgage payments.\nThe program will include incentives for extinguishing second liens on loans modified under this program.\nNo payments will be made under the program to the lender/investor, servicer, or borrower unless and until the servicer has first entered into the program agreements with Treasury's financial agent.\nSimilar incentives will be paid for Hope for Homeowner refinances.\n\nTransparency and accountability\nMeasures to prevent and detect fraud, such as documentation and audit requirements, will be central to the program.\nServicers will be required to collect, maintain and transmit records for verification and compliance review, including borrower eligibility, underwriting, incentive payments, property verification, and other documentation.\nFreddie Mac is appointed the compliance officer of the program.\n\nWarnings to people looking to apply for program\nForeclosure rescue and mortgage modification scams are a growing problem. Homeowners must protect themselves so they do not lose money or their home.  Scammers make promises that they cannot keep, such as guarantees to “save” your home or lower your mortgage, often for a fee. Scammers may pretend that they have direct contact with your mortgage servicer when they do not.Even amongst reputable refinance organizations, the fundamental education of the house owner is not stressed.  Some may even request struggling homeowners to pledge their time to become politically active.  The controversy exists between personal integrity and the concept of a 'right to homeownership'.  Many euphemisms are used to implicitly stress the concept that homeownership is not the result of a lifetime of effort but a government-given right.  These euphemisms like \"HOPE, relief and Save-the-Dream\" as used above in naming or implementing the loan modification programs.  The origins of the word 'mortgage' is a death pledge—a concept that perhaps even exceeds the common view of personal integrity.  At the foundation of homeownership should be a personal long-term commitment to pay the terms of the mortgage.  On the bankers side of the contract, their business model is regulated by the 'social good' which are implemented by government by chartering banks.  If the banks implement policies that lead to financial bubbles and panics, a democratic government is equipped with the tools to uncharter and redistribute a banks assets.Bank crisis in the united states\n\nFree resources for potential applicants\nThere are free resources available for potential applicants.  \n\nHomeowners can call the Homeowner's HOPE Hotline at 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) for information about the Making Home Affordable Program and to speak with a HUD approved housing counselor.

Ingredients used in its preparation in addition to ripe avocados can include milk, cream, half-and-half or buttermilk, soup stock or broth, water, lime juice, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Additional ingredients used can include onions, shallots, garlic, hot sauce, cilantro, red pepper, cayenne pepper and cumin, and water can be used to thin the soup. It is enjoyed widely in areas of Mexico as a classic dish.\nThe avocados are typically puréed or mashed, and sliced, diced or cubed avocado can be used as a garnish. Additional garnishes can include sliced lime, sour cream, chives, crab meat, shrimp and salsa fresca. It can be prepared and served as a cold or hot soup.Avocado soup's color can change as time passes because oxidation causes avocados to brown, but this does not affect the soup's flavor. It can be a relatively easy dish to prepare that does not require a great deal of time.\n\nSee also\nAvocado § Culinary uses\nList of avocado dishes\nList of cold soups\nList of soups\nPassage 2:\nLettuce soup\nLettuce soup is a soup prepared with lettuce as a primary ingredient. It may be prepared with myriad lettuces and other ingredients, and some lettuce soups may use several cultivars of lettuce in their preparation. It is a part of French cuisine and Chinese cuisine. Cream of lettuce soup is a type of lettuce soup prepared using milk or cream. The soup may be served with toast or rolls as a side dish or with the soup atop them. It may be served as an appetizer, a side dish or as a main dish, and may be served hot or cold.\n\nPreparation\nLettuce is a primary ingredient, and several types of lettuce can be used, such as butter lettuce, cos lettuce, Boston lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce and iceberg lettuce, among others. The lettuce may be chopped, torn, shredded or sliced into ribbons. Additional ingredients may include, but are not limited to, chicken stock, beef stock, cream, milk, wine, lemon juice, egg or egg yolk, meats, rice, potato, greens, sorrel, watercress, Swiss chard, escarole, peas, parsley/dried parsley, bread crumbs, onion, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper, among others. Some preparations purée all of the ingredients together, and some preparations are strained in a sieve. Lettuce soup is sometimes served with toast or rolls, either as a side dish or with the soup poured upon it. Sometimes croutons or chopped bacon are used in the dish or to garnish it. In French cuisine, lettuce soup is usually served poured atop thin slices of lightly toasted French bread. Some versions are served cold. Total calories can vary depending on the ingredients used. For example, versions that use milk may have fewer calories than those that use cream.\n\nDishes\nChinese versions include Cantonese dishes such as \"minced chicken with lettuce soup\" and \"fish with lettuce soup\".\n\nSee also\nLettuce sandwich\nList of Chinese soups\nList of French soups and stews\nList of soups\nList of vegetable soups\nPassage 3:\nSpinach soup\nSpinach soup is a soup prepared using spinach as a primary ingredient. A common dish around the world, the soup can be prepared as a broth-based or cream-based soup, and the latter can be referred to as \"cream of spinach soup.\" In China, a spinach and tofu soup is also known as \"emerald and white jade soup\"; spinach and tofu represent emerald and white jade respectively, and thus the spinach soup itself can be called \"emerald soup\". Fresh, canned or frozen spinach can be used, and the spinach can be used whole, puréed or chopped. Additional ingredients can include onion, green onion, carrot, celery, tomatoes, potatoes, lemon juice, olive oil, seasonings, salt and pepper. Spinach soup is typically served hot, but can also be served as a cold soup. Prior to being served, it can be topped or garnished with ingredients such as sour cream and crème fraîche.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPassage 4:\nSpring soup\nSpring soup is a soup made with ingredients that are only in season for a short period during spring. Although asparagus largely characterizes spring soup, spring soup may include just about any spring vegetable added to a broth, chowder, or bisque. Spring soup is popular largely because it includes fresh ingredients not seen for a while by the consumer.\n\nCharacteristics\nWhere winter soups are hearty to \"warm and fortify\", spring soups aim to celebrate \"new skies and freshness\" by being \"delicate and light, pretty and promising.\" Spring soups need lighter, brighter tastes and textures than their winter counterparts. A reason for this is that spring soups \"capture the essence of the season in a clean-tasting, refreshing broth that showcases the pure flavors\" of its ingredients.Ingredients used in spring soup include a purée of pea, asparagus, rapini, and fennel, with asparagus being considered the quintessential spring vegetable to largely characterize spring soup. Spring soups typically show a subtle green color to reflect spring.\n\nHistory\nIn 1828, The British Almanac provided housekeepers' information to add spring soup to a July menu. In 1896, the Holland Society of New York published a spring soup recipe that included amontillado, olives, almonds, chicken, and radishes. In 1898, spring soup was defined as a soup having a stock with any spring vegetables added that have first been parboiled in water, with the soup often colored with caramel.\n\nSee also\nList of vegetable soups\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nTidewater region\nTidewater refers to the north Atlantic Plain region of the United States.\n\nDefinition\nCulturally, the Tidewater region usually includes the low-lying plains of southeast Virginia, northeastern North Carolina, southern Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay. Speaking geographically, however, it covers about 50,000 square miles, from New York's Long Island in the north to the southernmost edge of North Carolina in the south, an area that includes the state of Delaware and the Delmarva Peninsula.\nThe cultural Tidewater region got its name from the effects of the changing tides on local rivers, sounds, and the ocean. The area has a centuries-old cultural heritage that sets the Tidewater region apart from the adjacent inland parts of the United States, especially with respect to its distincto and is often very spicy. Groundnut soup is also a native soup of the Benin (Edo) people in Nigeria and it is often eaten with pounded yam.  Some of the essential ingredients used in making it are Piper guineense (uziza seed) and Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaf).It is prepared from groundnut which is mashed into a paste, usually termed as groundnut paste. Groundnut soup is eaten with eba, fufu, banku, kenkey and so on. It is a delicacy that Nigerian, Ghanaian and people in other African countries consume, such as in Sierra Leone. In Ghana, it is known as nkatenkwan in Akan language.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPeanut stew\nPalm nut soup\nList of peanut dishes\nList of soups\nPassage 7:\nShe-crab soup\nShe-crab soup is a rich soup, similar to bisque, made of milk or heavy cream, crab or fish stock, Atlantic blue crab meat, and (traditionally) crab roe, and a small amount of dry sherry added as it is plated. It may be thickened either by heat reduction or with a purée of boiled rice; it may also include such seasonings as mace and shallots or onions.  The soup is a regional specialty from the South Carolina Lowcountry.  It is commonly featured on the menus of many Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia restaurants.The soup is named for the \"she-crab\", or female crab, originally a gravid (roe-carrying) crab, as the orange crab roe comprise a chief ingredient in traditional she-crab soup.  As with turtle soup, other ingredients may be added to the soup or substituted for others, although crabmeat is found in all versions.\nRegulations in Maryland and other states restrict the collection of egg-bearing female crabs.\n\nSee also\nPartan bree\nList of cream soups\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of soups\nPassage 8:\nSyodon\nSyodon is an extinct genus of dinocephalian therapsids that lived approximately 267-260 million years ago during the middle Permian period of the Paleozoic era. These therapsids, located in Russia  were initially believed to be true mammals.  Syodon was first named by Stephan Kutorga in 1838. The fossils of these synapsids were first discovered in the Molotov Province region of Russia in limestone beds with a high content of copper. However, scientists believe that these organisms likely come from higher rock beds due to increased specializations in their morphology.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Syodon is derived from Greek meaning pig's tooth. This name likely stemmed from the protruding canines similar to that of the lower canines of a wild boar.\n\nDiet\nSyodon is characterized as a carnivore, likely feeding on small-bodied prey.  They lack the ‘expansion of supraorbital bones over the orbits, which would act as a stress sink’ in certain hypercarniverous species such as thalattosuchian Dakosaurus. This thickened supraorbital regions also found in large theropods would have alleviated cranial stress used for feeding on large prey. Since this adaption is not found in Syodon it is thought they were limited to small animals and prey which they could easily consume with their limited jaw architecture.\n\nPaleobiology\nSyodon is characterized by possessing \"bulbous\" post-canines featuring significant wear facets in adults, whereas juveniles tend to have ‘bladelike’ post canines. The canine of Syodon is highly distinctive and allows it to be distinguished easily. They also possess a large, strongly curved ‘hook-like canine. Syodon also feature a set of smaller, replacement teeth out-of-place from the main palatine tooth row.The snout of Syodon is relatively long narrow compared to the rest of the body. The snout comprises approximately 1/4 the length of the skill. These synapsids reached 1.2 m (4 ft) in length.\n\nSee also\nList of therapsids\nArchaeosyodon\nMicrosyodon\nPassage 9:\nWatercress soup\nWatercress soup is a soup prepared using the leaf vegetable watercress as a primary ingredient. It may be prepared as a cream soup or as a broth/stock-based soup using vegetable or chicken stock. Additional ingredients used can include vegetables such as potato, leeks, spinach, celery and turnips, cheese, butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Watercress soup can be prepared as a puréed soup by mixing the ingredients in a food processor. It can be served hot or cold, and may be garnished with crème fraîche, shaved Parmesan cheese, drizzled olive oil and watercress leaves.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCabbage soup\nList of soups\nSpinach soup\nVegetable soup\nList of vegetable soups\nPassage 10:\n1996 PW\n1996 PW is an exceptionally eccentric trans-Neptunian object and damocloid on an orbit typical of long-period comets but one that showed no sign of cometary activity around the time it was discovered. The unusual object measures approximately 10 kilometers (6 miles) in diameter and has a rotation period of 35.4 hours and likely an elongated shape.\n\nDescription\n1996 PW orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.5–504 AU once every 4,033 years (semi-major axis of 253 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.99 and an inclination of 30° with respect to the ecliptic.Simulations indicate that it has most likely come from the Oort cloud, with a roughly equal probability of being an extinct comet and a rocky body that was originally scattered into the Oort cloud. The discovery of 1996 PW prompted theoretical research that suggests that roughly 1 to 2 percent of the Oort cloud objects are rocky.1996 PW was first observed on 9 August 1996 by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) automated search camera on Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. It is the first object that is not an active comet discovered on an orbit typical of long-period comets.1996 PW has a rotation period of 35.44±0.02 hours and a double-peaked lightcurve with a high amplitude of 0.44±0.03 magnitude (U=3). Its spectrum is moderately red and featureless, typical of D-type asteroids and bare comet nuclei. Its spectrum suggests an extinct comet.

The film stars Mandakini and Rajiv Kapoor in lead roles. Music director Ravindra Jain received a Filmfare Award for this film.\nThe film generated controversy because of Mandakini's bold scenes of breastfeeding and bathing in a transparent saree, which wasn't something the conservative Indian Film Certification Board allowed then. Yet, it had a U (Universal) age rating, which was later amended to U/A. It was the last film directed by Raj Kapoor.\nRam Teri Ganga Maili is included in the 'All-Time Blockbusters' list of Indian Cinema. It was certified Diamond Jubilee in Mumbai and Golden Jubilee in other major cities. The film was the year's highest-grossing film. It was also one of the highest-grossing films of the 1980s, alongside Kranti (1981) and Maine Pyar Kiya (1989).\n\nPlot\nNarendra Sahay a.k.a. \"Naren\" is the son of Jeeva Sahay. He is a rich politician in Calcutta. Naren visits Gangotri to study the source of the holy river Ganga, and to get some holy water for his wheelchair-using paternal grandmother. There he meets a very pretty girl named Ganga Singh. Ganga lives near Gangotri with her brother, Karam. Soon, they fall in love and decide to marry. They are happily married but suddenly Naren has to return to Calcutta as he wanted to convince his parents about Ganga. While leaving for Calcutta, he promised that he will soon return to her. But he is prevented from doing so.\nGanga became pregnant at the time of his leaving and soon, she becomes mother of a child. She faces many problems at her place because of her child and her beauty. Ganga was alone and no one was there to look after her; finally she decides to go to her husband, Naren. Ganga travels from her place, Gangotri to Calcutta to find her husband. At Rishikesh, she was exploited by two women and a man. Then at Benaras, she was molested by a Pandit, rescued by the police and given a ticket to Calcutta. She fell into the clutches of Manilal who lured her to a brothel near Benaras. At the end she meets her husband when he was marrying another girl. His father fixes his marriage with Radha Choudhary, who is the daughter of his friend, Bhagwat Choudhary. Naren was being informed that Ganga is dead. So, he decided to marry according to his father's wish. On the other hand, Ganga is invited to dance on her husband's marriage. But lastly, love wins and Naren recognizes his wife Ganga. They try to go away from there with their son but Bhagwat Choudhary shoots Ganga in a fit of rage. Ganga gets shot by him on her hand and Naren starts beating Bhagwat Choudhary, believing that he killed Ganga. But then Radha informs him that Ganga isn't dead yet. Naren stops beating Bhagwat and leaves with Ganga and their son.\n\nCast\nRajiv Kapoor as Narendra \"Naren\" Sahay\nMandakini as Ganga Sahay\nDivya Rana as Radha B.

Mandakini, who ultimately played the role, disputed Kolhapure's claims. She said Raj Kapoor wanted only a new face, rather than an established actress, as he believed he could not \"make someone pure Ganga if they have an established image\". Mandakini also stated that she did not breastfeed despite popular belief, but the scene was shot in a way to suggest that.\n\nCultural allusions\nAccording to Philip Lutgendorf, the movie is an allegory that \"synthesizes classical and mythic narrative, soft-core political and social commentary (here condemning the corruption of politicians and capitalists and championing the nascent environmental initiatives of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi). The narrative recapitulates the Abhijñānaśākuntalam story that first appeared in the epic Mahabharata and then was reworked, some six hundred years later, by the poet Kalidasa.\"\nThe final song sequence \"Ek Radha ek Meera\" brings Raj Kapoor's personal experiences with filmdom and reality. This song sequence is the climax of the plot where the bride-to-be is face-to-face with the other \"saut\", the culturally \"polluted\" dancer who has made that journey from the pure source of the Himalayas to the ever-flowing and ever-absorbing Ganges with all of the human impurities. It also differentiates between the love of Radha and Meera and reconnects the movie back to the Krishna Leelas.\nThe movie was a hit, and it earned Mandakini a Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. The film also caused a stir because of two scenes: one in which Mandakini bathes under a waterfall wearing only a flimsy white saree through which her breasts are clearly visible and another in which she is shown breast-feeding a child. Some critics claimed that the scenes were vulgar and exploitative, and were used to get around the Censor Board's stringent rules against nudity. Kapoor defended the inclusion of the scenes stating that they were tasteful.\n\nAwards\n33rd Filmfare Awards:Won\n\nBest Film – Randhir Kapoor\nBest Director – Raj Kapoor\nBest Music Director – Ravindra Jain\nBest Art Direction – Suresh J.

Indian author Mahasweta Devi stopped the show with her inaugural speech at the 2006 Frankfurt Book Fair when she used these lyrics to express her own heartfelt patriotism and debt to her country.\nIn 2014, Google commemorated his 90th birthday.Raj Kapoor was a canny judge of filmi music and lyrics. Many of the songs he commissioned are evergreen hits. He introduced the music directors Shankar–Jaikishan and the lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. He is also remembered for his strong sense of visual style. He used striking visual compositions, elaborate sets, and dramatic lighting to complete the mood set by the music. He introduced the actresses Nimmi, Dimple Kapadia, and Mandakini, as well as launching and reviving the careers of his sons Rishi, Randhir and Rajiv. Famous for making his actresses reveal the body, not very common then in Indian cinema, it was said his 'show-womanship' matched his showmanship.Raj Kapoor's Shree 420 (1955) movie's Hindi song Mera Joota Hai Japani (\"My Shoes are Japanese\") was used in opening sequence of 20th Century Studios 2016 movie Deadpool, starring Ryan Reynolds.The 1967 \"Song about Yogis\" (Russian: Песенка про йогов) by Vladimir Vysotsky mentions Raj Kapoor as one of the three best-known symbols of Indian culture in the Soviet Union, along with Shiva and yoga.He was called \"the Clark Gable of the Indian film industry\".\n\nAwards and honors\nKapoor had received many awards throughout his career, including 3 National Film Awards, 11 Filmfare Awards and 21 nominations. His films Awaara (1951) and Boot Polish (1954) were nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His acting in the former was rated as one of the \"Top Ten Performances of All Time in World Cinema\" by Time magazine. His film Jagte Raho (1956) also won the Crystal Globe award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\nThe Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1987 – the highest award for cinematic excellence in India. In 2001, he was honoured with \"Best Director of the Millennium\" by Stardust Awards. He was named \"Showman of the Millennium\" by Star Screen Awards in 2002.\nIn June 2011, Noah Cowan, artistic director of TIFF Bell Lightbox, and Sabbas Joseph, Director, Wizcraft along with members of the Kapoor family came together to pay tribute to the life and work of Indian actor, director, mogul and legend Raj Kapoor, as presented in partnership by TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA), and the Government of Ontario.

He worked with them in 20 films in all including 10 of his own films from Barsaat until Kal Aaj Aur Kal.  (Jagte Raho with Salil Chowdhury and Ab Dilli Dur Nahin being two exceptions in this period). Only after Jaikishan died, did he turn to a different music director – Laxmikant–Pyarelal for Bobby, Satyam Shivam Sundaram and Prem Rog (later on, his children used Laxmikant-Pyarelal for Prem Granth as well), Rahul Dev Burman for Dharam Karam, and Ravindra Jain for (Ram Teri Ganga Maili and Henna). Raj Kapoor acted in a movie with music by Madan Mohan only once (twice), i.e. Dhoon (1953) & Ashiana (1952), which featured duet Hum Pyaar Karenge by Hemant Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar, the only instance of Hemant Kumar giving playback to Raj Kapoor, and did only one movie with O.

Sarpsborg 08 and its predecessors played in 1. divisjon from 2005 to 2010. In 2010, the club was promoted to the Tippeligaen, the top league in Norway, but finished last and was relegated back to 1. divisjon in 2011. In 2012, they were promoted again and 6 years after, they qualified for their first Europa League group stage. They play their home games at Sarpsborg Stadion.\n\nHistory\nPre-existence\nFootball in Sarpsborg has traditionally been dominated by Sarpsborg FK (SFK), which won the Norwegian Cup six times and played 20 seasons in the top division, and to a lesser extent IL Sparta, which won the Norwegian Cup in 1952 and played nine seasons in the top division. However, after SFK's relegation from the 1974, no teams from Sarpsborg played in the top division for the next two decades. In 1999, 16 teams in the Sarpsborg area joined forces to create a team that could compete in the top divisions of Norwegian football, called Sarpsborg Fotball, which overtook SFK's spot in the league-system. In its first season, the team was relegated from the 2. divisjon, and several clubs, including both SFK and Sparta, withdrew from the collaboration.\nThe remaining clubs in the \"Sarpsborg Fotball\" project formed a new club called Borg Fotball, which won promotion to the 2. divisjon in 2002, but was relegated again in 2003. Meanwhile, Sparta was promoted to the Second Division the same season, and re-entered the collaboration club which now was renamed FK Sparta Sarpsborg. The club earned promotion to 1. divisjon (the second tier of Norwegian football) in 2005.\n\nFoundation\nAt the end of the 2007 season, the last major club in the district, Sarpsborg FK, joined the collaboration of teams and ended a rather long and hefty rivalry between the two clubs. At the same time, in an effort to unite the different factions within the collaboration, the jersey was changed and the club renamed itself Sarpsborg Sparta FK. This name remained a source of contention throughout the 2008 season, however, and a new name, Sarpsborg 08 FF, was adopted in 2009.\nThe 2009 season started badly for Sarpsborg, and it appeared they would be fighting against relegation to the 2. divisjon. The situation worsened when the Football Association of Norway determined that Sarpsborg 08 had submitted an unrealistic budget when they obtained their license to play in the 1. divisjon, and were penalized three points in June, leaving Sarpsborg in a relegation spot. However, after Roar Johansen became coach, the second part of the season went well for the team, which not only climbed out of the relegation spots, but finished fifth, allowing them to participate in the qualification matches for the 2010 Tippeligaen. In the semi-final match of the qualification, Sarpsborg defeated local rivals Fredrikstad FK 2–0 (who were therefore relegated from the top division). In the home match of the qualification final, Sarpsborg defeated Kongsvinger 3–2, but lost the second leg 3–1 and remained in the 1. divisjon.\n\nPromotions and development\nThe 2010 season ended with a 4–0 home-win against Alta. This meant that the team ended in second place, after league-winner Sogndal, and won the right to play in the 2011 edition of the Tippeligaen.\nThe 2011 season started with a surprising 3–0 win against Molde in Ole Gunnar Solskjær first match as manager of Molde. But after a good start, Sarpsborg was relegated back to 1. divisjon on 23 October 2011, when they lost 3–0 away at Brann with three rounds left to play. The club finished last with only 21 points.\nIn the 2012 season, Sarpsborg finished the 1. divisjon in second place and was promoted to Tippeligaen. On 3 January 2013, former Sheffield United striker Brian Deane was appointed as head coach. In 2015, Geir Bakke took over as head coach and led the club to their first Norwegian Cup final. They lost the 2015 Norwegian Football Cup final 0−2 against Rosenborg. In 2017 they repeated the feat and reached the final again, but lost 2–3 against Lillestrøm. Sarpsborg finished in third place in the 2017 Eliteserien, their first medal-winning position in club history.\nOn 30 August 2018 Sarpsborg 08 qualified for the group stage of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League for the first time in history.\n\nAfrican springboard\nSarpsborg 08 has gained a reputation as one of the best springboards for African players in need of a European acclimatization club. Senegalese Makthar Thioune played three years for Sparta Sarpsborg and Sarpsborg Sparta (Sarpsborg 08's predecessors) in the second tier, and when Molde purchased him in 2009 he was immediately \"Player of the Year\" in the top league, with the third highest rating in a 25-year period. He later played in Germany. Another big Sarpsborg 08 transfer in 2014 happened when Guangshou R&F manager Sven Göran Eriksson purchased Aaron Samuel from Sarpsborg 08 for €1.4m. Samuel blossomed in Sarpsborg with 13 goals in a year, after only 2 goals in big city club Vålerenga. He also scored both his goals for Nigeria in 2014. In 2017 Sarpsborg 08 signed Krepin Diatta from Senegal. He hardly played in his first half year in the club, but then blossomed with 5 goals and 8 assists in 3 months. Diatta was then sold to Brügge for €2.65m and later to Monaco for €16.7m. In 2019 Sarpsborg 08 signed Malian Ismaila Coulibaly and while acclimatized he only started 5 matches in the first 35 league matches while in the club. Then he was given the chance at a time the club was rock bottom with five losses in five matches. The club then took 17 points in the next 6 weeks and Coulibaly dominated with 4 goals, leading to Sheffield United purchasing him for €2m. Being only the 16th largest municipality in Norway, the processing of African teenage talents has been a major success factor leading to Sarpsborg 08 fighting above the size of the city.\n\nRecent history\nEuropean39 consecutive games without a win in Tippeligaen. This is the longest run without winning a single game across any top division in Europe.\n\nBadge\nSince the club was founded in 1905, the club badge had been a blue and white pennant. In November 2017, the badge was replaced with a more modernised version in all black. The new crest was in use for four years, before Start decided to return to the old one in March 2022.\n\nAchievements\nEliteserien:\nWinners (2): 1978, 1980\nRunners-up (1): 2005\nThird place (7): 1973, 1975, 1979, 1983, 1984, 1991, 1992\nNorwegian Cup:\nSemi finalist (7): 1975, 1978, 1988, 2000, 2006, 2011, 2018\n1. divisjon:\nWinners (4): 1968, 1972, 2004, 2012\nPromotion: 1958–59, 1988, 1999, 2001, 2008, 2017\n\nRecent history\nSource:\n\nCurrent squad\nAs of 12 April 2023Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

While at Oxford, he became friends with Chelsea Clinton. After graduating from Oxford, Woods worked briefly at The Guardian before becoming an actor.While at Oxford in 2000, he was in a relationship with Rosamund Pike that lasted two years. The two later played lovers Jane Bennet and Charles Bingley in Pride & Prejudice.\nSince 2009, Woods has been in a relationship with Christopher Bailey, the former chief executive of the British fashion house, Burberry. They married in 2012. They have two daughters, Iris and Nell.\n\nFilmography\nPlaywright\nWoods's stage play Hansard was presented at the Lyttelton Theatre, London, in September 2019. The work, named after the official record of proceedings in the British parliament, was directed by Simon Godwin.\nPassage 2:\nClaire Fraser (character)\nClaire Beauchamp (who adopts the surnames Randall, Fraser, and Grey at various times) is a fictional character in the Outlander series of multi-genre novels by American author Diana Gabaldon, and its television adaptation. In the series, Claire is a married World War II nurse visiting Scotland who finds herself transported from 1945 back to 1743. There she finds adventure, war and romance with the dashing Highland warrior Jamie Fraser. Smart, stubborn and willful, Claire uses her wits, practical medical skills and knowledge of the future to survive in the 18th century.\nClaire is portrayed by Irish actress Caitríona Balfe in the Starz television series Outlander. Balfe won a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2015 and 2016, and a People's Choice Award for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actress in 2016. She also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nCharacter\nWhen visiting Scotland, married World War II nurse Claire Randall is transported through time from 1945 back to 1743. There she finds adventure, war and romance with the dashing Highland warrior Jamie Fraser. In the following novels, after the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden, Claire travels back to her time where she spends 20 years with her former husband Frank Randall, becoming a medical doctor and a surgeon, and raising her and Jamie's daughter Brianna. Finally, having discovered that Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden, she returns to 18th century Scotland and reunites with Jamie. The couple settles in North Carolina, and is soon joined by their daughter Brianna as well as many Scottish settlers.\nGabaldon originally intended Outlander to be straight historical fiction, but after a few days of writing Claire she realized that the character did not behave like an 18th century woman. Gabaldon eventually leaned into the modern approach to Claire, which prompted the introduction of time travel. Claire is often described as stubborn and impatient, and she refuses to conform to the 18th century societal expectations of women. Practicing medicine and putting to use her 20th century medical knowledge leads to numerous accusations of witchcraft, including a witch trial.\n\nOutlander novels\nOutlander (1991)\nDragonfly in Amber (1992)\nVoyager (1994)\nDrums of Autumn (1997)\nThe Fiery Cross (2001)\nA Breath of Snow and Ashes (2005)\nAn Echo in the Bone (2009)\nWritten in My Own Heart's Blood (2014)\nGo Tell the Bees That I Am Gone (2021)\n\nTelevision series\nClaire is portrayed by Irish actress Caitríona Balfe in the Starz television series Outlander.\n\nAwards and nominations\nBalfe won a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2015 and 2016, and a People's Choice Award for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actress in 2016. She also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nPassage 3:\nThe Flashman Papers\nThe Flashman Papers is a series of novels and short stories written by George MacDonald Fraser, the first of which was published in 1969. The books centre on the exploits of the fictional protagonist Harry Flashman. He is a cowardly British soldier, rake and cad who is placed in a series of real historical incidents between 1839 and 1894. While the incidents and much of the detail in the novels have a factual background, Flashman's actions in the stories are either fictional, or Fraser uses the actions of unidentified individuals and assigns them to Flashman. Flashman is a character in the 1857 novel by Thomas Hughes, Tom Brown's School Days; Hughes' version of the character is a bully at Rugby School who is expelled for drunkenness. The character was then developed by Fraser, and appeared in the 1969 novel Flashman. Fraser went on to write a total of eleven novels and one collection of short stories featuring the character.\nDuring the course of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his expulsion from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries to run away from any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so relatively capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: by the end of the ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.\nThe publication sequence of the books differs from the fictional chronology, with the time frame of some books overlapping. One of the novels, Flashman and the Redskins, is in two parts: part one takes place in 1849–50, while the second covers 1said \"There has not been such a proud display of tartanalia since the opening of the 2014 Commonwealth Games\". Alastair McKay of The Evening Standard quoted Saraiya's comparison with Downton Abbey, adding \"[The comparison] is entirely correct. It is magical-mystical heuchter-teuchter cobblers.\" Euan Ferguson of The Observer called it \"gorgeous drivel\" and Thomas Batten of The Guardian stated \"If you love the scenery, shifting allegiances and palace intrigue of [Game of Thrones], but find yourself wishing the pace were a little slower and that the sex scenes were filmed in a more pretentious manner with lots of slow pans and softer lighting, here's your show.\" Graeme Virtue noted \"the rather languid pace of the opening episodes\", but praised the show's \"rare acknowledgment of the female gaze\" in its treatment of sex scenes. The Daily Telegraph also made the Game of Thrones comparison, while The Independent stated \"...yes, it's a time-travelling, wish-fulfilment fantasy, but it's done with such flair and attention to detail that it's impossible not to hop on board for the ride.\"\n\nSeason 2\nThe second season received universal acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a score of 85 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".

The website consensus reads: \"Outlander's romantic ardor doesn't burn as bright in this fifth season, but the Frasers remain an enthralling pair as they try to forge a home together.\"\n\nSeason 6\nThe sixth season has an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.8/10 based on 9 reviews.\n\nSeason 7\nThe seventh season has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 6 reviews. On Metacritic, it has received a score of 75 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRatings\nThe first eight episodes averaged more than 5.1 million multiplatform viewers. In July 2015, noting Outlander's strong ratings, its \"vocal online fandom and a slew of think pieces tied to its feminist twists on the action genre\", Josef Adalian of Vulture credited Outlander as one of the series responsible for Starz's increased success against competitors like Showtime. On February 11, 2020, cable provider Comcast moved Starz from its base cable packages to an a la carte option. This occurred five days before the premiere of season five.\n\nAccolades\nPrequel series\nIn February 2022, it was reported that a prequel series was in works, with Matthew B. Roberts writing and executive producing. In May 2022, executive producer Maril Davis confirmed that the series would focus on the parents of Jamie Fraser.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nDouglas Murray (author)\nDouglas Kear Murray (born 16 July 1979) is a British author and political commentator. He founded the Centre for Social Cohesion in 2007, which became part of the Henry Jackson Society, where he was associate director from 2011 to 2018. He is also an associate editor of the conservative-leaning British political and cultural magazine The Spectator. Murray has also written columns for publications such as The Wall Street Journal.\nMurray's books include Neoconservatism: Why We Need It (2005), Bloody Sunday: Truths, Lies and the Saville Inquiry (2011) about the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam (2017), The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity (2019), and The War on the West: How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason (2022).\nAyaan Hirsi Ali and Sohrab Ahmari have praised Murray's work and writing on Islam in Europe. French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy has said of Murray, \"Whether one agrees with him or not\" he is \"one of the most important public intellectuals today.\" Critics claim his views and ideology are linked to far-right political ideologies and accuse him of promoting far-right conspiracy theories such as Eurabia, the Great Replacement, and cultural Marxism. Murray has rejected descriptions of his politics as far-right.\n\nEarly life\nMurray was born in Hammersmith, London, to an English, school teacher mother, and a Scottish, Gaelic-speaking father who had been born on the Isle of Lewis and who worked as a civil servant. He has one elder brother. In an interview with The Herald Murray stated that his father had intended to be in London temporarily but stayed after meeting his mother and that they \"encouraged a good discussion around the dinner table\" when he was growing up but \"neither are political.\"Murray was educated at his local state primary and secondary schools, before going to a comprehensive which had previously been a grammar school. Recalling this experience in 2011, he wrote, \"My parents had been promised that the old grammar school standards and ethos remained, but none did. By the time I arrived the school was what would now be described as 'an inner-city sink school', a war zone similar to those many of the children's parents had escaped from.\" Murray's parents withdrew him from the school after a year. He was awarded scholarships to St Benedict's School, Ealing, and subsequently Eton College, before going on to study English at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nPublications\nAt age 19, while in his second year at the University of Oxford, Murray published Bosie: A Biography of Lord Alfred Douglas, which was described by Christopher Hitchens as \"masterly\". Bosie was awarded a Lambda Award for a gay biography in 2000. After leaving Oxford, Murray wrote a play, Nightfall, about the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.In 2006, Murray published a defence of neoconservatism – Neoconservatism: Why We Need It – and went on a speaking tour promoting the book in the United States. The publication was subsequently reviewed in the newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat by the Iranian author Amir Taheri: \"Whether one agrees with him or not Murray has made a valuable contribution to the global battle of ideas.\" In 2007, he assisted in the writing of Towards a Grand Strategy for an Uncertain World: Renewing Transatlantic Partnership by Gen. Dr. Klaus Naumann, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Field Marshal The Lord Inge, Adm. Jacques Lanxade, and Gen. Henk van den Breemen. His book Bloody Sunday was (jointly) awarded the 2011–2012 Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. In June 2013, Murray's e-book Islamophilia: a Very Metropolitan Malady was published.In 2017, Murray published The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, which spent almost 20 weeks on The Sunday Times bestseller list and was a No. 1 bestseller in non-fiction. It has since been published in over 20 languages. In The Strange Death of Europe, Murray argued that Europe \"is committing suicide\" by allowing non-European immigration into its borders and losing its \"faith in its beliefs\". The book received a polarized response from critics. Juliet Samuel of The Telegraph praised Murray, saying that: \"His overall thesis, that a guilt-driven and exhausted Europe is playing fast and loose with its precious modern values by embracing migration on such a scale, is hard to refute.\" An academic review in the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs acclaimed the book as \"explosive\" and \"an elegantly written, copiously documented exposé of Europe's suicidal hypocrisy\". Rod Liddle of The Sunday Times called the book \"a brilliant, important and profoundly depressing book\".Other reviews of the book were highly negative. In The Guardian, the political journalist Gaby Hinsliff described Strange Death as \"gentrified xenophobia\" and \"Chapter after chapter circles around the same repetitive themes: migrants raping and murdering and terrorising\", also pointing out that Murray offers little definition of the European culture which he claims is under threat. Writing in The New York Times, Pankaj Mishra described the book as \"a handy digest of far-right clichés\". Mishra accused Murray of defending Pegida, of writing that the English Defence League \"had a point\", and of describing Viktor Orbán as a better sentinel of \"European values\" than George Soros. Writing in The Intercept, Murtaza Hussain criticised what he called the \"relentlessly paranoid tenor\" and \"apocalyptic picture of Europe\" portrayed in the book, while challenging the links Murray made between non-European immigration and large increases in crime. In Middle East Eye, Georgetown professor Ian Almond called the book \"a staggeringly one-sided flow of statistics, interviews and examples, reflecting a clear decision to make the book a rhetorical claim that Europe is doomed to self-destruction\".Murray wrote about social justice and identity politics in his 2019 book The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity which became a Sunday Times bestseller. It was also nominated as an audio book of the year for the British Book Awards. In the book, Murray points to what he sees as a cultural shift, away from established modes of religion and political ideology, in which various forms of victimhood can provide markers of social status. He divides his book into sections dealing with different forms of victimhood, including types of LGBT identity, feminism and racial politics. Murray criticises the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault for what he sees as a reduction of society to a system of power relations. Murray's book drew polarized responses from critics. Tim Stanley in The Daily Telegraph praised the book, calling Murray \"a superbly perceptive guide through the age of the social justice warrior\". Katie Law in the Evening Standard said that Murray \"tackled another necessary and provocativewas married to Max Stafford-Clark, the director of the theatre during some of that period.

He is described as hailing from Baghdad during the early Abbasid Caliphate (8th and 9th centuries A.D.). In the course of seven voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures in magical realms, encountering monsters and witnessing supernatural phenomena.\n\nOrigins and sources\nThe tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the One Thousand and One Nights – they do not feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and they appear as an independent cycle in 18th- and 19th-century collections. The tale reflects the trend within the Abbasid realm of Arab and Muslim sailors exploring the world. The stories display the folk and themes present in works of that time. The Abbasid reign was known as a period of great economic and social growth. Arab and Muslim traders would seek new trading routes and people to trade with. This process of growth is reflected in the Sinbad tales. The Sinbad stories take on a variety of different themes. Later sources include Abbasid works such as the \"Wonders of the Created World\", reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean.The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809). The Sinbad tales are included in the first European translation of the Nights, Antoine Galland's Les mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français, an English edition of which appeared in 1711 as The new Arabian winter nights entertainments and went through numerous editions throughout the 18th century.\nThe earliest separate publication of the Sinbad tales in English found in the British Library is an adaptation as The Adventures of Houran Banow, etc. (Taken from the Arabian Nights, being the third and fourth voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.), around 1770. An early US edition, The seven voyages of Sinbad the sailor. And The story of Aladdin; or, The wonderful lamp, was published in Philadelphia in 1794. Numerous popular editions followed in the early 19th century, including a chapbook edition by Thomas Tegg. Its best known full translation was perhaps as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton's 1885 translation of The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night.\n\nTales\nSinbad the Porter and Sinbad the Sailor\nLike the 1001 Nights, the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant's house, where he complains to God about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy \"by Fortune and Fate\" in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate.\n\nFirst Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor\nAfter dissipating the wealth left to him by his father, Sinbad goes to sea to repair his fortune. He sets ashore on what appears to be an island, but this island proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale on which trees have taken root ever since the whale was young. Awakened by a fire kindled by the sailors, the whale dives into the depths, the ship departs without Sinbad, and Sinbad is only saved by a passing wooden trough sent by the grace of Allah. He is washed ashore on a densely wooded island. While exploring the deserted island, he comes across one of the king's grooms. When Sinbad helps save the king's mare from being drowned by a sea horse (not a seahorse, but a supernatural horse that lives underwater), the groom brings Sinbad to the king. The king befriends Sinbad, and he rises in the king's favor and becomes a trusted courtier. One day, the very ship on which Sinbad set sail docks at the island, and he reclaims his goods (still in the ship's hold). Sinbad gives the king his goods and in return the king gives him rich presents. Sinbad sells these presents for a great profit. Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where he resumes a life of ease and pleasure. With the ending of the tale, Sinbad the sailor makes Sinbad the porter a gift of a hundred gold pieces and bids him return the next day to hear more about his adventures.\n\nSecond Voyage\nOn the second day of Sinbad's tale-telling (but the 549th night of Scheherazade's), Sinbad the sailor tells how he grew restless of his life of leisure, and set to sea again, \"possessed with the thought of traveling about the world of men and seeing their cities and islands.\" Accidentally abandoned by his shipmates again, he finds himself stranded in an island which contains roc eggs. He attaches himself with the help of his turban to a roc and is transported to a valley of giant snakes which can swallow elephants; these serve as the rocs' natural prey. The floor of the valley is carpeted with diamonds, and merchants harvest these by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley: the birds carry the meat back to their nests, and the men drive the birds away and collect the diamonds stuck to the meat. The wily Sinbad straps one of the pieces of meat to his back and is carried back to the nest along with a large sack full of precious gems. Rescued from the nest by the merchants, he returns to Baghdad with a fortune in diamonds, seeing many marvels along the way.\n\nThird Voyage\nSinbad sets sail again from Basra. But by ill chance, he and his companions are cast up on an island where they are captured by a \"huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of colour, ... with eyes like coals of fire and large canine teeth like boar's tusks and a vast big gape like the mouth of a well. Moreover, he had long loose lips like camel's, hanging down upon his breast, and ears like two Jarms falling over his shoulder-blades, and the nails of his hands were like the claws of a lion.\" This monster begins eating the crew, beginning with the Reis (captain), who is the fattest. (Burton notes that the giant \"is distinctly Polyphemus\".)\nSinbad hatches a plan to blind the beast with the two red-hot iron spits with which the monster has been kebabbing and roasting the ship's company. He and the remaining men escape on awas recognized in 882 by the award of the honorific title Dhu'l-wizaratayn (\"possessor of the two vizierates\"), with which he appears even on coins. However, the activities of his brother, Abdun, who had remained a Christian and tried to obtain concessions for the Christian subjects of the Caliphate, brought about his sudden fall from power in 885. He died in 889.\nSa'id has been erroneously considered by some writers as the brother of another Christian convert, al-Hasan ibn Makhlad al-Jarrah, who was his predecessor as vizier.\n\nSources\nSourdel, Dominique (1971). \"Ibn Makhlad\".

OCLC 495469525.\nPassage 7:\nNahrawan Canal\nThe Nahrevan Canal (Persian: کانال نرهوان) was a major irrigation system of the Sassanid and early Islamic periods in central Iraq, along the eastern banks of the Tigris and the lower course of the Diyala River. Created in the 6th century, it reached its peak under the Abbasid Caliphate, when it served the main water supply for the Abbasid capital of Baghdad, while the regions irrigated by it served as the city's main breadbasket. Its destruction and progressive abandonment from the mid-10th century onwards mirror the Abbasid Caliphate's decline.\n\nHistory\nThe first irrigation works along the Diyala River were undertaken in Parthian times. Indeed, it may be that the lower part of the Nahrawan Canal was originally the lower course of the Diyala. The large-scale canal system of early medieval times however was created in the reign of the Sassanid ruler Khosrau I (r. 531–579), who also established it as a separate administrative district (Bazidjan Khusraw). A treasury and mint were possibly established there.In early Islamic times, the town of Jisr al-Nahrawan in the middle of the canal was the site of the Battle of Nahrawan on 17 July 658 between Ali and the Kharijites under Abdallah ibn Wahb. Under the early Caliphates, and especially under the Abbasids who made nearby Baghdad their capital, the canal network was repaired and expanded, reaching its peak in the 9th and early 10th centuries. In Abbasid times, the region was divided into three tax districts, Upper, Middle and Lower Nahrawan.The canal was breached in 937/8, during the revolt of Bajkam against Ibn Ra'iq; the latter tried to impede Bajkam's advance from Wasit to Baghdad by flooding the region in between. The move barely obstructed Bajkam, but succeeded in destroying the agriculture of the region, hitherto the breadbasket of the Abbasid capital. As Hugh N. Kennedy writes, \"the breach of the Nahrawan canal was simply the most dramatic example of a widespread phenomenon of the time; and it was symbolic of the end of ‘Abbasid power just as the breach of the Marib Dam was of the end of the prosperity of pre-Islamic south Arabia\". The lower and middle Nahrawan were entirely abandoned for almost 14 years, until the Buyids under Mu'izz al-Dawla restored the canal. Nevertheless, the canal network continued to decline thereafter. As late as 1140, the Seljuq governor Bihruz tried to restore it, but according to the 13th-century scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi, infighting among the Seljuqs once again meant the neglect of the canal, and its use as a road by their troops compounded the destruction of the network. By Yaqut's time, the canal network had largely silted up and the countryside along them was abandoned.\n\nOutline\nIn medieval times, the main canal was divided into three sections, described in detail by the 13th-century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, in his Mu'jam al-Buldan. The initial feeder canal drawing water from the Tigris at Dur al-Arabaya near Samarra and carrying it to the Diyala at Ba'quba was called al-katul al-Kisrawi ('the Cut of Khosrau'). During its course, it was joined by three smaller canals taken from the Tigris, the Yahudi ('of the Jews'), the al-Ma'muni, named after Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833), and the largest of the three, the Abu'l-Jund ('father of the army'), built under Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809).Some 20 km south of the inflow of the Abu'l-Jund stood the town of Salwa or Bab Salwa (Basalwa), and a little further on the town of Ba'quba, the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district, some 50 km north-northeast of Baghdad. From there, the main canal, now known as the Tamarra, turned south to the towns of Bajisra (originally Bayt al-Jisr, 'bridge-house') and finally Jisr al-Nahrawan, from where it was known as the Nahrawan proper. From Bajisra a canal, the Nahr al-Khalis, connected the main canal with the Tigris at Baradan and supplied the eastern suburbs of Baghdad with water, while another, the Nahr Bin, connected Jisr al-Nahrawan with Kalwadha south of Baghdad. Just south of Jisr al-Nahrawan there was another canal, the Diyala canal—the present course of the namesake river—which joined the Tigris some 5 km south of Baghdad. Jisr al-Nahrawan itself was a wealthy place, as there the Khurasan Road connecting Baghdad with Central Asia crossed the canal. Surviving descriptions record that it was extended on both sides of the canal, each with its own mosques, markets and hostels for travellers and pilgrims. It was abandoned by the 14th century, as the road to Khurasan was diverted north, through Ba'quba.Below Jisr al-Nahrawan came a large Sassanid-era weir (Shadhurwan), followed by the towns of Jisr Buran/Puran (named after Ma'mun's wife), Yarzatiya, 'Abarta, another weir, and the city of Iskaf Bani Junayd, divided by the canal in upper and lower towns. From Iskaf, the canal went on for another 100 km amidst a heavily cultivated landscape to rejoin the Tigris at Madharaya, near modern Kut.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nIn My Sleep\nIn My Sleep is a 2010 suspense thriller film written, directed and produced by film director Allen Wolf.  It stars Philip Winchester, Lacey Chabert, Tim Draxl, Abigail Spencer and Kelly Overton.  It also features Kirsten Vangsness from Criminal Minds in a cameo role and Tony Hale from Veep in a cameo as well.  The story is about a massage therapist with chronic insomnia who fears he may have murdered a good friend while sleepwalking.\n\nPlot\nMarcus (Philip Winchester) wakes up in a cemetery with no memory of how he got there. He suffers from parasomnia, a sleep disorder which causes him to do things while asleep which he cannot remember, and so is plagued with questions: \"Where was I last night? Who was I with?\"  Hoping to deal with his use of one-night stands to escape his problems, Marcus joins a Sexaholics Anonymous support group, where SA sponsor Derek (Michael Badalucco) helps him work through his problems.  His disorder takes a turn for the worse when he wakes up and finds himself covered in blood with a knife at his side and the police banging at his door. In a panic he hides the evidence and then learns from the police that Ann (Kelly Overton), wife of his best friend Justin (Tim Draxl), was found stabbed to death. Marcus is terrified to put together the pieces of how she might have been murdered. A series of mysterious phone calls make him believe that someone is watching him. Desperate to figure out what happens after he goes to sleep at night, he investigates his own nocturnal activities. His quest for the truth ends in a shocking revelation.\n\nCast\nPhilip Winchester as Marcus\nTim Draxl as Justin\nLacey Chabert as Becky\nKelly Overton as Ann\nAbigail Spencer as Gwen\nBeth Grant as Evelyn\nMichael Badalucco as Derek\nTony Hale as Ben\nKevin Kilner as Greg\nAmy Aquino as Detective Curwen\nAidan Mitchell as Young Marcus\nMarcelle Larice as Carissa\nAllan Wasserman as Dr. Schwarz\nAlexandra Paul as Roxana\nPatrick Labyorteaux as Rob\nBellamy Young as Olivia\nKirsten Vangsness as Madge\nShanna Collins as Jennifer\nKevin Michael Curran as David\nChristopher Darga as Officer Etling\nRobert Joseph as Officer\nLarry Clarke as Officer Knachez\nJoe Nunez as Mr. Mather\nVanessa Lee Evigan as Kelly\nBunny Levine as RachelForo De Cine\nMovieWeb\n\nProduction notes\nAllen Wolf wrote, directed and produced In My Sleep.  The film entered post production in August 2009, after having resolved several technical glitches before moving into sound design, music scoring and visual effects.  Sound design was handled by Hollywood's Jonathan Miller, whose works include Independence Day, Saw, Narc, Trainspotting, The Hills Have Eyes Part II, and many others, while music scoring was completed by Conrad Pope, who also orchestrated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Horton Hears a Who! and Julie & Julia and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and who recorded the score in Bulgaria and Los Angeles.  Ralph Winter was the executive producer.  Alyssa Weisberg, who won an Emmy for casting Lost and also cast Star Trek, was the casting director.\n\nRelease\nPremiere\nOn November 6, 2009, In My Sleep screened at the Fort Lauderdale Film Festival, where it won the Audience Choice Award.  The film has sold to over seventy countries around the world and has been translated into German, French and Spanish.\n\nBox office\nIn My Sleep has gotten a limited release, screening in more than fifteen cities and still in theatrical release in 2011, earning as  much as $9,285 in one screening, becoming the #1 new indie movie of opening weekend in Los Angeles. As of July 2011 the film's total gross has come to $90,093.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 13% based on reviews from 16 critics.  While critics conceded that the premise was interesting, they denounced the film as talky, dull, and technically shoddy. In a positive review, Duane Burges of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \"A well-stirred titillation that will appeal to twentysomething audiences and movie-buff viewers who appreciate the pursued-pursuer, Hitchcockian style of suspenser. \"In My Sleep\" works because the protagonist, while flawed, is completely likable and honorable. Philip Winchester exudes an integrity, as well as a gritty determination, which makes us root for him. John Anderson wrote in Variety that it \"boasts all the cerebral and aesthetic restraint of a West Hollywood dance club,\" and \"Production values are dire, with too much lighting and not enough design.\"  In the Los Angeles Times, Gary Goldstein wrote \"Writer-director Allen Wolf loads In My Sleep with so much psychosexual baggage you wish he just focused on one emotional affliction to propel this mediocre whodunit,\" and concludes \"It's ultimately all too contrived and superficial to feel convincing, despite the story's often lurid appeal.\"\n\nAwards\nThe film has won several festival awards:  \"Audience Award\" at Fort Lauderdale Film Festival, \"Best Feature Film\" at Omaha Film Festival, \"Best Narrative Film\" at the Las Vegas Film Festival, \"Audience Award\" at the Kansas City Film Festival, \"Gold Kahuna Award\" at Honolulu Festival and was a finalist for \"Best Feature\" at Kansas City Film Festival and the Orlando Film Festival.\nPassage 2:\nCameo appearance\nA cameo role, also called a cameo appearance and often shortened to just cameo (), is a brief appearance of a well-known person in a work of the performing arts. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake) or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo role as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequent cameos.\n\nConcept\nOriginally, in the 1920s, a \"cameo role\" meant \"a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts\". The Oxford English Dictionary connects this with the meaning \"a short literary sketch or portrait\", which is based on the literal meaning of \"cameo\", a miniature carving on a gemstone. More recently, in the late 20th century, a \"cameo\" has come to refer to any short appearance as a character, such as the examples below.Cameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity's stature and thefilms of the year by the American Film Institute. Metacritic analysis found the film was the ninth-most mentioned film on \"best of the year\" film rankings and the 22nd-most mentioned on \"best of the decade\" film rankings.\n\nControversies\nUse of animals\nThe Wolf of Wall Street uses animals, including a chimpanzee, a lion, a snake, a fish, and dogs. The chimpanzee and the lion were provided by the Big Cat Habitat wildlife sanctuary in Sarasota County, Florida. The four-year-old chimpanzee Chance spent time with DiCaprio and learned to roller skate in three weeks. The sanctuary also provided a lion named Handsome because the trading company depicted in the film used a lion as its symbol. Danny Porush denied that there were any animals in the office, although he admitted to eating an employee's goldfish.In December 2013, before the film premiered, the organization Friends of Animals criticized the use of the chimpanzee and organized a boycott of the film. Variety reported, \"Friends of Animals thinks the chimp ... suffered irreversible psychological damage after being forced to act.\" The Guardian commented on the increasing criticism of Hollywood's use of animals, writing, \"The Wolf of Wall Street's use of a chimpanzee arrives as Hollywood comes under ever-increasing scrutiny for its employment of animals on screen\". PETA also launched a campaign to highlight mistreatment of ape \"actors\" and to petition for DiCaprio not to work with great apes.\n\n1MDB scandal\nIn 2015, Red Granite Pictures and the film's financing became implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, a major international corruption scandal that began in Malaysia. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) alleged the film was financed by money producer Riza Aziz stole from the Malaysian 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) sovereign wealth fund. Aziz is the stepson of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Aziz was arrested in connection with the scandal and pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges in July 2019. According to court filings, a company owned by fugitive businessman Jho Low gave the film's producers a $9 million advance. Low was given a \"special thanks\" in the film's credits.The film is part of a broader investigation into these illicit monetary movements, and in 2016 was named in a series of civil complaints the United States Department of Justice filed \"for having provided a trust account through which hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to the 1MDB fund were illicitly siphoned\". To settle the civil lawsuit, Red Granite Pictures agreed to pay the U.S. government $60 million with no \"admission of wrongdoing or liability on the part of Red Granite\". This settlement was part of a more expansive U.S. effort to seize approximately $1.7 billion in assets allegedly purchased with funds embezzled from 1MDB. In January 2020, Belfort sued Red Granite for $300 million, also wishing to void his rights deal; he said that he would never have sold the rights to Red Granite if he had known how the film was being financed.\n\nThematic controversy and debate\nVarious people have criticized the film as materialistic, encouraging greedy behavior, extreme wealth, and advocating for the infamous individuals portrayed in the film. Christina McDowell, whose father, Tom Prousalis, worked in association with Belfort, accused the filmmakers of \"exacerbating our national obsession with wealth and status and glorifying greed and psychopathic behavior\". She emphasized the gravity and significance of Belfort's crimes, saying that Wolf of Wall Street is a \"reckless attempt at continuing to pretend that these sorts of schemes are entertaining, even as the country is reeling from yet another round of Wall Street scandals\".After DiCaprio defended himself from criticism, Variety journalist Whitney Friedlander called the film \"three hours of cash, drugs, hookers, repeat\" and argued that the film is a \"celebration of this lifestyle\" and implies that short-lived extreme wealth and extraordinary experiences are superior to normal behavior.Nikole TenBrink, vice president of marketing and membership at Risk and Insurance Management Society, has said the film is a \"cautionary tale of what can happen when fraud is left unchecked\". She describes Belfort's business acumen, his talent in communicating and selling his ideas, and his ability to motivate others as offering \"valuable lessons for risk professionals as they seek to avoid similar pitfalls\".\n\nBelfort's reaction\nBelfort said of the film's depiction of himself and Stratton Oakmont that it did an excellent job at describing the \"overall feeling\" of those years, adding, \"the camaraderie, the insanity, that was accurate\". Of his drug use, Belfort said that his actual habits were \"much worse\" than is depicted in the film and that he was \"on 22 different drugs at the end\".Belfort also analyzed the inaccuracies in the film's oversimplification of Stratton Oakmont's gradual transition from advocating for \"speculative stocks\" in order to \"help build America\" to committing crimes. He said he \"didn't like hearing\" overly simplified and blunt depictions of his crimes because \"it made me look like I was just trying to rip people off\". But Belfort did acknowledge the cinematic benefits of these oversimplifications as \"a very easy way in three hours\" to \"move the audience emotionally\".\n\nNadine Maculoso's reaction\nOn September 28, 2022, Nadine Maculoso, Belfort's ex-wife on whom the character Naomi was based, said that the depiction of Belfort and their relationship was accurate and that she hopes to educate people on signs of domestic abuse and toxic relationships.\n\nAccolades\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, Best Adapted Screenplay for Winter, Best Actor for DiCaprio, and Best Supporting Actor for Hill. It was also nominated for four BAFTAs, including Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, and two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. DiCaprio won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe film's soundtrack features both original and preexisting music tracks. It was released on December 17, 2013, for digital download. More than 60 songs are used in the film, but only 16 are on the official soundtrack. Among the notable exceptions are original compositions by Theodore Shapiro.\n\nSee also\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (1929 film)\nScam 1992\nThe Big Bull\nBoiler Room (film)\nGordon Gekko\nMicrocap stock fraud\nList of films that most frequently use the word \"fuck\"\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nMichael Tippett School\nHeron Academy (formerly The Michael Tippett School) is a special needs secondary school for students with severe learning difficulties located in south London. It was previously named after the composer Michael Tippett.  The building was designed by Marks Barfield Architect and completed in 2008. It can accommodate 80 students between the age of 11 and 19.It was built as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme and was the first school in London and the first special needs school in the country to be completed under the programme.Previously a community school administered by Lambeth London Borough Council, In February 2023 The Michael Tippett School converted to academy status and was renamed Heron Academy. The school is now sponsored by the London South East Academies Trust.\nPassage 2:\nFrançois-Benoît Hoffman\nFrançois-Benoît Hoffman (11 July 1760 – 25 April 1828) was a French playwright and critic, best known today for his operatic librettos, including those set to music by Étienne Méhul and Luigi Cherubini (most notably Cherubini's Médée, 1797).\n\nCareer\nHoffman was born in Nancy, and studied law at the University of Strasbourg.  Believing that his stammer hindered his legal career, he entered military service in Corsica. He served there for only a very short time, and, returning to Nancy, wrote some poems which brought him into notice at the little court of Lunéville over which the Marquise de Boufflers then presided. In 1784 he went to Paris where he wrote his first opera libretto, Phèdre, for the composer Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. It was performed at Fontainebleau in October 1786. After quarrelling with Lemoyne, Hoffman offered his libretto Adrien, empereur de Rome to Cherubini, who turned it down in favour of another Hoffman drama, Médée. Adrien was accepted instead by Méhul, with whom Hoffman collaborated on several operas, including Euphrosine (1790), Stratonice (1792) and Ariodant (1799).\nHoffman was a strong advocate of authors' rights regarding artistic control, copyright and freedom of speech. This stance often brought him into conflict with the authorities. A quarrel with the management of the Paris Opéra over Nephté led to them rejecting Médée in 1790. In 1792, the French Revolutionary government objected to Adrien on political grounds, and Hoffman ran considerable risk by refusing to make the changes proposed to him. It was seven years before Adrien finally received its premiere at the Opéra.\nHoffman's later operas were in a lighter style than his works of the 1790s. A notable example is Les rendez-vous bourgeois, with music by Isouard. In 1807 he was invited by Charles Guillaume Étienne to contribute to the Journal de l'Empire (afterwards the Journal des Débats). Hoffman's wide reading qualified him to write on all sorts of subjects, and he turned, apparently with no difficulty, from reviewing books on medicine to violent attacks on the Jesuits. His severe criticism of Chateaubriand's Les Martyrs led the author to make some changes in a later edition. He had the reputation of being an absolutely conscientious and incorruptible critic and thus exercised wide influence.Hoffman's poem Je te perds, fugitive espérance was set by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1806 in his song Als die Geliebte sich trennen wollten (WoO 132) in a translation by Stephan von Breuning.\n\nWorks\nThéâtrePhèdre, tragédie lyrique en 3 actes, music by Lemoyne, premiere 26 October 1786 au château de Fontainebleau ;\nNephté, tragédie lyrique en 3 actes, music by Lemoyne, premiere 15 December 1789 at the Opéra de Paris ;\nEuphrosine, ou le Tyran corrigé, comédie en 5 actes mise en musique by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere 4 October 1790 at the Comédie-Italienne (réduite à 4, puis à 3 actes) ;\nAdrien, opéra en 3 actes, music by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere January 1792, puis sous une forme révisée en 1802 ;\nStratonice, comédie héroïque en un acte et en vers, music by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere 3 May 1792 at the Comédie-Italienne ;\nLe jeune sage et le vieux fou, comédie en un acte mêlée de musique by Étienne Nicolas Méhul premiere 28 March 1793 at the Opéra-Comique ;\nAdélaïde, drame en 3 actes et en vers premiere 1793 ;\nCallias, drame en un acte et en vers premiere 1795 ;\nLe Brigand, opéra-comique en 3 actes premiere 1795 ;\nAzeline, comédie en 3 actes premiere 1797 ;\nMédée, opéra en 3 actes, music by Luigi Cherubini, premiere 1797 at the Théâtre Feydeau ;\nAriodant, drame en 3 actes mêlé de musique by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere 11 October 1799 at the Opéra-Comique ;\nBion, comédie en un acte mêlée de musique by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere 27 December 1800 at the Opéra-Comique ;\nLisistrata, ou Les Athéniennes, Comédie en un acte et en prose, mêlée de vaudevilles imitée d'Aristophane, premiere 15 January 1802 at the Théâtre Feydeau ;\nLe Trésor supposé ou le Danger d’écouter aux portes, comédie en un acte mêlée de musique by Étienne Nicolas Méhul, premiere 29 July 1802 à l'Opéra-Comique ;\nLe Roman d’une heure, comédie en un acte premiere Gymnase 1803 ;\nLa Ruse inutile, opéra-comique en 2 actes premiere 1805 ;\nGrimaldi, comédie en 3 actes, music by Rodolphe Kreutzer, premiere 1810.\nLa mort d'Abel, opera with music by Rodolphe Kreutzer, premiere 1810 (revised 1825)Romans, essaisMes souvenirs ou Recueil de pensées fugitives (1802) ;\n\nSources\nL.

V-L, with mixed results—according to Bowen \"the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello\".  The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in \"finding a sound\" that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.\n \nTippett described the longest and most ambitious of his late works, the oratorio The Mask of Time (1982), as \"a pageant of sorts with an ultimately lofty message\". Mellers called the work \"a mind-boggling cosmic history of the universe\".  Paul Driver, who had been a critic of Tippett's new style, wrote that the Mask revealed \"the authentic early Tippett\", with a return to the lyricism of The Midsummer Marriage and multiple acknowledgements of his early compositions.Tippett had intended The Ice Break to be his final opera, but in 1985 he began work on New Year. Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: \"... the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works.\" In Byzantium (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of W. B. Yeats's poem, with added orchestral interludes. By this time he was professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: \"I'm outside the music I've made, I have no interest in it\". After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with The Rose Lake (1993), described in Tippett's Daily Telegraph obituary as \"of luminous beauty ... a worthy ending to a remarkable career\".\n\nReputation and legacy\nIn a joint study of Tippett and Britten published in 1982, Whittall designated the pair as \"the two best British composers of that ... generation born between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War, and among the best of all composers born in the first two decades of the twentieth century\". After Britten's death in 1976, Tippett became widely regarded as the doyen of British music, but critical opinion of his later works was not always positive. After the first performance of the Triple Concerto in 1980, Driver wrote that \"not since The Knot Garden has [he] produced anything worthy of his early masterpieces\".In 1982, in his comparative study of Britten and Tippett, Whittall asserted that \"it would be difficult to claim that any of the works [Tippett] has begun in his seventies are the equal of earlier compositions\". Although both Driver and Whittall later modified their opinions, such comments represented a general view among critics that Tippett's creative powers had begun to decline after the triumph of King Priam. This perception was strongly expressed by Derek Puffett, who argued that the decline followed Tippett's abandonment of myth—seen as the key to the success of The Midsummer Marriage and King Priam—and stemmed from his increasingly futile efforts to universalise his private agonies and express them musically. Despite his admiration for the early works, Puffett consigned Tippett \"to the ranks of those noble but tragic composers who have lived beyond their time\". The  critic Norman Lebrecht, writing in 2005, dismissed almost all Tippett's output, labelling him \"a composer to forget\". With the forthcoming centenary celebrations in mind, Lebrecht wrote: \"I cannot begin to assess the damage to British music that will ensue from the coming year's purblind promotion of a composer who failed so insistently to observe the rules of his craft\".Against these criticisms Kemp maintained that while the style had become less immediately accessible, Tippett's later works showed no loss of creative power.  The critic Peter Wright, writing in 1999, challenged the \"decline\" theory with the view that the later compositions are \"harder to come to terms with ... because of the more challenging nature of their musical language\", a theme he developed in a detailed study of the Fifth String Quartet.After Tippett's death the more popular pieces from his first period continued to be played, but there was little public enthusiasm for the later works. After the relatively muted 2005 centenary celebrations, performances and recordings tailed off. In October 2012 Hewett wrote in the Daily Telegraph of a \"calamitous fall\" in Tippett's reputation since his death. Geraint Lewis acknowledges that \"no consensus yet exists in respect of the works composed from the 1960s onwards\", while forecasting that Tippett will in due course be recognised as one of the most original and powerful musical voices of twentieth-century Britain\".Many of Tippett's articles and broadcast talks were issued in collections between 1959 and 1995. In 1991 he published an episodic autobiography, Those Twentieth Century Blues, notable for its frank discussions of personal issues and relationships. Collectively, Tippett's writings define his aesthetic standpoint, which Clarke summarises thus: \"Tippett holds that art's role in post-Enlightenment culture is to offer a corrective to society's spiritually injurious domination by mass technology. Art, he suggests, can articulate areas of human experience, unapproachable through scientific rationality, by presenting 'images' of the inner world of the psyche.\"Although Tippett did not found a compositional school, composers who have acknowledged his influence include David Matthews and William Mathias. More generally, his musical and educational influence continues through the Michael Tippett Foundation. He is also commemorated in the Michael Tippett Centre, a concert venue within the Newton Park campus of Bath Spa University. In Lambeth, home of Morley College, is Heron Academy (previously named The Michael Tippett School), an educational facility for young people aged 11–19 with complex learning disabilities. Within the school's campus is the Tippett Music Centre, which offers music education for children of all ages and levels of ability.\n\nWritings\nThree collections of Tippett's articles and broadcast talks have been published:\n\nMoving into Aquarius (1959).

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nVarugad\nVarugad Fort  (Man T; 18� 00' N, 74� 00' E; RS Lonand 22 m. NW; p. 880), in Man  lies, as the crow flies, about twelve miles north-west of Dahivadi, within the limits of Panvan village. The best way to it is to camp at Pingli Budrukh four miles south-west of Dahivadi and to travel thence by the Tasganv-Mograla road for about ten miles to Jadhavvadi, a hamlet of Bijvadi village lying almost a quarter of a mile east and within sight of the road; from here a well marked track due west goes to the village of Tondle, and from Tondle a path leads direct to the fort over rough ground broken but perfectly passable by a pony, and skirting the northern base of the long plateau of Panvan. The direction of the path is generally a little north of west and it crosses innumerable small ravines and water-courses which lead through rough hill tracts to the edge of the plateau of which the Man  taluka chiefly consists. These streams pour down the bare sides of the main hill range, here some 1,000 to 1,500 feet high, on to the plain of Girvi adjoining the Phaltan taluka. The country all the way from Pingli is terribly bare and rocky. Here the stony hills and ravines are interrupted by fairly level plateaus with tolerable soil and good sites for cultivation and grazing. A few small deer and chinkharawill probably be seen, while cattle are everywhere browsing in considerable numbers. Three hamlets, one of them known as Ghodavadi, are reached, and some well-to-do cultivators will probably meet the visitor and turn out to be Gadkaris or descendants of the ancient hereditary fort garrison. The hamlet is situated on a projection between the two ravines, and has been built on a hill of a truncated conical shape.\nThe hill rises about 250 feet above the level of the plateau, which itself constitutes the summit of the Mahadev range at this point. The cone with the walls on it is seen from a great distance and appears very small indeed. But on near approach it is seen to be but the inner citadel of a place of considerable size and strength for the times in which it was built. On the south-west the outer wall or enceinte is entered by a rude gateway of a single pointed arch about eight feet high and five feet broad. As usual there is a curtain of solid masonry inside. The gate lies about 150 yards east of the edge of the plateau, which there terminates in an almost unbroken vertical precipice of several hundred feet in height and receding in a north-easterly direction. No wall was built along about three hundred yards of this part which is absolutely unscalable, but for the rest of the way the walling is continued along the edge of the cliff in a north-east direction for about another three hundred yards. Here it turns still following the cliff to the south-east for another seven hundred yards, and then gradually rounds to the westward covering four hundred and fifty yards more till it meets the gateway. But for the break of the inaccessible precipice this outer wall would form a nearly equilateral triangle with the corners rounded off, the side being of some six hundred and fifty yards. Facing nearly north, about fifty yards from the north-east angle, is a gateway with a couple of curtains in solid masonry. This entrance is cut in the sides of the cliff about twenty feet below the top which is reached by some dozen steps. It consisted as usual of a pointed arch, the top fallen in, about ten feet high by five broad. It leads out to the path down to Girvi, a village in the plains below and it probably formed the communication with Phaltan. This road winds down the face of the range for some five hundred feet till it hits the shoulder of a spur which it then follows to the base. The walling on the south side, from the edge of the cliff to some hundred yards east of the southern gate, is not more than a couple of feet in thickness and consists of all-fitting stones unmortared. The rest is massive and well mortared and still fairly preserved. The average height is from seven to ten feet. In the south-east angle is a rude temple of Bhairavnath and a few houses with the remains of Man y more. On the right side of the southern gate is a well preserved stone pond about thirty yards square with steps leading down to it. Next to and on the north of Bhairavnath's temple is another pond. The way up to the fort proper or upper and lower citadels is from the north side. The path up the hill side, which is steep but with grass and soil left in Man y places, is almost destroyed. About 150 feet up is the outer citadel built on a sort of shoulder of the hill and facing almost due west. It contains two massive bastions of excellent masonry looking north-west and south-west so that guns planted on them could comMan d respectively the north and south gateways. This citadel was connected with the main wall by a cross wall running across the whole breadth of the fort from east to west. Its entrance lies close below that to the upper citadel. A masonry curtain projects so as to hide the arch itself, which is not more than seven feet high by three broad, and has to be entered from due east. On the south side the walls are carried right up to the scarp of the upper citadel and are some ten feet high, so that to take the lower citadel in rear or flank must have been difficult. The upper citadel is above a vertical scarp some thirty feet high. The entrance to it lies some thirty feet above that to the lower citadel, and is cut in the rock about eight feet wide. There is a gateway of a pointed arch with the top fallen in and twenty odd steps leading up to it and ten more cut out of the rock, and winding up past the inside curtain on to the top. The walls of this upper citadel are still in tolerable preservation. They were originally about ten feet high and built of fair masonry. There is a large turret on the south-west corner, evidently meant to comMan d the southern gate. About ten yards to the east of this turret is a new looking building which was the headquarters or sadar. Immediately east of this and below it is a great pit about thirty feet square and equally deep roughly cut in the rock and said by the people to be a dungeon. Next to it on the south is a small pond evenly cut and lined with mortar used for storing water. There are some remains of sepoys' houses, and, near the turret, a small stone wheel said to belong to a gun. The outer walls east of the gates have bastions at every turn of the cliffs, and the masonry here is particularly strong and well preserved. It would appear that attacks were dreaded chiefly from the plain below. The assailants could either come up the spur towards the north entrance or they might attempt the spurs on the other side of the eastern ravine and attack the southern gateway. Hence apparently the reason for strengthening the walls of the enceinte on this side. After passing the southern gateway the assailants would be comMan ded from the lower citadel. They Would then be encountered by the cross wall. If that obstacle was overcome the besieged would run round the east side and into the two citadels. The appearanceimarama, St Heliers, Glendowie, St Johns, Meadowbank, and Ellerslie.\n\nRemuera Golf Club\nThe Remuera Golf Club started to develop in 1934 and the club house was finished in 1935. It was not an ideal location for a golf club, as it was established in a natural basin prone to seasonal flooding. In fact on several 19th century maps this was actually shown as a lake and referred to as 'Lake Remuera' or 'Lake St John' although in reality it was largely an area of swampy ground in which a sheet of shallow water would appear sporadically in the wet season. 133 acres (54 hectares) of land in the gully was given to the City Council in 1918 as Waiatarua Reserve. As the surrounding farm land was transformed into suburban housing this area became problematic – although the \"lake\" afforded a picturesque view for the new houses it was also a breeding ground for mosquitos. Moreover, the basin was composed of a peat-like substance subject to smouldering fires which were difficult to put out. In 1929 a drain was bored through the hill to the south west enabling the water to be drained into the adjacent natural stream which feeds into the nearby Oraki Basin; this drainage system is still in place.\nFifty acres of the park were leased to the Golf Club in 1934 and a course was laid out. In 1938 a new course was built around the original layout in response to members’ complaints about the course conditions. In 1968 the Course was redesigned by golf course specialist Harold Babbage and a new Club House has been built.\n\nConnections\nRemuera's reputation as a desirable residential area around the turn of the 20th century was reflected in the use of its name for a luxury liner. SS Remuera was a steamship launched in 1911. She was the last delivered of three 11000 tonners built by the William Denny Organization between 1909 and 1911 for the New Zealand Shipping Company (sister ships Ruahine and Rotorua). Her inaugural voyage in 1911 was from London to Wellington. In September 1914 she was the first British ship to pass through the newly complete Panama Canal.\nDuring the First War she was commandeered by the British Government. After the war she returned to the UK to New Zealand route, as a sign of the changing times she was now refitted to accommodate two classes of passengers as opposed to her initial layout of First, Second and Steerage. Again commandeered at the outbreak of war in 1939 she was torpedoed in the North Sea in September 1940.\n\nNotable residents\nJean Batten was a student at a Girls School at 4 Garden Road.\nArchibald Clark – MP (1805–1875) Auckland's first Mayor in 1851.\nJames Clark – Mayor of Auckland 1880–1883.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nI Hate Everything About You\n\"I Hate Everything About You\" is the debut single by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace, from their debut self-titled album. One of the band's signature songs, it peaked at number 55 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was the 9th best performing song of the decade on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and the 153rd best performing song of all time on the Alternative Songs chart. Despite not being one of their number one hits on either of the two charts, it is the band's longest running song on both the Modern Rock chart at 45 weeks, and the Mainstream Rock chart at 46 weeks.\n\nBackground\nAdam Gontier said of the track:\n\nThe song is pretty blunt you know? It's to the point. It's about realizing there's something in your life you're wasting time on. I think everybody, even in this band and a lot of other people have felt that way before at one point or another in their life. Whether it's a person, a relationship whatever it is, you're just wasting time on it. The song is a realization of that.\nWritten by Gontier and produced by Gavin Brown, the theme of the song deals with love–hate relationships.\n\nCritical reception\nHeather Phares of AllMusic called the song \"one of the better alt-metal/modern rock singles in recent memory.\" She remarked, \"At first, the song seems almost stupidly simple, both lyrically and musically. However, the controlled fury of the choruses and the ambivalent verses make the song a surprisingly smart and concise anthem for anyone stuck in a baffling relationship.\" She also stated, \"I Hate Everything About You's frustrated explosions and passive-aggressive recriminations eerily simulate the trajectory of an ill-fated couple.\"\n\nMusic video\nThe music video starts zoomed in towards several things, such as a TV producing static, a picture frame, and an ash tray, and then transitions towards Adam Gontier who starts singing. The video shows three teenagers going through a disastrous moment in their lives. One shows a young boy who finds his girlfriend cheating on him in the alleyway, kissing another guy. He is spying on them in his car. The second teenager is a young girl, who just broke up with her boyfriend, and the last is a boy who is being abused by his alcoholic father. Towards the end they are all seen smashing items into a hill. The young boy spying on his cheating girlfriend whips a portrait of a picture of them, smashing it to pieces. The second teenager is seen smashing her notebook of love notes and miscellaneous love items with her ex-boyfriend into the hill. The last boy, who is suffering child abuse, throws his drunken father's alcohol into the hill.\nIn the video, the word \"hit\" in \"after every hit we take\" is censored, due to \"hit\" being slang for drug use. The video was photographed by cinematographer Steve Gainer, and directed by Scott Winig.\n\nAccolades\nIn 2004, the song was nominated for the \"Best Rock Video\" and \"People's Choice: Favourite Canadian Group\" at the MuchMusic Video Awards and won \"Producer of the Year\" at the Juno Awards. In August 2007, the single won a BDS Spin Award based on the 300,000 spins it received.\n\nTrack listings\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nUse in video games\nNASCAR Thunder 2004 by EA Sports.\nKaraoke Revolution Volume 2 singalong game.\nIt is playable with either a real guitar or bass guitar in Rocksmith as DLC.\nThe song was made available to download on March 13, 2012, for play in Rock Band 3 Basic and PRO mode utilizing a real guitar / bass guitar, and MIDI compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards plus vocal harmonies.\nPassage 2:\nWorking Day and Night\n\"Working Day and Night\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson.

When they took breaks from playing, Drozd would have a really tough time with his withdrawal.  Listening to him cry, and with the death of his father in mind, Coyne wrote: \"Do You Realize??\".\nWayne Coyne, commenting on \"Do You Realize??\" said, \"Whenever I analyze the scientific realities of what it means to be living here on Earth – in this galaxy – spinning around the sun – flying through space – a terror shock seizes me!!!

However, on 23 April 2009, a vote in the Oklahoma House of Representatives fell three votes short of the 51 votes necessary to ratify the resolution: one Republican state legislator attacked the band for its use of offensive language, while another said he opposed the song because band member Michael Ivins had worn a red T-shirt with a yellow sickle and hammer during a previous appearance by the band. Democratic Governor Brad Henry subsequently announced that he would issue an executive order in lieu of the resolution rejected by the Oklahoma House. However, it was revealed in 2013 that Republican Governor Mary Fallin removed the song's designation as the Official Rock Song of Oklahoma by not renewing Brad Henry's executive order upon taking office in 2011.\n\nCommercial appearances\nHewlett-Packard featured the band alongside Penn and Teller in its 2002 commercial for its HP Media Center PC, which included a clip of the music video.

The film was directed by Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by John Fusco, based on an idea by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who produced the film alongside Mireille Soria.Set in the Old West in the late 19th century, the film follows Spirit, a Kiger mustang stallion (voiced by Matt Damon as a narrator), who is captured during the American Indian Wars by the United States Cavalry; he is eventually freed by a Lakota man named Little Creek with whom he bonds, as well as a mare named Rain. In contrast to the anthropomorphic style of animal characters in other animated features, Spirit and his fellow horses communicate with each other through non-linguistic sounds and body language (albeit with many human facial expressions and reactions).\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was released in cinemas on May 24, 2002 and was a box-office disappointment, earning only $122 million on an $80 million budget. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Spirited Away. The film also launched a media franchise using computer animation, with a Netflix spin-off television series Spirit Riding Free premiering on May 5, 2017, followed by  a spin-off of the original film, titled Spirit Untamed, released on June 4, 2021.\n\nPlot\nIn the 19th-century American West, a Kiger mustang colt, Spirit, is born to a herd of wild horses; he grows into a stallion and assumes the leadership of the herd. One night, upon following a strange light near his herd, Spirit finds horses tied to a log and their wranglers sleeping around a campfire. They awake and, after a chase, capture him and take him to a US cavalry fort.\nThe leader of the fort, the Colonel, orders Spirit to be broken; however, Spirit defies all attempts. The Colonel retaliates by having him tied to a post for three days without food or water. Meanwhile, a Lakota Native American named Little Creek is also brought into the fort and held captive. After three days, Spirit is weak enough that the Colonel takes control of him, boasting that any wild horse can eventually be tamed, but seeing the disappointment in the other captive horses, Spirit gets a second wind and throws him off. Humiliated and livid, the Colonel is about to shoot him before Little Creek frees himself from his bonds with a knife and saves Spirit; they escape, releasing the other horses in the process. However, Little Creek catches Spirit himself and takes him to his village.\nAfter returning to the Lakota village, Little Creek attempts to tame Spirit with kindness, but Spirit still refuses to be broken. Little Creek ties Spirit with his mare Rain, hoping she can discipline him. Spirit eventually falls in love with Rain despite not understanding her attachment to humans. Soon, Little Creek and Spirit come to a mutual respect and the former realizes that the horse will never be tamed, so he lets Spirit go. Spirit is about to return to his herd and convince Rain to come with him when he notices the Colonel and his men charging to attack the village. During the battle, at which Spirit returns to help, the Colonel shoots Rain and she falls into a river; he is about to shoot Little Creek, but Spirit knocks the Colonel off his horse, deflecting the shot and saving his life. Spirit then runs after Rain in attempts to rescue her, but they both plummet over a waterfall. Spirit stays by Rain's side, only for the cavalry to recapture him but leave her for dead. Little Creek tends to Rain and vows to free Spirit in return for his life being saved by him.\nBroken, Spirit is put in a train with other captured horses from the village and loses his self-worth. However, he has a vision of his family from his homeland running free, strengthening him again. Spirit is forced to work on the transcontinental railroad, pulling a steam locomotive with other horses. After noticing that the railroad will pass right through his home, Spirit quickly breaks free from the sledge and then frees the other horses. They all escape, but the loss of the horses causes the locomotive come tumbling down the hill with Spirit running for his life from it. It crashes into a station and into another locomotive, causing an explosion that sets the forest ablaze. Spirit is trapped when the chain around his neck snags on a fallen tree. Little Creek intervenes setting him free, and together they escape by jumping into a ravine.\nThe next morning, the Colonel and his cavalry find Spirit and Little Creek and a chase ensues through the Grand Canyon, where they get trapped on one side of a gorge. Spirit makes an incredible leap to the other side, and his bravery amazes the Colonel; he stops one of his privates from shooting Spirit, and humbly accepts defeat and leaves them be. Celebrating their victory & freedom, Little Creek returns to the Lakota village with Spirit and finds Rain nursed back to health, and names the stallion \"Spirit Who Could Not Be Broken\". Spirit and Rain are then set loose by Little Creek; they depart to Spirit's homeland, where they reunite with his herd.\n\nCast\nMatt Damon as Spirit, a Kiger mustang horse\nJames Cromwell as The Colonel, leader of a cavalry of soldiers.

He remained on the project as the main writer over the course of four years, working closely with Katzenberg, the directors, and artists.\n\nAnimation and design\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was made over the course of four years using a conscious blend of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer animation. James Baxter said that the animation was the most difficult piece of production he worked on for a movie: \"I literally spent the first few weeks with my door shut, telling everyone, 'Go away; I've got to concentrate.' It was quite daunting because when I first started to draw horses, I suddenly realized how little I knew.\" The team at DreamWorks, under his guidance, used a horse named \"Donner\"aloza and Lead Designer Justin Prate was released online in July 2013, after a month-long beta testing.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nToo Many Cooks (TV series)\nToo Many Cooks is a British cookery competition that aired on ITV from 1 November 2004 to 4 September 2005 and hosted by Kate Garraway for the first series and Jeni Barnett for the second series. The judges for the first series were Brian Turner and James Martin while the second series judges were Gino D'Acampo, Richard Phillips and Alex MacKay.\n\nFormat\nFour teams of two people competitively cook for three judges. Each team is told what to cook and are given ten minutes to cook a starter, twenty minutes to cook a main course, and ten minutes to cook a pudding. A couple is eliminated after each course, leaving two teams to compete at the pudding stage.\n\nTransmissions\nExternal links\nToo Many Cooks at UKGameshows.com\nPassage 2:\nLa cuisine en dix minutes\nLa cuisine en dix minutes, ou l'Adaptation au rhythme moderne (English title: French Cooking in Ten Minutes, or, Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life, also Cooking in Ten Minutes, or, Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life) by Édouard de Pomiane, published in 1930, was an early and influential title on the subject of convenience cooking. It attempted to render many of the basic techniques of classic French cooking into a quick form for people who did not have time to cook.\nCompared to modern convenience cookbooks, almost everything is from scratch, though a good number of recipes call for canned vegetables (a modern cook might use frozen vegetables instead) as well as commercially available charcuterie products such as sausages and pâté. De Pomiane also adopts a rather tongue-in-cheek approach to writing and admonishes the reader to limit complexity and plan carefully.\nThe book has been translated into several languages. The first German translation appeared in 1935, the first English translation in 1948. The book is still popular, particularly in the English speaking part of the world. The latest English edition appeared in 2008, in 2010 the British Newspaper The Observer put it on rank 41 on its list of the 50 best cookbooks of all time.\nPassage 3:\nWest Coast Express (ice hockey)\nThe West Coast Express was an ice hockey line that played for the National Hockey League's (NHL) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006. Named after Vancouver's commuter rail service, the line consisted of captain Markus Näslund at left-wing, Brendan Morrison at centre, and Todd Bertuzzi playing right-wing. The West Coast Express was a high scoring line that was considered to be one of the best lines in hockey during its tenure.\nEach player was acquired by the Canucks through various trades. Once each member arrived in Vancouver it took two years before the line played together regularly. Once they did, they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002–03 season (later surpassed), a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line. Despite regular season success, the Canucks were never able to advance past the second round of the playoffs during the West Coast Express years. The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005–06 season. Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007–08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency.\n\nHistory\nPlayer acquisitions\nThe Vancouver Canucks made the Stanley Cup Finals in 1994, but proceeded to regress as a franchise progressively finishing worse each season. As such they began attempting to add skill players to the line-up through trades. The Canucks made various deals to \"move the program forward and in a different direction\". With the franchise moving in a new direction the first member of the West Coast Express line arrived in Vancouver on March 20, 1996, when left wing Markus Naslund was traded to the Canucks by the Pittsburgh Penguins for Alek Stojanov. Naslund struggled to start his Canucks career and during the 1997–98 season he requested to be traded. It was not until the 1998–99 season that Naslund emerged as an offensive leader with the Canucks, leading them in goals (36) and points (66).Todd Bertuzzi was the second member of the line to join the Canucks' franchise, when he was acquired by Vancouver via a trade during the 1997–98 season. The New York Islanders received former Canuck captain Trevor Linden in exchange for right winger Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu). Bertuzzi began the 1998–99 season playing on a line with Mark Messier at centre and Alexander Mogilny on right wing. Bertuzzi played with the two until he suffered a fractured tibia, an injury that resulted in Naslund gaining increased ice time.\nThe final piece came to the Canucks on March 14, 2000, with the acquisition of Brendan Morrison. In an attempt to improve their team to make a Stanley Cup run, the New Jersey Devils traded Morrison and centre Denis Pederson for Mogilny at the National Hockey League's (NHL) trade deadline. Upon his arrival Morrison did not begin playing with Naslund and Bertuzzi nor did he begin his Canucks' career at centre, instead he began on the wing.\n\nExpress years\nAlthough the three did not begin playing together immediately,  Bertuzzi and Naslund regularly played together on the top line with centres Mark Messier and Andrew Cassels. Starting with their arrival in 2000, head coach Marc Crawford often moved Bertuzzi to the second line to play with twin brothers Henrik and Daniel Sedin to complement their cycling game. Morrison spent time on the third line with agitator Matt Cooke. Morrison joined Naslund on the top line due to an injury to Cassels in early November of the 2001–02 season, the two were joined by Trent Klatt on right wing, with Bertuzzi playing on a line with the twins.  During the game Bertuzzi joined Naslund and Morrison on a power play marking one of the first times the line was together. The Canucks won the game but the line did not remain together as Cassels returned from injury, Klatt was injured and Bertuzzi was returned to the second line. The first game the trio played together as a regular line was on January 9, 2002. In the game they registered two first period goals in a 5–4 loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Crawford liked the idea of having his two top scorers together, how Morrison worked with them on the power play, and felt Morrison could handle the demands of playing with two players who wanted the puck. In their second game together the line continued to its strong play as each member recordedfilm length made other film choices \"even more attractive.\" Common Sense Media gave the film a 1 out of 5 stars and wrote that the \"Faux holiday-themed sequel is weak and forgettable.\"Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games, based on the Winter Olympics and directed by Richard Rich, was released on iTunes on March 4, 2014, and it was later released on March 25, 2014 as a Walmart Exclusive. Common Sense Media gave Alpha and Omega 3 a mixed review, with three out of five stars, writing that the \"mildly amusing sports-themed sequel is fun for young kids.\" The film was released shortly after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on which it is based.\nAlpha and Omega: The Legend of the Saw Tooth Cave was produced by Crest Animation Productions and distributed by Lionsgate Films. Written by Tom Kane and directed by Richard Rich, it is the fourth film in the franchise. The film was released to iTunes on September 23, 2014 and was released to DVD on October 7, 2014. The plot involves Runt exploring the Saw Tooth Cave and finding a wolf who has been driven from her pack for being different. He must help her and he learns about the joys of lending a paw to a friend in need. The trailer for Alpha and Omega: The Legend of the Saw Tooth Cave was released on July 21, 2014. The film was officially announced in the DVD features of Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure, along with The Great Wolf Games, with director Richard Rich showing two short clips from the storyboards of both films. Common Sense Media gave the film 3 out of 5, stating \"Entertaining wolf sequel has peril and some scares\".The fifth film in the franchise, Alpha and Omega: Family Vacation, aired on TV in Mexico on March 28 and was released to DVD on August 4, 2015. It is written by Tom Kane and directed by Richard Rich. It aired in Mexico on March 28, 2015 before having its DVD premiere on August 4. The plot involves Kate, Humphrey, and the pups attempting to have a vacation together, but must flee from human wolf trappers in the process, and recaps the events as flashback scenes from past movies even the first film except for one alteration scene of the first film. Common Sense Media gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, stating \"Adorable wolves take on trappers; some peril, suspense.\"On April 8, 2015, three more sequels were announced for Lionsgate to distribute, the first of which was released in early 2016, and followed the \"misadventures of Alpha Kate and Omega Humphrey and their three wolf pups, Stinky, Claudette and Runt, as they learn life lessons in the great outdoors\".On October 6, 2015, on Splash Entertainment's website, they have revealed the next sequel titled Alpha and Omega: The Big Fureeze along with sneak preview clips of the film, which was released in 2016. The other two sequel titles have also been revealed as, in order, Alpha and Omega: Dino Digs and Alpha and Omega: Journey to Bear Kingdom.Alpha and Omega: Dino Digs was released on DVD and Digital HD on May 10, 2016. Alpha and Omega: The Big Fureeze was released on DVD and Digital HD on November 8, 2016. Alpha and Omega: Journey to Bear Kingdom was released on May 9, 2017.\nPassage 8:\nTen Minutes Older\nTen Minutes Older is a 2002 film project consisting of two compilation feature films titled The Trumpet and The Cello. The project was conceived by the producer Nicolas McClintock as a reflection on the theme of time at the turn of the Millennium. Fifteen celebrated filmmakers were invited to create their own vision of what time means in ten minutes of film. The music for the compilations was composed by Paul Englishby, and performed by Hugh Masekela (trumpet) and Claudio Bohorques (cello).\nThe Trumpet was first screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. The Cello was premiered in the official Venice Film Festival 2002. Both films released internationally The two films are dedicated to Herz Frank and Juris Podnieks (Camera) who made the 1978 short film, Ten Minutes Older.

The mine uses an electronic microprocessor controlled fuze with magnetic, seismic and pressure sensors allowing it to discriminate between targets. The mine can be laid by hand or by a mechanical mine laying system, and arms ten minutes after being laid. The mine is fitted with an anti-handling device, and can be command detonated.\nWhen triggered, the mine detonates a small clearing charge, which clears away any earth laid on top of the mine. It then fires the main warhead, which uses a metal liner to form a penetrating fragment which is projected into the belly of the vehicle passing over the mine.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nVocal fry register\nThe vocal fry register (also known as pulse register, laryngealization, pulse phonation, creaky voice, creak, croak, popcorning, glottal fry, glottal rattle, glottal scrape) is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure that permits air to bubble through slowly with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. During this phonation, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together, which causes the vocal folds to compress rather tightly and become relatively slack and compact. This process forms a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds that produces the characteristic low popping or rattling sound when air passes through the glottal closure. The register (if well controlled) can extend far below the modal voice register, in some cases up to 8 octaves lower, such as in the case of Tim Storms who holds the world record for lowest frequency note ever produced by a human, a G−7, which is only 0.189 Hz, inaudible to the human ear.\nVocal fry is thought to have become more common among young female speakers of American English in the early 21st century, with the style of speaking being considered informal, nonaggressive and urban-oriented.\n\nHistory of register classification\nThe vocal fry register has been a recognized and identifiable register in American English only within the past few decades, but its characteristic sound was recognized much earlier. Discussion of the vocal fry or pulse register began first within the field of phonetics and speech therapy and did not enter the vocabulary of vocal music pedagogists until the early 1970s, when it was initially controversial. However, the controversy surrounding the term within vocal music has subsided as more research into the use of the vocal fry register within the context of singing ensued. In particular, vocal pedagogist Margaret Greene's videotaping of the physiological processes occurring in the body while singers were phonating in the vocal fry register offered solid evidence that this type of vocal phonation should be considered a vocal register from both speech pathology and vocal music perspectives. Like any other vocal register, the vocal fry register has a unique vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound that distinguishes it from other vocal registers.\n\nIn speech\nDiscussion of vocal fry is much more frequent in books related to phonetics and speech therapy than it is in those dealing with singing. Some authorities consider the use of vocal fry in speech a dysphonia, but others consider it so only if it is used excessively such as Hollien, Moore, Wendahl, and Michel:\n\nIt is simply our intent to suggest that ordinarily vocal fry constitutes one of several physiologically available types of voice production on the frequency-pitch continuum and hence, of itself, is not logically classified among the laryngeal pathologies. While the excessive use of fry could result in a diagnosis of voice disorder, this quality is too often heard in normal voices (especially in descending inflections where the voice fundamentally falls below frequencies in the modal register) to be exclusively a disorder.\nMany are quick to point out that although vocal fry is minimally a part of routine speaking patterns, the continued use of such a pattern makes it non-utilitarian or pathological.Some evidence exists of vocal fry becoming more common in the speech of young female speakers of American English in the early 21st century, but its frequency's extent and significance are disputed. Researcher Ikuko Patricia Yuasa suggests that the tendency is a product of young women trying to infuse their speech with gravitas by means of reaching for the male register and found that \"college-age Americans ... perceive female creaky voice as hesitant, nonaggressive, and informal but also educated, urban-oriented, and upwardly mobile.\"A 2014 national study of American adults found that speech with vocal fry was perceived more negatively than a voice without vocal fry, particularly in a labor market context. In young adult women, it was perceived as sounding less trustworthy, less competent, less attractive, and less hireable. The negative evaluation was stronger when the evaluator was also a woman.The national study of 800 listeners across age groups found that people making hiring decisions preferred a voice without vocal fry to one with vocal fry. A limitation of the study was that the vocal fry samples were produced by imitators rather than natural vocal fry speakers. That suggests that more research is needed, as the negative reaction could be attributable to other factors.In native speakers of American English, young women use vocal fry more frequently than men. When asked to read a passage, female speakers used vocal fry at a rate four times higher than male speakers.Some languages, such as Jalapa Mazatec, use vocal fry (creaky voice) as a linguistically significant marker; the presence or absence of vocal fry can then change the meaning of a word.\n\nSocial implications\nSome people seek out the help of speech pathologists as they feel vocal fry makes them appear unsure and less confident. Researchers have found that young adult women who use vocal fry are perceived as less competent and less hireable (listeners have less of a negative reaction to male voices). Others argue that these perceptions are part of a broader attack on women's speech.Vocal fry is generally seen as a negative characteristic in the workplace, but a study by Duke University researchers has determined the phenomenon is becoming more common and socially acceptable.\n\nIn singing\nThe croaking sound produced by male singers at the start of phrases in American country music is produced by moving from this to the modal register. Within choral music, when true basses are not available, choirs often rely on singers who can \"fry\" the low bass notes. Singers such as Tim Storms, Mike Holcomb and various other gospel basses use this technique to sing very low tones.  Some styles of folk singing showcase the vocal fry register in the female voice. Vocal fry is also used in metal music, usually in combination with air from the diaphragm, in order to create a \"growl\" or \"scream,\" which sounds aggressive and harsh.The chief use of the vocal fry register in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency, which are not available to the singer in the modal register. The physiological production of the vocal fry register may be extended up into the modal register. In some cases, vocal pedagogues have found the use of vocal fry therapeutically helpful to students who have trouble producing lower notes. Singers often lose their low notes or never learn to produce them because of the excessive tension of the laryngeal muscles and of the support mechanism that leads to too much breath pressure.Some throat singing styles such as kargyra use vocal techniques similar to vocal fry.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nBass (voice type)\nA bass is a type of classical male singing voice and has the lowest vocal range of all voice types. According to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, a bass is typically classified as having a vocal range extending from around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C (i.e., E2–E4). Its tessitura, orvoice. For classical and operatic singers, their voice type determines the roles they will sing and is a primary method of categorization. In classical music, a \"pure\" contralto is considered the rarest type of female voice. In non-classical music, singers are primarily defined by their genre and their gender, not their vocal range. When the terms soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, tenor, baritone, and bass are used as descriptors of non-classical voices, they are applied more loosely than they would be to those of classical singers and generally refer only to the singer's perceived vocal range. Contemporarily, the informal term alto is sometimes used interchangeably with contralto.The following is a list of singers in country, popular music, jazz, and musical theatre who have been described as contraltos.\n\nList of names\nSee also\nList of mezzo-sopranos in non-classical music\nList of sopranos in non-classical music\nList of basses in non-classical music\nList of baritones in non-classical music\nList of tenors in non-classical music\nList of operatic contraltos\nVoice classification in non-classical music\nVoice type\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nGeorgia Brown (Brazilian singer)\nRossana Monti, better known by the stage name Georgia Brown, is a Brazilian singer noted for her extensive vocal range.\n\nCareer\nAt the age of fifteen, Brown toured as backup vocalist for Brazilian singer Jorge Ben, during his \"W Brasil Tour\" in 1995. Following the conclusion of the tour, she entered in contests \"Skol Rock\" and \"Fest Valda\". In 1997, Brown relocated to California in the United States of America to begin recording her first album. In 2001, Brown released her debut album \"Black Nature\". The album spawned the singles: \"Commit A Crime\" and \"Hold On\". Following the release of her debut album, she headlined her first tour \"Black Nature Tour\". In 2002, \"Black Nature\" was certified gold in Brazil with sales in excess of 120,000 copies.\nIn 2003, she released a single \"Forgiven\". The song was remixed by DJ Patife and featured on his album \"Na Estrada\", released in 2005. In 2004, she released her second album Heart Beats, which became certified platinum in Brazil. She headlined first international tour \"Heart Beats World Tour\" in 2004. In the same year, Brown broke American singer Mariah Carey's vocal records on Guinness World Records and received a certificate for two records: \"World's Greatest Vocal Range by a Female B2-F8\" and \"World's Highest Note \"F8\".In 2006, Brown began recording her third album. In 2008, she released her third studio album The Renascence of Soul. In 2010, Brown released house music single titled \"Love 4 Real\". In 2012, she released an extended play entitled Me & Myself.\nIn July 2018, Brown released a single \"#HighVibration (Sweet Sensation)\".\n\nDiscography\nAlbumsBlack Nature (2001)\nHeart Beats (2004)\nThe Renascence of Soul (2008)\nMe & Myself – EP (2012)Singles\"Commit A Crime\" (2001)\n\"Hold On\" (2001)\n\"Forgiven\" (2003)\n\"Lost Love\" (2004)\n\"Art A Shield for Me\" (2008)\n\"Save My Soul\" (2008)\n\"Loneliness\" (2009)\n\"Love 4 Real\" (2010)\n\"#HighVibration (Sweet Sensation)\" (2018)\nPassage 10:\nRange (music)\nIn music, the range, or chromatic range, of a musical instrument is the distance from the lowest to the highest pitch it can play. For a singing voice, the equivalent is vocal range. The range of a musical part is the distance between its lowest and highest note.\n\nCompass\nAmong British English speakers, and perhaps others, compass means the same thing as chromatic range—the interval between the lowest and highest note attainable by a voice or musical instrument.\n\nOther ranges\nThe terms  sounding range, written range,  designated range, duration range and dynamic range have specific meanings.\nThe sounding range refers to the pitches produced by an instrument, while the written range refers to the compass (span) of notes written in the sheet music, where the part is sometimes transposed for convenience. A piccolo, for example, typically has a sounding range one octave higher than its written range. The designated range is the set of notes the player should or can achieve while playing. All instruments have a designated range, and all pitched instruments have a playing range. Timbre, dynamics, and duration ranges are interrelated and one may achieve registral range at the expense of timbre. The designated range is thus the range in which a player is expected to have comfortable control of all aspects.\nThe duration range is the difference between the shortest and longest rhythm used. Dynamic range is the difference between the quietest and loudest volume of an instrument, part or piece of music.\n\nRange limits\nAlthough woodwind instruments and string instruments have no theoretical upper limit to their range (subject to practical limits), they generally cannot go below their designated range.  Brass instruments, on the other hand, can play beyond their designated ranges. Notes lower than the brass instrument's designated range are called pedal tones. The playing range of a brass instrument depends on both the technical limitations of the instrument and the skill of the player.\nClassical arrangements seldom make woodwind or brass instruments play beyond their designed range. String musicians play the bottom of their ranges very frequently, but the top of a string instrument's range is rather fuzzy, and it is unusual for a string player to exceed the designated range. It is quite rare for wind musicians to play the extremes of their instruments. The most common exception is that in many 20th century works, pedal tones are called for in bass trombones.\nThis chart uses standard numberings for octaves where middle C corresponds to C4. In the MIDI language middle C is referred to as MIDI note number 60.\nThe lowest note that a pipe organ can sound (with a true pipe) is C−1 (or CCCC), which is 8 Hz, below the range of human hearing and not visible on this chart. However, if acoustic combination (a note and its fifth) counts, the lowest note is C−2 (or CCCCC), which is 4 Hz.\nIn terms of recording and reproduction, many speakers have a low limit of around 40–60 Hz.\n\nTypical ranges\n*This chart only displays down to C0, though some pipe organs, such as the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ, extend down to C−1 (one octave below C0). Also, the fundamental frequency of the subcontrabass tuba is B♭−1.\n\nSee also\nTessitura\nExtension (music)\nSub-bass\nHearing range\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nArnold Bennett\nEnoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 – 27 March 1931) was an English author, best known as a novelist who wrote prolifically. Between the 1890s and the 1930s he completed 34 novels, seven volumes of short stories, 13 plays (some in collaboration with other writers), and a daily journal totalling more than a million words. He wrote articles and stories for more than 100 newspapers and periodicals, worked in and briefly ran the Ministry of Information in the First World War, and wrote for the cinema in the 1920s. Sales of his books were substantial and he was the most financially successful British author of his day.\nBorn into a modest but upwardly mobile family in Hanley, in the Staffordshire Potteries, Bennett was intended by his father, a solicitor, to follow him into the legal profession. Bennett worked for his father, before moving to another law firm in London as a clerk, aged 21. He became assistant editor and then editor of a women's magazine, before becoming a full-time author in 1900. Always a devotee of French culture in general and French literature in particular, he moved to Paris in 1903; there the relaxed milieu helped him overcome his intense shyness, particularly with women. He spent ten years in France, marrying a Frenchwoman in 1907. In 1912 he moved back to England. He and his wife separated in 1921 and he spent the last years of his life with a new partner, an English actress. He died in 1931 of typhoid fever, having unwisely drunk tap-water in France.\nMany of Bennett's novels and short stories are set in a fictionalised version of the Staffordshire Potteries, which he called The Five Towns. He strongly believed that literature should be accessible to ordinary people, and he deplored literary cliques and élites. His books appealed to a wide public and sold in large numbers. For this reason, and for his adherence to realism, writers and supporters of the modernist school, notably Virginia Woolf, belittled him, and his fiction became neglected after his death. During his lifetime his journalistic \"self-help\" books sold in substantial numbers, and he was also a playwright; he did less well in the theatre than with novels, but achieved two considerable successes with Milestones (1912) and The Great Adventure (1913).\nStudies by Margaret Drabble (1974), John Carey (1992) and others have led to a re-evaluation of Bennett's work. His finest novels, including Anna of the Five Towns (1902), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Clayhanger (1910) and Riceyman Steps (1923), are now widely recognised as major works.\n\nLife and career\nEarly years\nArnold Bennett was born on 27 May 1867 in Hanley, Staffordshire, now part of Stoke-on-Trent but then a separate town. He was the eldest child of the three sons and three daughters of Enoch Bennett (1843–1902) and his wife Sarah Ann, née Longson (1840–1914). Enoch Bennett's early career had been one of mixed fortunes: after an unsuccessful attempt to run a business making and selling pottery, he set up as a draper and pawnbroker in 1866. Four years later Enoch's father died, leaving him some money with which he articled himself to a local law firm; in 1876 he qualified as a solicitor. The Bennetts were staunch Wesleyans, musical, cultured and sociable. Enoch Bennett had an authoritarian side, but it was a happy household, although a mobile one: as Enoch's success as a solicitor increased, the family moved, within the space of five years in the late 1870s and early 1880s, to four different houses in Hanley and the neighbouring Burslem.From 1877 to 1882, Bennett's schooling was at the Wedgwood Institute, Burslem, followed by a year at a grammar school in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He was good at Latin and better at French; he had an inspirational headmaster who gave him a love for French literature and the French language that lasted all his life. He did well academically and passed Cambridge University examinations that could have led to an Oxbridge education, but his father had other plans. In 1883, aged 16, Bennett left school and began work – unpaid – in his father's office. He divided his time between uncongenial jobs, such as rent collecting, during the day, and studying for examinations in the evening. He began writing in a modest way, contributing light pieces to the local newspaper. He became adept in Pitman's shorthand, a skill much sought after in commercial offices, and on the strength of that he secured a post as a clerk at a firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. In March 1889, aged 21, he left for London and never returned to live in his native county.\n\nFirst years in London\nIn the solicitors' office in London, Bennett became friendly with a young colleague, John Eland, who had a passion for books. Eland's friendship helped alleviate Bennett's innate shyness, which was exacerbated by a lifelong stammer. Together they explored the world of literature. Among the writers who impressed and influenced Bennett were George Moore, Émile Zola, Honoré de Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, Gustave Flaubert and Ivan Turgenev. He continued his own writing, and won a prize of twenty guineas from Tit-Bits in 1893 for his story 'The Artist's Model'; another short story, 'A Letter Home', was submitted successfully to The Yellow Book, where it featured in 1895 alongside contributions from Henry James and other well-known writers.In 1894 Bennett resigned from the law firm and became assistant editor of the magazine Woman. The salary, £150 a year, was £50 less than he was earning as a clerk, but the post left him much more free time to write his first novel. For the magazine he wrote under a range of female pen-names such as \"Barbara\" and \"Cecile\". As his biographer Margaret Drabble puts it:\n\nThe informal office life of the magazine suited Bennett, not least because it brought him into lively female company, and he began to be a little more relaxed with young women. He continued work on his novel and wrote short stories and articles. He was modest about his literary talent: he wrote to a friend, \"I have no inward assurance that I could ever do anything more than mediocre viewed strictly as art – very mediocre\", but he knew he could \"turn out things which would be read with zest, & about which the man in the street would say to friends 'Have you read so & so in the What-is-it?'\" He was happy to write forsociety, and to promote social hygiene. For Ellis, sterilization seemed to be the only eugenic instrument that could be used on the mentally unfit. In fact, in his publication The Sterilization of the Unfit, Ellis argued that even institutionalization could not guarantee the complete prevention of procreation between the unfit, and thus, \"the burdens of society, to say nothing of the race, are being multiplied. It is not possible to view sterilization with enthusiasm when applied to any class of people…but what, I ask myself, is the practical alternative?\"\n\nPsychedelics\nEllis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. He consumed a brew made of three Lophophora williamsii buds in the afternoon of Good Friday alone in his set of rooms in Temple, London. During the experience, lasting for about 24 hours, he noted a plethora of extremely vivid, complex, colourful, pleasantly smelling hallucinations, consisting both of abstract geometrical patterns and objects such as butterflies and other insects. He published the account of the experience in The Contemporary Review in 1898 (Mescal: A New Artificial Paradise). The title of the article alludes to an earlier work on the effects of mind-altering substances, an 1860 book Les Paradis artificiels by French poet Charles Baudelaire (containing descriptions of experiments with opium and hashish).\nEllis was so impressed with the aesthetic quality of the experience that he gave some specimens of peyote to the Irish poet W.B. Yeats, a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an organisation of which another mescaline researcher, Aleister Crowley, was also a member.\n\nLater life and death\nEllis resigned from his position as a Fellow of the Eugenics Society over its stance on sterilization in January 1931.Ellis spent the last year of his life at Hintlesham, Suffolk, where he died in July 1939. His ashes were scattered at Golders Green Crematorium, North London, following his cremation.\n\nWorks\nThe Criminal (1890)\nThe New Spirit (1890)\nThe Nationalisation of Health (1892)\nMan and Woman: A Study of Secondary and Tertiary Sexual Characteristics (1894) (revised 1929)\nDas konträre Geschlechtsgefühl (in German).

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nNanyue\nNanyue (Chinese: 南越 or 南粵; pinyin: Nányuè; Jyutping: Naam4 Jyut6; lit. 'Southern Yue'), was an ancient kingdom ruled by Chinese monarchs of the Zhao family that covered the modern Chinese subdivisions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong, Macau, southern Fujian and central to northern Vietnam. Nanyue was established by Zhao Tuo, then Commander of Nanhai of the Qin Empire, in 204 BC after the collapse of the Qin dynasty. At first, it consisted of the commanderies Nanhai, Guilin, and Xiang.\nIn 196 BC, Zhao Tuo paid obeisance to the Emperor Gaozu of Han, and Nanyue was referred to by the Han dynasty as a \"foreign servant\", i.e. a vassal state. Around 183 BC, relations between the Nanyue and the Han dynasty soured, and Zhao Tuo began to refer to himself as an emperor, suggesting an equal status between Nanyue and the Han dynasty. In 179 BC, relations between the Han and Nanyue improved, and Zhao Tuo once again made submission, this time to Emperor Wen of Han as a subject state. The submission was somewhat superficial, as Nanyue retained autonomy from the Han, and Zhao Tuo was referred to as \"Emperor\" throughout Nanyue until his death. In 113 BC, fourth-generation leader Zhao Xing sought to have Nanyue formally included as part of the Han Empire. His prime minister Lü Jia objected vehemently and subsequently killed Zhao Xing, installing his elder brother Zhao Jiande on the throne and forcing a confrontation with the Han dynasty. The next year, Emperor Wu of Han sent 100,000 troops to war against Nanyue. By the year's end, the army had destroyed Nanyue and established Han rule. The dynastic state lasted 93 years and had five generations of monarchs.\nThe existence of Nanyue allowed the Lingnan region to avoid the chaos and hardship surrounding the collapse of the Qin dynasty experienced by the northern, predominantly Han Chinese regions. The kingdom was founded by leaders originally from the Central Plain of China and were all of Han Chinese in origin. They were responsible for bringing Chinese-style bureaucracy and handicraft techniques to inhabitants of  southern regions, as well as knowledge of the Chinese language and writing system. Nanyue rulers promoted a policy of \"Harmonizing and Gathering the Hundred Yue tribes\" (Chinese: 和集百越), and encouraged ethnic Han to immigrate from the Yellow River region to the south. Nanyue rulers were then not against the assimilation of Yue and Han cultures.In Vietnam, the rulers of Nanyue are referred to as the Triệu dynasty. The name \"Vietnam\" (Việt Nam) is derived and reversed from Nam Việt, the Vietnamese pronunciation of Nanyue.\n\nHistory\nA detailed history of Nanyue was written in Records of the Grand Historian by Han dynasty historian Sima Qian.  It is mostly contained in section (juan) 113, Chinese: 南越列傳; pinyin: Nányuè Liè Zhuàn; Jyutping: Naam4jyut6 Lit6 Zyun2 (Ordered Annals of Nanyue). A similar record is also found in the Book of Han Volume 95: The Southwest Peoples, Two Yues, and Chaoxian.\n\nFounding\nQin southward expansion (218 BC)\nAfter Qin Shi Huang conquered the six other Chinese kingdoms of Han, Zhao, Wei, Chu, Yan, and Qi, he turned his attention to the Xiongnu tribes of the north and west and the Hundred Yue peoples of what is now southern China. Around 218 BC, the First Emperor dispatched General Tu Sui with an army of 500,000 Qin soldiers to divide into five companies and attack the Hundred Yue tribes of the Lingnan region. The first company gathered at Yuhan (Modern Yugan County in Jiangxi Province) and attacked the Minyue, defeating them and establishing the Minzhong Commandery. The second company fortified at Nanye (in modern Jiangxi Province's Nankang County), and was designed to put defensive pressure on the southern clans. The third company occupied Panyu.  The fourth company garrisoned near the Jiuyi Mountains, and the fifth company garrisoned outside Tancheng (in the southwest part of modern Hunan Province's Jingzhou Miao and Dong Autonomous County). The First Emperor assigned official Shi Lu to oversee supply logistics.  Shi first led a regiment of soldiers through the Ling Channel (which connected the Xiang River and the Li River), then navigated through the Yangtze River and Pearl River water systems ensure the safety of the Qin supply routes. The Qin attack of the Western Valley (Chinese: 西甌) Yue tribe went smoothly, and Western Valley chieftain Yi-Xu-Song was killed. However, the Western Valley Yue were unwilling to submit to the Qin and fled into the jungle where they selected a new leader to continue resisting the Chinese armies. Later, a night-time counterattack by the Western Valley Yue devastated the Qin troops, and General Tu Sui was killed in the fighting. The Qin suffered heavy losses, and the imperial court selected General Zhao Tuo to assume command of the Chinese army. In 214 BC, the First Emperor dispatched Ren Xiao and Zhao Tuo at the head of reinforcements to once again mount an attack. This time, the Western Valley Yue were completely defeated, and the Lingnan region was brought entirely under Chinese control. In the same year, the Qin court established the Nanhai, Guilin, and Xiang Commanderies, and Ren Xiao was made Lieutenant of Nanhai. Nanhai was further divided into Panyu, Longchuan, Boluo, and Jieyang counties (among several others), and Zhao Tuo was made magistrate of Longchuan.\nThe First Emperor died in 210 BC, and his son Zhao Huhai became the Second Emperor of Qin. The following year, soldiers Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, and others seized the opportunity to revolt against the Qin government. Insurrections spread throughout much of China (including those led by Xiang Yu and Liu Bang, who would later face off over the founding of the next dynasty) and the entire Yellow River region devolved into chaos. Soon after the first insurrections, Nanhai Lieutenant Ren Xiao became gravely ill and summoned Zhao Tuo to hear his dying instructions. Ren described the natural advantages of the southern region and described how a kingdom could be founded with the many Chinese settlers in the area to combat the warring groups in the Chinese north. He drafted a decree instating Zhao Tuo as the new Lieutenant of Nanhai, and died soon afterward.\nAfter Ren's death, Zhao Tuo, sent orders to his troops in Hengpu Pass (nthe Dian people, such as bullfighting, dancing and music-making. The Dian people dressed in tunics over short pants and wore their hair in topknots. The bronze lids corroborated Sima Qian's description of the Dian hairstyle.\nMany scenes depicted the Dian at war, often riding horses. Archaeological evidence shows that horses had been domesticated by the Dian people as early as the sixth century BCE. The bronze lids also depicted the Dian decapitating their enemies (who wore their hair in long plaits).\nThe Kingdom was based on agriculture, the bronzes also showed head hunting, human sacrifice, and slaves as part of Dian society.\n\nUnderwater ruins\nArchaeologists recently discovered the inundated remains of Dian-period buildings and pottery fragments under Fuxian Lake and were able to verify their age with carbon dating.\n\nOther artifacts\nAt Dabona, a site connected with the Dian culture, archaeologists discovered a large double coffin burial; The outer coffin was made of wood and the inner coffin was made of bronze. The inner coffin was shaped like a house and weighs over 157 kg.\nThe Yunnan Provincial Museum holds many archaeological relics of the Dian culture.\n\nGallery\nPassage 7:\nGo dynasty\nGo Royal Family (Reigned from 37 BC to 668 AD) was the dynasty that founded and ruled over the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Its founder, Jumong (Korean: 주몽; Hanja: 朱蒙), broke away from another ancient Korean kingdom called Dongbuyeo to start his own kingdom. The Taewangs were all members of the Go Royal Family.\n\nAncestry of Jumong\nJumong was the 4th generation descendant of Hae Mosu, as the grandson of Hae Mosu's second son, King Go Jin, the ruler of Gori. This explains why Jumong was able to rise to the throne of Bukbuyeo.\n\nThe Founding\nThe Go Royal Family (Hangul: 고씨 왕족), The Han Royal Family (Hangul: 한씨왕족) was founded and descended from one common ancestor, who was Jumong, also the first ruler of Goguryeo. Jumong was the son of Go Mosu and Lady Yuhwa (Korean: 유화부인; Hanja: 柳花夫人). Lady Yuhwa was the daughter of Habaek (Korean: 하백; Hanja: 河伯), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (Korean: 해밝). Go Mosu was a descendant of Haemosu, the founder of Bukbuyeo, or North Buyeo, and was also said to have been a direct descendant or successor to the Emperors of Ancient Joseon (also known as Gojoseon). As a descendant of Haemosu, Jumong was driven by the goal of reuniting all of Gojoseon's ancient territory into one whole empire and one whole nation. With this goal in mind, he set off from Dongbuyeo and began building the foundations for his kingdom. After three years, he had already conquered several of the neighboring kingdoms and was ready to go into the final phase of constructing his kingdom. He completed this phase by holding hands with Jolbon and bringing it under his control. In 37 BC, Jumong finally established his kingdom and named it 'Goguryeo' (Hangul: 고구려). He also changed his last name from 'Hae' to 'Go,' which means 'high.' Goguryeo progressed and continued to grow stronger under Go Jumong's reign of 19 years. His first wife and their son, Yuri, soon to be Emperor King Yuri, fled from Dongbuyeo and came to Goguryeo during the last year of Jumong's reign. Jumong proclaimed Yuri his successor and Crown Prince (Hangul: 태자) before dying five months later.\n\nComplete Transition of the family name\nKing Yuri rose to the throne in 19 BC and ruled until his death in 18 AD. During his reign, the royal family had absolute power and all power was in the hands of the reigning emperor. Under Yuri, the kingdom was able to grow powerful enough to fight the Han Dynasty. After King Yuri, Daemusin, Mobon, and Minjung, the young prince Gung took the surname \"Go\" (Hanja: 高) for the first time in 3 generations. From King Taejo to King Bojang, the rulers of Goguryeo kept their ancestor's surname \"Go\" and \"Han\".\nAccording to the Samguk Sagi, the Goguryeo royal family claimed descent from the mythical god Gao Yang, who was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor of Chinese mythology, and thus took the surname of \"Go\" (高); however, this legend was discredited in the commentaries (논찬; 論贊) by Kim Busik, the compiler of the Samguk Sagi, who concluded that both Baekje and Goguryeo originated from Buyeo.\n\nHeight of Imperial power\nGoguryeo's height of power came in the reign of Taewang Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo, who created and strengthened Goguryeo's cavalry and naval units to pacify the south and the north. Gwanggaeto the Great attacked and conquered Buyeo, Biryu-guk, the Later Yan, Malgal, and the Ainu tribes. Goguryeo's height of power finally came, but the bringer of glory died at the young age of 39.\n\nDecline of Imperial power\nKing Munjamyeong continued to expand Goguryeo's territories after receiving the full surrender of the ancient Korean state of Buyeo in 494. After the reign of King Munjamyeong, his son Heung-An became King Anjang. King Anjang continued to attack the southern kingdoms and weaken their power, further establishing the empire's power over both the Korean peninsula and Manchuria. After King Anjang, his son became King Anwon.\n\nFall of Goguryeo\nGoguryeo's 27th ruler, King Yeongryu, submitted to the newly-risen Tang Dynasty, despite the overwhelming victories that Goguryeo had achieved over the Sui. King Yeongryu was assassinated by Yeon Gaesomun (연개소문), who was Dae Magniji (대막리지/Grand Prime Minister) of Goguryeo until 666 CE. King Bojang, the nephew of King Yeongryu, rose to the throne and ruled until 668 CE, when Goguryeo was destroyed.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Korea\nThree Kingdoms of Korea\nTaewang\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It was established in 1618, as an initiative of Johan Post and Herman Krefting on the orders of King Christian IV. A royal privilege granted in 1624 meant that the company almost had a monopoly on iron production on an industrial scale within Norway. The company operated ironworks at Bærum, Eidsvoll, Fossum and Hakadal. After Johan Post died in 1631,  Herman Krefting maintained an interest at the Eidsvoll and Bærums ironworks until his own death in 1651.\n\nSee also\nBærums Verk\nEidsvoll Verk\nPassage 2:\nDet norske Theater (Bergen)\nDet norske Theater is a former theatre in Bergen, Norway, and regarded as the first pure Norwegian stage theatre. It opened in 1850 (1850) by primus motor, violinist Ole Bull, and closed in 1863 (1863), after a bankruptcy. The theatre's first production was Holberg's comedy Den Vægelsindede, and the opening was on 2 January 1850. The theatre played at the old comedy house built in 1800.In 1876 the theatre Den Nationale Scene opened in the same building.\nPassage 3:\nSpråkåret 2013\nSpråkåret (The Language Year) in Norway was arranged with government support in 2013. That year was 200 years after Ivar Aasen was born. It was 100 years after Det Norske Teatret (The Norwegian Theatre) opened. Ivar Aasen's life work was the development of Nynorsk (New Norse), a language with grammar and vocabulary based upon the way ordinary Norwegians, primarily rural, spoke.  After a few hundred years under Danish rule, many in the cities as well as everyone educated in Denmark, spoke and wrote Danish and Danish was taught in schools. Det Norske Teatret is a theatre in Oslo that primarily produces plays in Nynorsk.\nThese two jubilees were the main reasons for the decision to create a national year of celebration of languages.  Språkåret 2013 was a stand-alone project, organised within the Nynorsk kultursentrum (Nynorsk culture center) and funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture.\n\nValuable cultural expressions\nThe purpose of Språkåret 2013 was to embrace and celebrate the diversity of language that exists in Norway. One sought to put focus on the positive effects that arise out of living in a country with several languages. The two official written versions of Norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk, the language of the indigenous people in the north, Sámi, and the three recognised national minority languages;  Kvensk, romani, romanes as well as Norwegian sign language, another official language.  In addition there is huge variation in local dialects as well as the many languages spoken by immigrants. The year of 2013 was dedicated to celebrating, discussing, and trying to raise awareness of the valuable cultural expressions and identities that are connected to languages and dialects.\n\nObjectives for the year\nTo create stronger linguistic self-esteem amongst people who have Nynorsk as their preferred language and moreover to heighten public acceptance of the country's language-divided culture.\nTo increase pride in the linguistic culture of Nynorsk, also among the people who have Bokmål as their preferred language.\nTo increase knowledge of and respect for the native language Sámi, minority languages, immigrant- languages and sign language.\nTo put the language situation in Norway into international and comparative perspectives.\nTo take an initiative to more contact among language-policy actors with common interests that cross linguistic borders and ethnicity.In an interview in December 2013, the leader of the language year project, the author Inger Johanne Sæterbakk, said that the language year had lived a life of its own; many arrangements occurred without central steering. No one knows how many there were, but it was more than a thousand. Sæterbakk said that she saw that the use of dialects have an emotional element, while written language is used more as a tool. While she regretted that it wasn't possible to engage minority language groups more, she was very pleased with the activity-level all around the country.\nPassage 4:\nLudvig Holberg\nLudvig Holberg, Baron of Holberg (3 December 1684 – 28 January 1754) was a writer, essayist, philosopher, historian and playwright born in Bergen, Norway, during the time of the Dano-Norwegian dual monarchy. He was influenced by Humanism, the Enlightenment and the Baroque. Holberg is considered the founder of modern Danish and Norwegian literature. He was also a prominent Neo-Latin author, known across Europe for his writing. He is best known for the comedies he wrote in 1722–1723 for the Lille Grønnegade Theatre in Copenhagen. Holberg's works about natural and common law were widely read by many Danish law students over two hundred years, from 1736 to 1936.\n\nStudies and teaching\nHolberg was the youngest of six brothers. His father, Christian Nielsen Holberg, died before Ludvig was one year old. He was educated in Copenhagen, and was a teacher at the University of Copenhagen for many years. At the same time, he started his successful career as an author, writing the first of a series of comedies.\nHe began to study theology at the University of Copenhagen and later taught himself law, history and language. He was not particularly interested in theology as a career, settling for an attestats (similar to a Bachelor's degree today), which gave him the right to work as a priest; he did not attempt a baccalaureus, magister or doctorate in the subject, nor did he follow a career as a theology professor, priest, or bishop. In Holberg's youth, it was common to study theology and specialize according to one's degree, for example in Greek, Latin, philosophy or history. For the purpose of becoming a lawyer, it was normal to study abroad. In 1736 the Danish Lawyer degree was established at the University of Copenhagen, a degree which continued to be granted for 200 years, and for which Holberg's writings remained common reading material throughout this time. Holberg was formally appointed assistant professor after having first worked as one without pay. He had to accept the first available position, which was teaching metaphysics. Later, he became a professor and taught rhetoric and Latin. Finally, he was given a professorship in the subject which he prized most and was most productive in, history.\nHolberg was well-educated and well-traveled. In his adolescence, he visited large cities in countries such as the Netherlands and France, and lived for a short period of time in Rome; and for a longer period of time in Oxford, England (and bring him before Margit.\nThe king’s men arrive.

Tubbs (January 23, 1935 – June 13, 2012) was an American football linebacker who played for ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL) from 1957 to 1966, mainly for the Dallas Cowboys.  He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft.  After his retirement he stayed with the Cowboys as an assistant coach for 22 years. He played college football at the University of Oklahoma. In 1996, he was inducted into thebriefly in only two games, and in his second game he suffered a season-ending knee injury. An option on his contract was not picked up in April 1989 and he retired, paving the way for Troy Aikman to take the reins of the struggling franchise.\nWhite had 1,761 completions on 2,950 attempts for 21,959 yards, 155 touchdowns, and 132 interceptions in his career.  He also gained  482 yards and scored 8 touchdowns rushing. Unusual for a quarterback, he had two pass receptions for touchdowns, both from a halfback option pass. On special teams he punted 610 times for 24,509 yards, an average of 40.4 yards per punt, with 144 punts inside the 20 and 77 touchbacks. His record as the Cowboys' starting quarterback was 62–32 (.659 winning percentage) during the regular season, and 5–5 in the playoffs.\nBeing Roger Staubach's successor and never reaching a Super Bowl as a starting quarterback contributed to White's being an unappreciated player, even considering all of the successes he achieved for the Cowboys and the NFL during the decade of the eighties. \"I don't think anybody could have followed Roger and done as well as Danny\", Coach Tom Landry remarked, \"Danny was a solid winner.\"\n\nNFL career statistics\nRegular season\nCoaching career\nWhite's career as a coach began shortly after his playing days ended.

He was named the head coach of the Arena Football League expansion Utah Blaze, which began play in 2006. He led his teams to the playoffs in 10 of 11 seasons, including two championships (1994 and 1997), finishing with a 162–95 record as a head coach.\nIn 2002, he was inducted into the Arena Football League Hall of Fame in recognition for his coaching success.\n\nHead coaching record\nPersonal life\nWhite's father, Wilford \"Whizzer\" White (no relation to college football legend and U.S. Supreme Court justice Byron White, who also was nicknamed \"Whizzer\" and played American football), was the first Arizona State University All-American football player and still ranks third in school history with 1502 rushing yards in a season (1950), he also played halfback for the Chicago Bears from 1951–52.In 1983, White briefly recorded as a country music artist for the Grand Prix label.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nToy Trawler Spaniel\nThe Toy Trawler Spaniel is an extinct breed of Spaniel which physically was similar to the King Charles Spaniel of the 16th century. It is considered to have descended from the original King Charles Spaniel, and the older variety of the Sussex Spaniel. It was employed as a sports dog first before becoming a toy and show dog. It was considered to be on the verge of extinction by 1920. A preserved specimen is kept in Tring at the Natural History Museum.\n\nHistory\nThe specific origin of the breed is unknown, but in 1919, it was thought to have been descended from the originally curly-coated King Charles Spaniel and the old-fashioned curly-coated Sussex Spaniel. Its original purpose may have been as a sporting dog, but it became more frequently used as a toy dog. By 1907, the breed was more popular in Europe than in the U.K., especially in the Netherlands and Italy.There is a preserved specimen at the Natural History Museum at Tring. Named Robin, it was bred by Lady Wentworth and was born in 1911. It died in 1920 when the breed was said to be \"nearly extinct\". Lady Wentworth wrote about using Toy Trawler Spaniels to re-breed the original King Charles Spaniel in her book Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians, published under the name of the \"Hon. Mrs. Neville Lytton\" in 1911.\n\nDescription\nThe Toy Trawler Spaniel was considered to be a throwback to the original King Charles Spaniel. The head was small and light, with an upwards tip on its short black nose. The top of the skull was flat and not dome-shaped, and had long ears set forward. Its coat was generally feathered quite long and was described as curly but not woolly, and its body was quite solidly built.Its height was variable, ranging from 11–13 inches (28–33 cm) at the withers, although examples were given at 9 inches (23 cm), with proportionate weight given for a 13 inches (33 cm) high dog weighing 15 pounds (6.8 kg).The preferred colour was black with a white waistcoat, then red with a white waistcoat, but they also came in black and white and red and white. They were described as being very sweet, but also very bold and courageous, with timidity considered to be a fault in the show ring.\nPassage 2:\nSussex Spaniel\nThe Sussex Spaniel is a breed of dog native to Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and is as old a breed as and similar in appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation.\nThe Sussex Spaniel was first recorded in 1795 in East and West Sussex, being at Goodwood and Rolvenden for specific hunting conditions. The breed nearly became extinct during the Second World War, but was bred back to sustainable numbers. It is now more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States than any other countries, and is recognised by all major kennel clubs. The breed was one of the first to be recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1872. Sussex Spaniel Stump won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club.\n\nDescription\nThe Sussex Spaniel is a low compact spaniel similar in appearance, but not in colour, to a  Clumber Spaniel. It is normally no taller than 15–16 in (38–41 cm) at the withers and the usual weight range is 45–50 lb (20–23 kg) with a roughly rectangular appearance. The Clumber Spaniel meanwhile is normally between 17–20 in (43–51 cm) high at the shoulder, and weighing 55–85 lb (25–39 kg).One of the noticeable features is their golden liver-coloured coat which is unique to the breed. Historically however, there have also been examples of black, black and tan and golden liver and white coloured Sussex Spaniels.  coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The long silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.\n\nTemperament\nThe Sussex Spaniel is a slow-paced, calm breed with somewhat clownish behaviour that normally keeps his energy and enthusiasm in check.  He is always eager to be around people, is excellent around children, and can be quite protective of the family. They make excellent candidates for therapy dog work.  Most Sussex Spaniels are primarily family pets, but they are competent enough to aid a hunter though quite stubborn to train. They tend to have a natural ability to quarter in the field, have excellent noses, and can be used to retrieve, given training. The breed is the only spaniel to howl once a game's scent is picked up.\n\nHealth\nThe breed is generally healthy with an average life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern but because of the breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.Another common condition is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which is common to a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.Whelping sometimes presents difficulties and require caesarean section for successful delivery of the puppies. The Sussex Spaniel is considered difficult to breed.\n\nHeart conditions in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, which is the most common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.Patent ductus arteriosus also appears in the breed. It is a condition where a small blood vesselwhich is for breeds with registrations from 300-450. Breeds on the \"At Watch\" list included in 2013 the English Setter, the Old English Sheepdog, the Irish Terrier, the Irish Wolfhound, the Welsh Springer Spaniel, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and the Welsh Terrier.\n\nListed breeds\nKey\nTable\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nTugou\nTugou (土狗, pinyin: tǔ gǒu), which literally translates as “Native Dog” in the Chinese language, is a diverse group of dogs indigenous to China and still abundant across the country today. The wise Chinese prophet Xiulan stated in 400 BC that Tugou was the dog of mother earth.  Tugou are traditionally used for guarding, hunting, and as meat dogs and are considered less valuable than pet dogs. As the name of the meaning suggests, it refers to any various types of breeds of primitive spitz-type dogs kept by other Non-Han ethnic groups of China, as well as the aboriginals of Taiwan. Several landraces as well as recognized breeds are considered tugou, including the Chinese Pastoral Dog (中华田园犬, pinyin: zhōng huá tián yuán quǎn), Chongqing Dog,  Chow Chow, Liangshan Hound, Shar Pei, Taiwan Dog, Tang Dog, and Xiasi Dog.\n\nHistory\nTugou are believed to have evolved from wolves, and have been domesticated by Han Chinese, following their migration and distributes widely across China.  Tugou have significantly higher genetic diversity compared to other populations, indicating that they may be a basal group relating to the divergence of dogs from gray wolves. See Domestication of the dog.\n\nAppearance\n\nWhile Tugou vary considerably in many ways, they generally share a set of uniform characters: medium build dogs with prick ears, almond shaped eyes, a sickle tail, hunting instinct, and were developed as a landrace.\nPassage 10:\nPicardy Spaniel\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.\n\nHistory\nThe French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d' Oysel described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus. Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty. The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-François Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons.The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.\n\nRecognition\nThe Epagneul Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937. A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont-Audemer Club to form the Club des Epagneuls Picards, Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer.The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, United Kennel Club, and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. All four associations use the standard as set by the FCI. It is also recognised by the Continental Kennel Club, but unlike the closely related Blue Picardy Spaniel, it is not recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club.\n\nDescription\nAppearance\nTypical examples of the breed measure between 22–24 inches (56–61 cm) at the withers, with the average weight between 20–25 kilograms (44–55 lb). The breed is similar in size to the English Setter, although is slightly smaller. Of the Spaniel type breeds, only the Large Münsterländer and Drentse Patrijshond are recognised as possibly growing to larger sizes, with the Drentse measuring 21.5–25.5 in (55–65 cm), and the Münsterländer slightly smaller with a narrower range at 23–25 in (58–64 cm).The breed has a squarely built muscular body and  an oval shaped head with a long muzzle and long ears that hang fairly low. Its coat can vary in colours from chocolate, chestnut brown and white with sandy coloured markings on the head and white or grey spots on the legs. Its hair is abundant with a slight wave, enabling it to work in dense cover and even in water.\n\nTemperament\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character with a laid-back attitude, and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for pheasants, and in swamps for snipes. However it can also be used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content with a small amount of space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.\n\nHealth\nThe Picardy Spaniel has no known hereditary health problems, and has an average lifespan of 14 years. However being a hunting spaniel, the breed is prone to ear infections. These infections are common among dogs with pendulous ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of spaniel. Overfeeding a Picardy Spaniel may lead to\noverweight.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nIn a Coma\nIn a Coma: 1995-2005 is the title of the Matthew Good compilation album, featuring both his solo work and work from the Matthew Good Band.\n\nDetails\nThe album is often titled In a Coma: 1995-2005, and notably lacks either \"best of\" or \"greatest hits\" in the official title. It was released on September 20, 2005. However, even before its release, the album reached #1 on Amazon.ca via pre-orders, and 200 signed copies sold out from Matthew Good's official site in under four hours.\nThe album is available in two forms: the regular version and the deluxe. The regular only includes disc one, the deluxe features two audio discs and one DVD. The first disc contains nearly all of the singles released by the Matthew Good Band and Matt solo, lacking only Good's most recent singles (\"Near Fantastica\", \"It's Been a While Since I Was Your Man\", \"In Love with a Bad Idea\") and the singles from the album The Audio of Being (\"Carmelina\", \"Anti-Pop\"). The first disc also contains two new songs (\"Oh Be Joyful\", \"Big City Life\"), as well as a b-side (\"Pony Boy\") recorded during the sessions for The Audio of Being.\nFor the second disc, Good entered the studio solo with an acoustic guitar and recorded new versions of several songs from his extensive catalog. For added effect, Good miked the street outside the studio as he performed, adding an ambiance to the session that Good particularly enjoyed. Given the scarcity of the two MGB EPs Lo-Fi B-Sides and Loser Anthems, Good decided to add the two discs to the latter half of the second disc as a nod to fans.\nThe DVD in the deluxe package includes every promotional video filmed during Good's career, solo and with the Matthew Good Band. As a bonus, Good recorded a commentary track with Bill Morrison, who directed the majority of the videos. The DVD also includes an animated video for \"While We Were Hunting Rabbits\", which was created by students at Sheridan College. After Good realized that his favourite songs had not been included in the package, a section featuring those songs accompanied by a slideshow of images similar to the cover artwork was added to the disc.\n\"Oh Be Joyful\", the first single from In a Coma, was released on July 25, 2005. The song's release was accompanied by a video that many fans found confusing, as it contained little more than a burning fireplace. Matthew Good was quick to defend his video on his blog, saying that it was \"one of the greatest temporary musical screen savers of all time\" and that it was only intended to appear on his site, not to play on Much Music.\n\nTrack listing\nRegular release\n\"Oh Be Joyful\"  – 3:52 (previously unreleased)\n\"Big City Life\"  – 4:15 (previously unreleased)\n\"Alert Status Red\"  – 4:19 (from White Light Rock & Roll Review)\n\"Weapon\"  – 6:06 (from Avalanche)\n\"In a World Called Catastrophe\"  – 5:59 (from Avalanche)\n\"Hello Time Bomb\"  – 3:56 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n\"Load Me Up\"  – 3:42 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n\"Strange Days\"  – 4:24 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n\"The Future Is X-Rated\"  – 3:46 (from Beautiful Midnight)\n\"Everything Is Automatic\"  – 4:18 (from Underdogs)\n\"Rico\"  – 3:27 (from Underdogs)\n\"Apparitions\"  – 5:14 (from Underdogs)\n\"Indestructible\"  – 3:26 (from Underdogs)\n\"Symbolistic White Walls\"  – 4:30 (from Last of the Ghetto Astronauts)\n\"Haven't Slept In Years (Alternate)\"  – 3:35 (from Raygun)\n\"Alabama Motel Room\"  – 3:20 (from Last of the Ghetto Astronauts)\n\"Pony Boy\"  – 4:03 (previously unreleased)\n\"All Together\" - 4:37 (previously unreleased) iTunes Pre-Order Track / ca.7digital.com exclusive\n\nDeluxe Edition\nPart One: Rooms (acoustic reworkings)\n\n\"Truffle Pigs\"  – 4:04\n\"Tripoli\"  – 4:51\n\"Generation X-Wing\"  – 3:55\n\"Apparitions\"  – 4:05\n\"North American for Life\"  – 3:13\n\"Advertising on Police Cars\"  – 4:08\n\"Hello Time Bomb\"  – 4:10\n\"Strange Days\"  – 4:55\n\"Prime Time Deliverance\"  – 4:22Part Two: Loser Anthems\n\n \"Flashdance II\"  – 4:44\n\"The Man from Harold Wood\"  – 2:18\n\"My Life as a Circus Clown\"  – 2:46\n\"Intermezzo: M.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, he had long been active in the B.C. music scene, and played bass guitar and/or written songs for Art Bergmann, DSK, ShoCore, Chrome Dog, Bif Naked, The Real McKenzies, and others. Priske was best known for playing bass guitar in the Canadian band Matthew Good Band from 1998 to 2002. After the band's dissolution in 2002, he kept playing with Matthew Good until the end of the In a Coma tour in fall 2005. Later in life, he lived in Kelowna and played in the Jon Bos Band and Florida Man.\n\nWriting\nPriske was an avid writer, contributing to weblogs as a \"citizen journalist\" for kitsilano.ca, and others. He contributed many technical and instructional articles to magazines such as CM (Canadian Musician). Priske also wrote for Wine Trails, and other wine-industry publications. He had a long history with the web, and was an early adopter of what is now known as \"web logging\" or \"blogging\", beginning with his popular \"Notes From The Road\" feature on the now defunct Matthew Good Band website, circa 2001. He kept a blog on Blogger, but updated it rarely.\n\nFilm work\nPriske was also involved in BC's thriving film and theatre industry, on stage and both in front of and behind the camera. As well as appearing in many music videos, he had bit parts in films like Red Scorpion 2, and Hard Core Logo, and appeared on stage in productions of Cabaret and You Can't Take It with You. Behind the scenes, Priske was active in the Art Department, earning an Emmy nomination for 2008's \"Tinman\".\n\nDeath\nOn July 11, 2020, Priske died of a heart attack.\n\nDiscography\nwith Matthew Good Band:\n\nBeautiful Midnight\nLoser Anthems\nThe Audio of Beingwith Matthew Good:\n\nAvalanche\nWhite Light Rock & Roll Review\nIn a Comawith DSK:\n\nExploder\nImploderwith Bif Naked:\n\nBif Naked\nEssentially Naked (greatest hits compilation)with The Real McKenzies:\n\nReal McKenzies\nClash of the Tartanswith ShoCore:\n\nuntitled release (2007)with Brooke Nolan:\n\nself-titled EPwith The Town Pants:\n\nWeight of WordsSex With Nixon (1995) Self titled LP\nPassage 7:\nWeapon (song)\n\"Weapon\" is a song by Canadian alternative rock artist Matthew Good. It was the first song released by Good as a solo artist after the break-up of the Matthew Good Band. The song was released in October 2002 as the lead single from his debut solo album, Avalanche.  The song peaked at No. 4 on Canada's Nielsen rock chart.\n\nTrack listing\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Weapon\" was directed by Matthew Good and Ante Kovac. It was filmed on October 5, 2002, at Pier 94. In a later commentary, Good related that Kovac's first edit of the video was far too standard, with gratuitous and generic fades. After firing Kovac, Good flew to Toronto and worked with video editor Jay Deschamps to re-craft the footage. While working on the edit, Good began to experiment with overlaying text and adding still frames and stock photos to help deliver the message. Good noted that the video was his favourite from his catalogue.\nThe video won the award for \"Best Video\" at the 2003 Juno Awards. Good did not attend the ceremony and Kovac accepted the award alone.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe song is featured on MuchMusic's compilation album Big Shiny Tunes 7.\nAn excerpt of the song was used as the opening credits theme music for CTV's series The Eleventh Hour.\nThe song was featured on Hockey Night in Canada in the opening montage for Game 5 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\"Weapon\" was also featured in the second-season finale of Smallville.\nThe song is used in the second-season episode \"A Higher Echelon\" of the J. J. Abrams series Alias.\nThe song appears in the third season of Queer As Folk.\nThe song was featured in the first season of Flashpoint in the episode \"Between Heartbeats\".\nPassage 8:\nIan Browne (musician)\nIan Browne (born November 12, 1973) is a Canadian-born musician and composer. He was formerly with psych-blues band No Sinner, and before that notably the drummer of the popular Canadian rock group Matthew Good Band. Browne plays drums and performs backup vocals on The Prettys' upcoming second LP \"Soirée\". He also played on No Sinner's debut EP Boo Hoo Hoo, and played drums and produced tracks on their 2016 LP \"Old Habits Die Hard\". He can also be heard on the Matthew Good Band albums Last of the Ghetto Astronauts, Raygun, Underdogs, Lo-Fi B-Sides, Beautiful Midnight, Loser Anthems, Audio of Being, and the greatest hits compilation In a Coma.\nWhile with Matthew Good Band, Browne received Juno Awards in 2000 for Best Group of 1999 and Best Rock Album  of 1999. Browne also composed original music for the Sci-Fi network series Sanctuary. He now records and performs with The Prettys and occasionally other Vancouver, British Columbia based artists Rich Hope and Dustin Bentall.\nAs a composer, his work can be heard on the science fiction series Flash Gordon and Sanctuary. And Now and forever he’s playing in The Pierce Kingans , recording/playing on over 13 EPs.\nPassage 9:\nYes to Everything\nYes to Everything is a 2005 album by Canadian alternative rock band 54-40. This was the first 54-40 album recorded with the band's new guitarist, Dave Genn (former guitarist of Matthew Good Band).

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPortland International Airport MAX Station\nPortland International Airport, or just Airport on station signage, is a light rail station in Portland, Oregon, United States, served by TriMet as part of the MAX Light Rail system. It serves Portland International Airport as the eastern terminus of the Red Line, which connects travelers to downtown Portland and Beaverton. The station is attached to ground floor of the main passenger terminal, near the southern end of the arrivals hall and baggage claim area. It features a wedge-shaped island platform, just beyond which both tracks join because the section approaching the terminal is single-tracked.\nPortland International Airport station was built as part of the Airport MAX project; construction began in July 2000, and it opened on September 10, 2001. Trains serve it for 22 hours daily with headways of 15 minutes during most of the day. In late 2018, the station recorded an average of 2,461 weekday boardings.\n\nHistory\nPortland's regional transit agency, TriMet, had served Portland International Airport with bus routes since 1970, notably with route 12–Sandy Boulevard since 1986, the same year planners from Metro (the Portland metropolitan area's regional government) first proposed an airport light rail line. Early plans envisioned a line running from Clackamas to the airport via Interstate 205 (I-205) using rights-of-way provided by the I-205 busway, which was originally built to accommodate a bus rapid transit line that never operated. In 1991, the Port of Portland adopted a multi-phased, $300 million airport master plan to address expected passenger traffic growth through 2010; the plan raised the capacity of the main passenger terminal building, as well as provisioned for a future light rail station outside the terminal's arrivals hall. By 1994, travelers using the airport had risen by 34 percent, far exceeding the Port's projections. Port officials, struggling to meet the surge in demand, moved to accelerate airport light rail plans, which regional planners did not anticipate until the late 2000s. TriMet—which by then was operating the region's light rail system called Metropolitan Area Express (MAX)—also aimed to complete its Westside MAX and the South/North Corridor projects before it would consider extending MAX to the airport.In 1996, engineering firm Bechtel approached the Port with an unsolicited proposal to build the airport line. After negotiations between Bechtel, the Port, and local jurisdictions, Bechtel was granted the design–build contract for the light rail extension in exchange for development rights to the 120-acre (48.6 ha) Portland International Center, the largest commercially zoned property in Portland at the time. Bechtel later developed this property and renamed it Cascade Station. The Port projected the airport terminal station to cost $8.4 million and allocated a $3 ticket fee to fund its construction. Delta Airlines, Reno Air, and United Airlines protested the use of ticket fees but the Federal Aviation Administration authorized it in May 1999. Construction of the Airport MAX extension commenced the following month. Hoffman Construction began building the station's platform in July 2000 and by August, Stacy and Witbeck had started to lay the 3,000 ft (914.4 m) of rail along the segment closest to the terminal.On September 10, 2001, the station opened along with the entire Airport MAX extension that introduced Red Line service between downtown Portland and the airport. Celebrations planned for the following weekend were canceled following the September 11 attacks, and the airport was closed for three days. Planners projected single-car trains to initially serve Portland International Airport station but TriMet deployed two-car consists on the line after recording 3,800 riders over Thanksgiving weekend in November 2001. In September 2003, TriMet extended Red Line service farther west using the existing Westside MAX tracks to Beaverton Transit Center. This was done in an effort to provide a one-seat ride to the airport for westside riders. In 2006, the station handled more than one million passengers in a single year for the first time.TriMet had reintroduced bus service to the airport with the 272–PDX Night Bus route on September 2, 2018. The bus route ran in the late night and early morning hours when the Red Line was not operating. It was indefinitely suspended on April 5, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStation details\nThe station's platform is situated at ground level just outside the main passenger terminal, near the southernmost entrance and within 150 ft (45.7 m) of the baggage claim area. It features a wedge-shaped island platform and a glass canopy designed by ZGF Architects, which also designed the airport terminal's main-entrance canopy. An 80-seat station lobby is located inside the terminal and has ticket vending machines and real-time displays showing train departure times. The station occupies the end of a single-track section of the Airport MAX segment; the only other such section on the MAX system is located on another segment of the Airport MAX near Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center.\n\nPublic art\nPublic art pieces commissioned for the Airport MAX Project have a common theme of \"flight\". The station houses one art installation as part of TriMet's Public Art Program, which is funded at 1.5 percent of a project's total cost. Time Flies by Christine Bourdette is a large, porcelain enamel mural that is displayed on a wall between the station platform and the baggage claim area. The work is described as \"a sequence of images related to time and motion\".  Bourdette also installed bronze rails that lead passengers from the escalators to the platform and blue chevrons on the platform pavement to depict movement.\n\nServices\nPortland International Airport station is served by TriMet's MAX Red Line, which connects the airport to Northeast Portland, Portland City Center, and central Beaverton. In late 2018, the station recorded an average of 2,461 boardings on weekdays. The day's first train arrives from Beaverton Transit Center. The last three westbound trips travel eastbound to Ruby Junction/East 197th Avenue station as through services of the Blue Line. Headway between trains varies from 15 minutes for most of the day to 30 minutes during the early mornings and late evenings. Services operate on all days of the week and are the most frequent on weekdays. Trains from the station take approximately 40 minutes to reach Pioneer Square in downtown Portland—where transfers to all lines are available—and approximately 65 minutes to reach the other end of the line at Beaverton Transit Center.\nPassage 2:\nGerald R. Ford International Airport\nGrand Rapids Gerald R. Ford International Airport (IATA: GRR, ICAO: KGRR, FAA LID: GRR) is a commercial airport in Cascade Township approximately 13 milesAir with the Saab 340B.\n\nDestinations\nUsing Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport as an operating base, PenAir operated scheduled service to the following destinations in Alaska as of June 2019.\nAnchorage (ANC) – Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (to Cold Bay, Dillingham, Dutch Harbor, King Salmon, Kodiak, Fairbanks, and Sand Point)\nCold Bay (CDB) – Cold Bay Airport (to Anchorage)\nDillingham (DLG) – Dillingham Airport (to Anchorage)\nDutch Harbor / Unalaska (DUT) – Unalaska Airport (to Anchorage) (marketed and sold by Alaska Airlines)\nKing Salmon (AKN) – King Salmon Airport (to Anchorage)\nKodiak (ADQ) – Kodiak Airport (to Anchorage)\nFairbanks (FAI) – Fairbanks International Airport (to Anchorage)\nSand Point (SDP) – Sand Point Airport (to Anchorage)All flights in the state of Alaska were operated as code sharing service with Ravn Alaska, with the exception of service to Dutch Harbor / Unalaska which was operated under a capacity purchase agreement, where flights were marketed and sold by Alaska Airlines and operated by PenAir.\n\nCommunity awareness\nPenAir, along with Bering Air, Frontier Flying Service, Grant Aviation, Northern Air Cargo, and Ryan Air Services all participate in the Flying Can service, which allows rural Alaskan communities to recycle aluminum cans and number 1 PET bottles in cooperation with Alaskans for Litter Prevention and Recycling.\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn October 10, 2001, Peninsula Airways (PenAir) Flight 350, a Cessna 208 Caravan (N9530F) on a scheduled flight from Dillingham, Alaska to King Salmon, Alaska, crashed shortly after takeoff from Dillingham Airport. The pilot and all nine passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed on impact. There was no fire.\nOn October 17, 2019, PenAir Flight 3296, a Saab 2000 (N686PA) on a scheduled flight from Anchorage, Alaska to Unalaska, Alaska, went off the runway after landing at the Unalaska Airport, teetering over a bank toward a nearby body of water. The left propeller was destroyed and at least part of one blade entered the passenger cabin. An eyewitness reported high winds at the time of the accident. There were 39 passengers, including a high school swim team from Cordova, Alaska, and 3 flight crew aboard the flight. One passenger was fatally injured, two passengers were critically injured, and 10 more received medical care at a local hospital. There was no fire.\n\nSee also\nList of seaplane operators\nPassage 7:\nPan Am Flight 845/26\nPan Am Flight 845/26 was a four-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruiser named Clipper United States and registered as N1032V. It departed Portland International Airport in Oregon on a flight to Honolulu International Airport in Hawaii on March 26, 1955. The aircraft was en route and about 35 miles (56 km) off the Oregon coast when at 11:12 Pacific Standard Time the No. 3 engine and propeller tore loose from the wing causing a loss of control. The aircraft was ditched. \nThe aircraft floated for twenty minutes before sinking in 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) of water. Approximately two hours after the aircraft ditched, the United States Navy attack transport USS Bayfield (APA-33) arrived on the scene and rescued the 19 survivors. Four people died.The probable cause was failure of No. 3 propeller which caused the engine to detach and the aircraft to become uncontrollable.\nThe experience provided lessons that helped prevent any casualties in another ditching the following year, when Pan Am Flight 6 sank between Honolulu and San Francisco.\nPassage 8:\nPre-Commissioning Unit\nPre-commissioning unit (PRECOMUNIT or PCU) is a designation used by the United States Navy to describe vessels under construction prior to their official commissioning. For example, prior to her commissioning, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) had been described by the Navy as \" PCU Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78)\". Such descriptions can appear in the media as well.\n\"PCU\" is a temporary, descriptive term, and is not a ship prefix or a part of the ship's official name. Until they are commissioned, U.S. Navy vessels are officially identified by their given name and hull number, such as Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78).A \"PCU\" is also the entity that the ships staff is assigned to for training while the ship is being constructed and fitted-out. Prior to reporting to the ship, sailors will report to a PCU at one of two fleet training centers, located at either Naval Station Norfolk or Naval Base San Diego.\n\nSee also\nList of current United States Navy ships\nPassage 9:\nTwin Cities Air Service\nTwin Cities Air Service was an American fixed-base operator and charter airline based at Auburn, Maine and operated from Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport and the Portland International Jetport. The airline was a certified Part 135 operator, provided on demand and commuter service, while the FBO provided standard aircraft services and maintenance, specializing in overhauls of the Cessna 400 series aircraft.  Beginning in March 2010, Twin Cities Air Service began a scheduled commuter route between Portland, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.  At the time of the initiation of this route, Twin Cities was the only scheduled carrier into the Yarmouth Airport, and was the only scheduled international service into the Portland International Jetport.\n\nHistory\nTwin Cities Air Service was founded in 1992 as a fixed-base operator at the Auburn airport.  The company has since expanded to include on demand air charter services, airframe maintenance and support, and scheduled international air service.\nCh-aviation stated \"Out of Business\", the last change on the Website was 2012, it seems the company has ceased.\n\nFleet\nTwin Cities Air Service currently operated a fleet of five aircraft. The majority of these aircraft are available for on-demand charter operations throughout the Northeastern United States, although the aircraft are certified to operate in Canada, Bermuda, and parts of The Caribbean and Central America.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBad Teacher\nBad Teacher is a 2011 American comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan from a screenplay by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. Starring Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, John Michael Higgins and Jason Segel, the film tells the story of a lazy  middle school teacher who hates her job, her students, and her co-workers but returns to teaching after her wealthy fiancé dumps her. Bad Teacher was released in the United States on June 24, 2011, by Columbia Pictures. It grossed $216.2 million.\n\nPlot\nElizabeth Halsey is a lazy, immoral, manipulative, gold-digging teacher at John Adams Middle School in Chicago who curses at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana and lets her kids watch movies so she can sleep through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fiancé, but he dumps her when his mother shows him that Elizabeth is only after his money, so she resumes her job. She tries to win over wealthy substitute teacher Scott Delacorte. Her dedicated and enthusiastic colleague Amy Squirrel also pursues him while Elizabeth rejects advances from the school's gym teacher, Russell Gettis.\nElizabeth plans to have her breasts enlarged and becomes more motivated to do so upon learning Scott's ex-girlfriend had large breasts. However, she cannot afford the $9,300 procedure. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery through the 7th-grade car wash, wearing provocative clothing and manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy informs the principal about Elizabeth's embezzlement, but he dismisses her claims when no evidence is provided. Scott also admits that he is attracted to Amy and only likes Elizabeth as a friend.\nDiscovering that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to intensely study To Kill a Mockingbird for the test. However, since it is late in the school year, combined with her unorthodox teaching methods, the students score low on the book quizzes, further frustrating her. Meanwhile, she befriends Russell, as Amy and Scott start dating.\nElizabeth plans to steal the state test answers by impersonating a journalist and seducing Carl Halabi, a state professor in charge of creating and distributing the exams. She convinces Carl to go into his office to have sex, but drugs him and steals the answer key. A month later Elizabeth wins the bonus, completing her needed funds, and books her breast enlargement.\nWhen Elizabeth learns that Amy and Scott are chaperoning an upcoming field trip, she smears an apple with poison ivy and leaves it for Amy, who ends up with blisters covering her face and cannot go. On the trip, Elizabeth seduces Scott. They dry hump and Elizabeth secretly leaves Amy a message through Scott's phone, recording all the action. However, Scott's ever-changing ideals disappoint Elizabeth. After her student Garrett is taunted by his classmates for confessing to an unrequited attraction to a superficial girl in the class named Chase, Elizabeth consoles him and helps make him popular, which prompts her to begin reflecting on her own superficial ways.\nBack at the school, Amy switches Elizabeth's desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeth's sealed drawer. The evidence Amy finds leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having been informed that her desk was switched, Elizabeth states that teachers in the school use drugs. When the police bring a sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeth's mini liquor bottles, marijuana and OxyContin pills in Amy's classroom, in Elizabeth's desk, leading to Amy getting arrested and transferred to another school by the superintendent. Scott asks Elizabeth to start over, but she rejects him in favor of Russell, having learned they have a lot in common.\nWhen the new school year starts, Elizabeth has reformed. She is kinder to her co-workers, and has started a relationship with Russell, and did not get her breasts enlarged because she feels that it is unnecessary. Elizabeth also has a new position as the new guidance counselor.\n\nCast\nProduction\nBad Teacher is directed by Jake Kasdan based on a screenplay by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. Columbia Pictures purchased Eisenberg and Stupnitsky's spec script in August 2008. In May 2009, Kasdan was hired to direct Bad Teacher. The following December, Cameron Diaz was cast in the film's lead role. Justin Timberlake was cast opposite Diaz in March 2010, and filming began later in the month.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nThe film grossed $100.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, while its worldwide total stands at $216.2 million.The film was released in North America on June 20, 2011, in 3,049 theaters. It took in $12,243,987—$4,016 per theater—in its opening day, and grossed a total of $31,603,106 in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office, behind Cars 2. In Germany, the film reached No. 1 on the country's Cinema Charts in its opening week after 496,000 people saw the film. This caused Kung Fu Panda 2, which reached No. 1 the week before, to fall to No. 2.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 192 reviews and a rating average of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"In spite of a promising concept and a charmingly brazen performance from Cameron Diaz, Bad Teacher is never as funny as it should be.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 47 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nAccolades\nHome media\nBad Teacher was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and a combo pack on October 18, 2011.\n\nPossible sequel and TV series\nOn June 20, 2013, Sony announced that it was working on Bad Teacher 2. The company hired Justin Malen to write the sequel. Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, who wrote the first film, will return as producers. A release from Sony studios said the project is \"being developed for Cameron Diaz to star in the film, but no deal is yet set with the actress.\" Jake Kasdan will again be the director.On May 23, 2013, CBS announced a TV series based on the movie, with CBS Studios's consensus states: \"A parody that pokes fun at rock stars and reductive biopics alike, this comedy sings in large part because of stellar performances and clever original music.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics.Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: \"Instead of sending everything over the top at high energy, like Top Secret! or Airplane!, they allow Reilly to more or less actually play the character, so that, against all expectations, some scenes actually approach real sentiment.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine wrote: \"The tricky thing about parody movies is that the jokes get old fast and they're hit-and-miss. Walk Hard, a spoof of every musical biopic from Ray to Walk the Line, is guilty on both counts. How lucky that when the jokes do hit, they kick major ass.\" A 2022 review of the best comedy films of the 21st century placed this at sixth.The film was not commercially successful, taking $18 million at the US box office which was less than the film's $35 million budget.John C. Reilly received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Musical or Comedy and a nomination for Best Original Song.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 8, 2008.

Charlie Wadhams and Benji Hughes wrote the song \"Let's Duet\". Marshall Crenshaw wrote the title song, and Van Dyke Parks penned the Brian Wilson-esque 1960s-styled psychedelic jam \"Black Sheep\" (the recording session seems to be a specific parody of Wilson's Smile album sessions, on which Van Dyke Parks worked). Antonio Ortiz wrote \"Take My Hand\". A number of critics noted the unusually high quality of many of the individual songs on the soundtrack, how well they reflected the styles and times they were attempting to parody, and how well they stood on their own as quality compositions. The soundtrack was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award and was nominated and won the Sierra Award for Best Song in a Motion Picture from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society. John C. Reilly sang on all the tracks and played guitar on most of them.\nPassage 9:\nWeird Loners\nWeird Loners is an American sitcom that was created by Michael J. Weithorn.

The website’s consensus reads: \" Weird Loners strands its veteran stars in an overly familiar sitcom structure burdened with a preponderance of humdrum humor.\"Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times gave the series a positive review, stating: \"[Weird Loners is] not loud or frenetic. It’s not particularly cutting-edge. It’s just funny, in a relaxed way that’s welcome somehow in a television spectrum full of pushiness and intensity.\"Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club wrote a positive review giving the series a \"B+\" grade. She observed that \"What Weird Loners has in its corner is an appealing cast and some hard-hitting TV vets\" and remarked that \"Since [Jake] Kasdan and [Michael J.] Weithorn both know their way around a sitcom set, it’s not a surprise that Weird Loners soon adds more gravity than most new shows boast from right out of the gate.\"\n\nEpisodes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nPit River Bridge\nThe Pit River Bridge (officially the Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial Bridge) is a double deck, deck truss, road and rail bridge over Shasta Lake in Shasta County, California. The bridge, carrying Interstate 5 on its upper deck and Union Pacific Railroad on its lower deck, was built in 1942 as part of the construction of the Shasta Dam/Shasta Lake reservoir system. The Pit River Bridge was constructed to replace the Lower Pit River Bridge, as the rising waters of the Shasta Lake reservoir would have put the older bridge underwater. The entire bridge spans 3,588 feet (1,094 m) long on the upper deck and 2,754 feet (839 m) on the lower deck. With a height of 500 feet (150 m) above the old Pit River bed, it is structurally the highest double decked bridge in the United States; however, today the bridge sits only about 40 feet (12 m) above the water when Shasta Lake is full. The bridge is Interstate 5's halfway point. \nAt the time it was built, the highway on the bridge was signed as U.S. Route 99 and the rail line was owned by Southern Pacific. The Coast Starlight, the passenger train line operated by Amtrak that runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, also uses the bridge.The bridge is officially known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial Bridge, to honor military veterans from California who have fought in foreign wars.The Pit River Bridge was the subject of the 1954 Pulitzer Prize for Photography winner entitled \"Rescue on Pit River Bridge\", taken by Virginia Schau.\n\nSee also\n Transport portal\n Engineering portal\n California portal\nPassage 2:\nAtherton Bridge\nThe Atherton Bridge is a historic iron truss bridge in Lancaster, Massachusetts, spanning the South Branch of the Nashua River. It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J. H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nThe bridge formerly carried Bolton Road, but was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and bypassed by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s.\nThe bridge remained open to pedestrian traffic until April 2020, when a flash flood damaged the bridge's wooden deck and it was closed to all traffic. The long-term future of the bridge is uncertain.The sign commemorating Atherton Bridge states:\n\n ATHERTON BRIDGE\nThere has been a bridge at this location since early settlement. It is named for \nJames Atherton, one of the signers of the petition for incorporation of the town in 1652. The 1794 map lists the bridge as 90 feet long on a county way Lancaster’s first iron bridge was placed here in 1870.\n\nTechnical information\nThe Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented Phoenix columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.\nThe bridge is 72 feet (22 m) long and 18.5 feet (5.6 m) feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments.\nThe bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project. At that time, it was one of only two known examples of the Post type of truss still surviving.\n\nSee also\nPonakin Bridge\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\nList of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Massachusetts\nList of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts\nPassage 3:\nWalnut Street Bridge (Chattanooga)\nBuilt in 1890, the 2,376-foot-long (724 m) Walnut Street Bridge connects Chattanooga, Tennessee's downtown with North Chattanooga. The bridge's main spans are pin-connected Pennsylvania through truss spans. The top chord of these truss spans are configured in five sections, making the spans similar to the Camelback truss design. The bridge is historically significant as an extremely long and old example of its type; according to the Historic American Engineering Record: \"The bridge was apparently the first non-military highway bridge across the Tennessee River.\"\n\nHistory\nAccording to a plaque on the bridge, Edwin Thacher was the chief engineer for the bridge. The bridge's superstructure was assembled by the Smith Bridge Company of Toledo, Ohio, which was a prolific late 19th-century bridge builder. The bridge's substructure was constructed by Neeley, Smith, and Company of Chattanooga. Most of the parts for the bridge were manufactured by Manly Jail Works of Dalton, Georgia and then shipped to the site by rail. \nA former Union officer from Ann Arbor, Michigan, William Andrew Slayton (1854–1935) was the stone contractor. Slayton lived in a stone house at 533 Barton Avenue, the house known for years by later inhabitants as the location of the \"Little Art Shop\". It is not known if he built this house, but similarly to Washington Roebling and the Brooklyn Bridge, he could overlook the project from his window. Many of the low stone walls in North Chattanooga are made up of the remnants of stones deemed too small for use in the piers. Subdivision plats in Chattanooga suggest that Slayton developed some areas to facilitate the hauling of materials from quarries in northeastern Alabama, and Slayton Street and Slayton Avenue are found near the current public library location on Broad Street.\nThe \"county bridge\", as the Walnut Street Bridge was once known, connected the predominantly white city on the south side of the Tennessee River with the large black work force on the north side (\"North Shore\") in Hill City, a town that was annexed by Chattanooga in 1912.\nThe bridge also carried trolleys of the Chattanooga Traction Company to Signal Mountain.Two black men were lynched on the bridge: Alfred Blount on February 14, 1893, was hanged from the first span for allegedly attacking a white woman; Ed Johnson on March 19, 1906, was hanged from the second span, also for allegedly attacking a white woman. Johnson's lynching initiated a court case (United States v. Shipp) before the Supreme Court that is notable for being the only criminal trial in its history.\n\nReconstruction\nThe bridge was closed to motor vehicles in 1978 and sat in disuse and disrepair for nearly a decade. Repairs0, 2012, during construction of the replacement bridge, an overhead gantry crane collapsed, causing a 90-tonne concrete box-girder segment to drop into the water below. While no one was injured, the accident delayed subsequent construction. WorkSafeBC inspectors evaluated the safety practices on the construction site.\nOn December 19, 2012, cold weather caused ice to accumulate on the supporting cables, periodically dropping to the car deck below, dubbed \"ice bombs\". ICBC, the vehicle insurance entity in British Columbia, reported 60 separate claims of ice damage during the incident. In addition, one driver required an ambulance due to injuries. The RCMP closed the bridge between 1:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. while engineers investigated. The Government installed collars on the cables that are manually released when conditions for ice accumulation are expected. They are installed on the tops of the cables on the towers and are released, falling down the cables by gravity to remove any snow build up.During December 2016, \"slush bombs\" affected the bridge again though the BC Government stated that these weren't as severe as the 2012 \"ice bombs.\" During December, the bridge was closed due to the threat of falling snow off of the cables and possible icy conditions.\n\nTolling (2012–2017)\nIn order to recover construction and operating costs, the bridge was electronically tolled when originally built. The toll rates increased to $1.60 for motorcycle, $3.15 for cars, $6.30 for small trucks and $9.45 for large trucks on August 15, 2015.  Through increased prices and greater traffic, Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp), the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge, forecast its revenue would grow by 85% between fiscal years 2014 and 2017. These fees were assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) decals or licence plate photos. A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt. Out-of-province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US-based contractor. A licence plate processing fee of $2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage. Monthly passes, which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge, were available for purchase. Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls. Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee. Tolls were expected to be removed by the year of 2050 or after collecting $3.3 billion. As announced by B.C. Premier John Horgan in August 2017, all tolls on the Port Mann Bridge were removed on September 1, 2017.  Debt service was transferred to the province of British Columbia at a cost of $135 million per year.\n\nTraffic volumes\nMonthly mean weekday traffic\nAs of January 2019\n\nTotal monthly traffic (in millions)\nAs of January 2019\n\nSee also\n\nList of crossings of the Fraser River\nList of bridges in Canada\nTallest structures in Canada\nPassage 9:\nColumbia River Bridge (Bridgeport, Washington)\nThe Columbia River Bridge, also known as the Bridgeport Bridge, at Bridgeport, Washington, was built to span the Columbia River in 1950. Composed of three spans, the bridge is a steel continuous riveted deck truss carrying Washington State Route 17 on a 26-foot-wide (7.9 m) roadway and two 3-foot (0.91 m) sidewalks. The center portion of the bridge spans 300 feet (91 m), flanked by 250-foot (76 m) end spans. The 70-foot (21 m) north approach span and the 100-foot (30 m) south approach span are supported by steel plate girders. The bridge played a significant role in the construction of the Chief Joseph Dam just upstream, as no bridge crossing had previously existed in the area. Construction on the dam started in 1945 and was completed, apart from the powerplant, in 1955. The bridge was designed and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Chief Joseph Dam project, and is significant for its association with the project and as a major crossing of the Columbia.The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 31, 1995.\n\nSee also\nList of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Washington (state)\nPassage 10:\nMaiden Lane Bridge\nThe Maiden Lane Bridge was a railroad bridge across the Hudson River between the city of Albany and Rensselaer County, New York. It was designed by Kellogg, Clark & Co., and was one of the largest bridges they designed. The bridge was owned and built by the Hudson River Bridge Company, which was owned jointly by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company which owned 3/4, and the Boston and Albany Railroad Company which owned 1/4. The Maiden Lane Bridge was often referred to as the \"South Bridge\", while the Livingston Avenue Bridge was referred to as the \"North Bridge\". The Livingston Ave. Bridge was used for freight (and through-traffic passenger trains) while passenger trains used the Maiden Lane Bridge for access to Union Station, which was completed less than 10 months later. The state of New York authorized construction on May 10, 1869, construction began in May 1870, and the first train crossed on December 28, 1871. The bridge consisted of four 185.5-foot (56.5 m) long fixed spans, one 274-foot (84 m) long draw span, seven 73-foot (22 m) long spans over the Albany Basin, one 110-foot (34 m) long span over Quay Street, and one 63-foot (19 m) long span over Maiden Lane. All the spans except the one over Maiden Lane were double tracked, through, and pin connected; the span over Maiden Lane was also double tracked, but was a deck and plate girder span. A reconstruction of the bridge, except for the draw span, was done in 1899 by Pencoyd Bridge Company and finished by January 3, 1900. The bridge lasted until the 1960s, when the Albany–Rensselaer Amtrak station was built on the east side of the Hudson in the city of Rensselaer and Interstate 787 was built along the west side in Albany, thereby eliminating the need of the bridge.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Albany, New York\nDowntown Albany Historic District\nList of fixed crossings of the Hudson River\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The newspaper was founded August 9, 2000 by Dave Price and Jim Pavelich, who also published the Palo Alto Daily News. The Redwood City Daily News was adjudicated as a newspaper of general circulation by the San Mateo County Superior Court in 2001, enabling it to publish legal notices. Both the Palo Alto and Redwood City Daily News editions were distributed in large red newspaper racks and in stores, coffee shops, restaurants, schools and major workplaces. The Redwood City Daily News, along with five other Daily News editions, was sold to Knight Ridder on Feb. 15, 2005. After McClatchy's acquisition of Knight Ridder in early 2006, all six Daily News editions, including the Redwood City Daily News, were bundled with the San Jose Mercury News and sold to MediaNews Group of Denver, Colorado.\nOn November 12, 2004, the Redwood City Daily News became one of the first print media outlets in the United States to report late-breaking news of national interest. The trial of Scott Peterson for the murder of his wife Laci Peterson and their unborn son had taken place at the Redwood City courthouse, and less than an hour after the jury read their verdict the Daily News began circulation of an \"extra\" edition which announced the result.The surviving Daily News papers merged on April 7, 2009.\nPassage 2:\nSawin Millett\nHoward Sawin Millett Jr. (born October 8, 1937) is a Maine politician. A Republican, Millett served as the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services in the administration of Governor Paul LePage from 2011 to 2014. In January 2011, Millett was unanimously approved as Commissioner by the Maine Senate, with key Democrats also endorsing his appointment. In December 2011, a poll of policymakers by the Bangor Daily News ranked Millett as the ninth most influential person in Maine politics.\n\nGovernment career\nMillett served in the administrations of four separate governors (Longley, McKernan, King and LePage) with two different political affiliations (two Independents and two Republicans). Millett advanced in the field of education until he became commissioner of education for Maine's first independent governor, James Longley. He was appointed to the position in 1975 at the age of 37 and served until 1979. In 1979, Republican Governor John McKernan appointed Millett Commissioner of the state finance department. During his time in the McKernan administration, the government was shut down due to the inability to agree on a budget. He also served from 1995 to 2000 as Associate Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services for Independent Angus King. In 2011, Millett was unanimously confirmed as Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services by the Maine Senate after being selected by Republican Paul LePage.\nMillett announced his retirement on April 3, 2014, to be effective on May 30. He stated he wanted to spend more time with his family and in his hometown.  Governor LePage praised his service and knowledge of state budgeting. Millett retired in May 2014 and was replaced by Richard Rosen.\n\nLegislative career\nMillett first served in the legislature from 1969 to 1972. In 2002, Millett won a seat in the Maine House of Representatives. Unable to run for his seat again in 2010, he challenged John Patrick for Senate District 14 and was defeated. In 2018, he won election to the Maine House of Representatives from District 71.\n\nPersonal\nMillett was born in Waterford, Maine in Oxford County, Maine and his family settled on a farm in Dixmont in Penobscot County when he was in fourth grade. Millett's father was a superintendent of schools and his mother was primarily a homemaker. He was one of five boys in his family. Millett, despite being an avid baseball fan and having lived his entire life in Maine, became a supporter of the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1946 World Series in which the Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox. He graduated from Carmel High School in Carmel, Maine in 1955 and attended the same college as his father, Bates College. After graduating, he returned to Penobscot County and began teaching at Hermon High School. He continued teaching in the district until 1971.In 1977, while serving as Commissioner of Education, Millett and his wife bought a home in Manchester, Maine to cut down on his daily commute for work in Augusta, but the couple disliked living in a subdivision so much that he and his wife bought 25 acres of land next to his parents farm in Waterford and built a house to live in.  He could barely stand to address the Maine Senate during his 2011 confirmation hearing due to an infection after knee replacement surgery. Shortly after being appointed commissioner, Millett had to miss work due to a second infection in his knee; he was temporarily replaced by Ryan Low, who had served as Commissioner of Finance under Democrat John Baldacci. Low said of Millett \"I would do just about anything for him...There's no one more of an expert on budgeting and legislative process; but even more than that, he's a genuinely nice person.\"\nPassage 3:\nBurlingame Daily News\nThe Burlingame Daily News was a free daily newspaper in Burlingame, California published six days a week with an average daily circulation of 7,000.

The newspaper was founded May 20, 2005 by journalist Dave Price and Jim Pavelich, who also published the Palo Alto Daily News.. Named the \"Unofficial Ambassador of Good Eating\" by the Maine Department of Agriculture, she wrote a weekly food column for the Bangor Daily News from 1951 to 1994 promoting traditional Maine recipes. She was the main proponent of the claim that the chocolate brownie was invented in Bangor. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nEarly life and education\nSchrumpf was born Mildred Greely Brown on a farm in Readfield Depot, Maine, to Fred Brown and Nellie Mabel Gordon Brown. She was a member of the Kennebec County 4-H club and won a canning contest in her teens. After graduating from Winthrop High School in 1921, Schrumpfh attended the University of Maine – the first person in her family to go to college – and earned a bachelor's degree in home economics in 1925.\n\nCareer\nSchrumpf began her career as a tester for home gas stoves for the Bangor Gas Company. She next worked as an assistant leader in 4-H clubs statewide and as the Penobscot County 4-H club agent through the 1930s, updating home demonstrators on \"food preservation, kitchen design and farm life\". In the 1940s, Schrumpf worked for the United States Department of Agriculture Extension Service, giving demonstrations and classes and also teaching \"camp cookery to forestry students\". She also taught home economics classes at the University of Maine.In the 1950s and 1960s, Schrumpf became the Maine Food Products Promoter for the Maine Department of Agriculture, and also did cooking demonstrations on television.\n\nFood columnist\nSchrumpf began writing a weekly food column called \"Brownie's Kitchen\" for the Bangor Daily News on August 31, 1951. Each column opened with remembrances of life in 20th-century Maine and featured traditional recipes, using simple ingredients that could be found in any Maine grocery. Although she initially eschewed the use of ready-made ingredients, Schrumpf later printed recipes using convenience foods, which were included in her second cookbook collection, Memories from Brownie's Kitchen (1989). She continued producing her column until April 4, 1994.\n\n\"Bangor Brownies\"\nSchrumpf received widespread publicity for her claim that the chocolate brownie was invented in Bangor, Maine. In its first edition (2007), The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink refuted her premise that \"Bangor housewives\" had created the brownie. The Oxford Companion noted that while Schrumpf cited the inclusion of the recipe in the Girl's Welfare Cook Book published in Bangor in 1912 as proof of the brownie's origins, a Fannie Farmer cookbook published in 1905 already contained a recipe for the chewy chocolate treat. However, in its second edition (2013), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America said it had discovered evidence to support Schrumpf's claim, in the form of several 1904 cookbooks that listed a recipe for \"Bangor Brownies\".\n\nOther activities\nSchrumpf served as a judge for the Bangor State Fair and the national Pillsbury Bake-Off. She chaired the Maine Boiler Festival Chicken Barbecues and Luncheons, and headed delegations of Maine food demonstrators to the Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield, Massachusetts.She maintained a lifelong association with the University of Maine and its alumni association, serving as class secretary for 40 years. She provided many artifacts for the \"Brownie's Kitchen\" exhibit, a replica of an early 20th-century farmhouse kitchen, at the Page Farm & Home Museum on the university campus.\n\nHonors and awards\nThe University of Maine alumni association awarded her its Black Bear Award in 1957 and Pine Tree Alumni Service Emblem in 1974. She was named Woman of the Year by the Maine Press, Radio and TV Women in 1968 and \"Unofficial Ambassador of Good Eating\" by the Maine Department of Agriculture in 1970. She received a Kiwanis Recognition in Service Award from the Orono-Old Town Kiwanis chapter in 1976 and an Achievement Citation Award from the Maine chapter of the American Association of University Women in 1989. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nPersonal\nKnown for her lively and energetic personality, she was always happy to answer cooking questions and share recipe advice. As she advanced in years, her birthday celebrations were well-attended affairs that were said to \"require traffic control\"; for one \"birthday bash\", a 20-person committee coordinated the event.She married William E. Schrumpf, an agricultural economist at the University of Maine Agricultural Experimental Station, in 1932; he predeceased her in 1976. In her final years, she resided in a nursing home in Orono, where she died on March 2, 2001, at the age of 98.The Brownie and William E.

The Saints will be looking to end a 6-year silverware drought this season by competing for the Super League XIX title as well as the 113th edition of the Challenge Cup. This season marks Australian Nathan Brown's second season as head coach of the club, continuing from his first season in 2013 which ended in a 5th-place finish and an early playoff exit courtesy of an 11–10 defeat at Leeds Rhinos. They began their season by taking on last seasons runner-up Warrington Wolves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, which ended in an 8–38 win for Saints. This win sent Saints on a win streak that lasted for eight Super League games before being defeated on 18 April 2014 by arch-rivals Wigan Warriors at Langtree Park in the annual Good Friday derby match. Easter was a period to forget for the Saints as they were beaten by Widnes Vikings for their second league defeat in a row, following the Good Friday defeat to bitter rivals Wigan, and then by Leeds Rhinos in Round 5 of the Challenge Cup meaning the Saints will miss out on the trophy for a sixth year. The Saints bounced back however on 1 May with a 48–18 win over the London Broncos. Saints suffered another Magic Weekend to the Warrington Wolves on 18 May with the game ending 41–24 to the Wolves. Results picked up after the Magic Weekend with two straight wins at home against Huddersfield & Salford however the Saints then traveled to Perpignan where they suffered a humiliating 42–0 loss to the Catalans Dragons. Once again, the Saints bounced back with an impressive win over Castleford Tigers at Langtree Park and with another outstanding performance in a pulsating game at the DW Stadium against arch-rivals Wigan Warriors that ended 12–16 in favour of the Saints; the win avenging the Good Friday defeat at Langtree Park. Following this win, Saints suffered a shock 40–10 defeat to Hull Kingston Rovers but bounced back with three straight wins before losing to Hull KR's cross-town rivals, Hull FC, 19–12. However, a 40–16 win over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats & an extremely tight 12–13 win over Leeds Rhinos at Headingley put the Saints in a position where a win against Warrington on 4 September would hand them their first League Leaders' Shield since the 2008 season; with Castleford Tigers being the only other team in contention for the top spot. Despite losing their last two games of the regular season, Saints acquired the League Leaders' Shield following Castleford's failure to beat Catalans Dragons in their last game of the season; meaning that the Saints took their first piece of silverware since 2008. The unlikely success of the 2014 season culminated in a 14–6 win over arch-rivals Wigan Warriors in the 2014 Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford making Saints the Super League champions for the first time since 2006 in an extremely lively, well-fought contest that saw Wigan player Ben Flower sent off for a sucker punch on a defenceless Lance Hohaia in the 2nd minute of the game.\n\n2014 transfers\nPlayers In\n\nPlayers Out\n\n2014 squad\n* Announced on 15 November 2013:\n\nOther staff\nTechnical staff\nBoardroom staff\nPre Season\nSaints began their pre-season by taking on Batley Bulldogs in January 2014; taking a 20–0 victory at home. Following this victory, Saints then took on bitter rivals Wigan Warriors in a 'friendly game', again at Langtree Park, for James Roby's testimonial match, sinking to a disappointing 16–28 defeat. They bounced back however for their last pre-season game before the season began with a 6–62 win away at Rochdale Hornets with a St Helens Select XIII team.\n\nSuper League XIX Fixtures/Results/Table\nSuper League XIX – Play-Off Series\nEven without key players Luke Walsh, Jon Wilkin & Jonny Lomax for the majority of the second half of the season, Saints managed to battle through the play-offs to reach an unprecedented 10th Grand Final. Even though they also lost Lance Hohaia in the second minute of the game via a disgraceful punch from Ben Flower, Saints overcame the solid defence of Wigans remaining 12 men to claim their 5th Super League title.\n\n2014 Tetley's Challenge Cup Fixtures\\Results\nPassage 3:\nShowmatch\nShowmatch was an Argentine television program, broadcast by eltrece. It replaced the comedy show Videomatch in 2004, and from 2006 has produced the dancing contest Bailando por un Sueño (\"Dancing for a Dream\"), along withely proud of that and immensely proud of this storyline. I'm honoured that they've allowed me to be a face for it.\"In December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite storyline of the year had been. He replied \"I'm really pleased with the Christian/Syed storyline. It's bold and we thought long and hard before we did it to make sure we got it right and I'm really proud with what we've done. Marc [Elliott] and John [Partridge] have absolutely stepped up to the plate and like all good EastEnders stories, we're not even half done with it yet. There's miles to go.\"In 2010, Christian will get a beating once his and Syed's secret is revealed. A source explained: \"It seems that Christian is going to take the brunt of Syed's problems. Syed and Amira's wedding achieved one of the highest ratings of the year, so we're expecting viewers to again be gripped when this storyline reaches its dramatic climax. \"There will be lots of twists and turns along the way. And sadly for poor Christian, he'll be the one who ends up taking a battering. There will also be lots of complaints.\" Tahir Shah from the Muslim Public Affairs Committee criticised the storyline as soon as it was reported for portraying Muslims in a negative light.\"EastEnders is known for its gritty and realistic storylines but we cannot condone such violence from a Muslim character,\" he explained. However, gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell described the plot as \"groundbreaking\", adding: \"No storyline in any drama will ever reflect the totality of the many diverse gay lifestyles and experiences. Full credit to the BBC for having a gay Muslim character. The lives of gay Muslims are very rarely in the media.\"\n\nDeparture (2012)\nOn 7 September 2012, it was announced that Syed and Christian would be departing in November 2012 in an explosive storyline that bosses did not reveal at the time. Executive producer, Lorraine Newman said: \"Marc and John have been a fantastic part of the show and their characters have been a huge success. Their storylines have broken boundaries that have not been seen in a soap before and the love for them by the viewers can be seen in their 'Chryed' fans. When Marc announced he had decided to move on, we had a tough decision to make. After numerous conversations, which included John, it was decided that there is only one outcome for Syed and Christian. We wish them both all the best for the future.\" Syed and Christian left together on 15 November 2012.\n\nReturns (2014–2016)\nOn 7 April 2014, it was announced that Christian would be returning in May 2014 for the funeral of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who was to be killed as part of a new storyline (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?).  It was revealed on 11 May 2014 that Christian would return when Jane's ex-husband, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) visited him \"in search of Jane\". Christian returned for two episodes on 19 and 20 May 2014. On 17 January 2015, it was announced that Partridge would be returning again, this time for the show's thirtieth anniversary which would see Christian return for Ian and Jane's wedding. Of his return, Partridge said, \"I am honoured to be returning to EastEnders at this most exciting time to celebrate 30 years of the show, and more importantly to find out who killed Lucy!\" The show's executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, joked that Jane could not get married without having her brother at the occasion and said that the EastEnders team were \"thrilled to have him [Partridge] back\" for the anniversary. Treadwell-Collins then promised that Partridge's \"extensive theatre experience\" would be utilised as he \"is plunged into EastEnders' live week.\" Spoiler images released on 10 February 2015 teased Partridge's return to the show, revealing that Christian would surprise Jane by initially telling her that he is unable to attend the wedding, before revealing himself to her. Partridge later teased another return to the show, saying, \"I can always be lured back!\"On 8 April 2016, it was announced that Partridge would be \"briefly\" returning for a third guest stint in \"early summer\" 2016, alongside Lynda Baron who plays his on-screen mother, Linda Clarke. Their return storyline was billed as \"explosive\" for the Beale family, \"unmissable\", and something that would see \"change in the Beale family forever\". Partridge was confirmed to be filming EastEnders as well as touring with the production of Chicago The Musical. Of his return, Partridge said, \"I am thrilled to be able to return to EastEnders whilst touring the UK with Chicago. Christian is never far from my mind – I turn my back for five minutes and look what happens.\" Partridge returned to filming on 14 April 2016, filming scenes which he believed would air \"around June\". He described returning to filming as \"wonderful\" and compared to \"putting on a nice, comfortable pair of shoes.\" He also praised the EastEnders team for being \"very welcoming\", adding that it \"seemed so natural to be back\" and felt like he had \"never been away\". Partridge confirmed that he would feature in a lot of scenes with Brett as Christian will return to \"look after Jane Beale\". He teased that his return may involve the 'Who Killed Lucy Beale?' storyline and would be part of a \"big year\" for the Beale family.\n\nReception\nThe character's introduction to EastEnders was welcomed by critics, with the Pink News deeming him to be \"a realistic portrayal of a London-based, slightly older gay man.\" Gareth McLean of The Guardian praised the character, saying \"he brings EastEnders a step closer to more accurately resembling London.\"In October 2008, a kiss between Christian and new love interest Lee prompted 145 complaints from viewers who were displeased that homosexual kissing had been broadcast before the 9pm watershed. The BBC released a statement defending the incident, stating: \"EastEnders aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities. We approach our portrayal of homosexual relationships in the same way as we do heterosexual relationships. In this instance, Christian is enjoying the first flush of romance and we've shown him being affectionate with his new boyfriend in the same way any couple would. We also aim to ensure that depictions of affection or sexuality between couples are suitable for pre-watershed viewing. We believe that the general tone and content of EastEnders is now widely recognised, meaning that parents can make an informed decision as to whether they want their children to watch.\"\n\nSee also\nList of EastEnders characters (2008)\nList of LGBT characters in television and radio\nList of soap operas with LGBT characters\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Originally an idea of Joanna Lumley, and strongly supported by then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson, the designer Thomas Heatherwick worked with Arup Group on a proposal by Transport for London (TfL) for a new bridge across the Thames between Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. The proposed concrete, steel, cupronickel clad structure was intended to carry pedestrians, with no cycles or other vehicles. It was to have been located some 200 metres (660 ft) from Waterloo Bridge and 300 m (980 ft) from Blackfriars Bridge, and have included some areas of planting. The project was to include a commercial building, built on former green space at the southern end of the bridge. The bridge was intended to be funded by raising over £140 million of private money (including taxpayer funding through charitable gift aid) and £60 million of promised public money, of which £30m was from Transport for London (£20m of this to be repaid over 55 years) and £30m from the Department for Transport, adding up to projected funding of over £200m. In January 2017, the trustees of the prospective owner of the bridge, the Garden Bridge Trust, stated that costs would \"substantially exceed\" an earlier revised total of £185m and, in April 2017, a report by Margaret Hodge MP concluded, on the basis of the Garden Bridge Trust's own evidence, that the cost would be over £200m.If built, it was proposed that the bridge would have been open from 6am to midnight, with closures for the preparation for and holding of up to 12 private commercial events per year to raise funds for its maintenance. A planning condition required annual maintenance costs to be guaranteed by a third party and it was expected that this would be the Greater London Authority. The annual maintenance costs were variously estimated at between £2m and £3.5m, before allowing for the repayment of loan capital and interest.In July 2016, preparatory work for the bridge was halted and the Garden Bridge Trust put contractors on standby to allow for a financial review and because they had not cleared outstanding issues such as securing legal rights to the land on either side of the river, despite signing a contract for construction of the bridge in January 2016. In September 2016, Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, announced a formal review by Margaret Hodge of the procurement processes in relation to the bridge project and its value for money. In October 2016, the National Audit Office reported on procurement issues and perceived value for money for that part of the cost of the project which was being met by funds (£30m) from the Department for Transport. In January 2017, the trustees of the Garden Bridge Trust (the limited company behind the project) said they were unable to conclude that the trust was a going concern. In February 2017, the Charity Commission for England and Wales found the financial management of the trust to be satisfactory, albeit with criticisms as to the trustees' approach. The subsequent report by Margaret Hodge MP was highly critical of the plan, its procurement, its cost, the risk to public funds, and lack of value for money.The Garden Bridge Trust formally announced on 14 August 2017 that it would be ending the project and that the Garden Bridge Trust itself would be wound up in accordance with the Companies Acts. The failed project cost £53m, including £43m of public money.\n\nOwnership\nThe Garden Bridge Trust, a registered charity (charity registration number 1155246) and a company limited by guarantee registered in England and Wales, and with an exemption from use of the term \"Limited\",  was to own the bridge, as private space in the public realm. The company was incorporated on 30 October 2013 under reference 08755461. Lord Davies of Abersoch is chairman of the trust and a director of the limited company.\n\nDesign\nThe bridge would have been 366 metres (1,201 ft) long and 30 metres (98 ft) across at its widest point. It would have run from the roof of Temple tube station at the foot of Arundel Street on the north bank to Queen's Walk on the South Bank, next to ITV's London Studios, where a public green open space would have been sacrificed and built upon to provide a commercial building associated with the bridge, with removal of some 28 mature trees. The new building would have housed a combination of public toilets, maintenance facilities, and operational areas, together with an events space which was intended to be occupied by Coin Street Community Builders who have a long lease of the area on which the building would have been constructed. The bridge would have featured trees and shrubs, hedging plants and climbers, perennials, ferns and grasses, and bulbs. Its construction would have required the felling of mature trees on both sides of the river, including 28 plane trees in the avenue on Queen's Walk which were planted in theLondon\nSavoy Chapel\nSavoy Theatre\nPassage 9:\nWaterloo Helmet\nThe Waterloo Helmet (also known as the Waterloo Bridge Helmet) is a pre-Roman Celtic bronze ceremonial horned helmet with repoussé decoration in the La Tène style, dating to circa 150–50 BC, that was found in 1868 in the River Thames by Waterloo Bridge in London, England. It is now on display at the British Museum in London.\n\nDiscovery\nThe helmet was dredged from the bed of the River Thames close to Waterloo Bridge in 1868, and in March of the same year it was given on loan to the British Museum by Thames Conservancy. In 1988 its successor body, the Port of London Authority, donated the helmet to the British Museum.\n\nDescription\nThe main part of the helmet is constructed from two sheets of bronze, one forming the front and one the back of the helmet, that are riveted together at the sides and top. A separate crescent-shaped bronze piece is riveted to the bottom of the front sheet, and two conical bronze horns with terminal knobs are riveted to the top of the helmet.  A decorative strip with a row of rivets overlays the join between the front and back sheets, and goes around the base of the horns. At the end of the strip, on both sides of the helmet, is a ring fitting for a chin-strap or cheekpiece. There are a number of small holes around the bottom edge, which may have been used to attach a lining.The helmet was decorated with six bronze studs, one of which is now missing, three on the front and three on the back. These have cross scores on them that suggest they were designed to hold red glass enamel studs, but these are no longer present.There is also a repoussé decoration in the La Tène style on the front and back of the helmet. The design is similar to that on the Snettisham Great Torc.\n\nPurpose\nBeing made from thin bronze sheets, the helmet would have been too fragile for use in battle, and so it was probably intended to be used for ceremonial or parade purposes. In this respect it is similar to Iron Age bronze shields that have been found, which would not have been effective against contemporary weapons and could only have been used for display purposes.  Alternatively, it has been suggested that the helmet is in any case too small for most adult males, and may have been worn by a wooden statue of a Celtic deity.It is thought that the reason why the Waterloo Helmet and ceremonial bronze shields such as the Battersea Shield and Witham Shield were all found in rivers is that they were thrown into the river as votive offerings to the gods.\n\nImportance\nThe Waterloo Helmet is one of only three Iron Age helmets found in England and also the only horned helmet dating to the Iron Age to have been found anywhere in Europe. However, there are several Iron Age depictions of people wearing horned helmets from elsewhere in Europe. There are some carvings of Gauls wearing horned helmets on the triumphal arch at Orange, France, dating to c.55 BC, but these are very different from the Waterloo Helmet. Whereas the Waterloo Helmet has straight, conical horns with a broad base that are stylised representations of animal horns, the helmets depicted on the carvings at Orange show realistic, curved bull's horns between which is placed an upright wheel. Similar to the depictions on the triumphal arch of Orange is the image of a leaping figure wearing a horned helmet and holding a wheel on the Gundestrup cauldron from Denmark, dating to the 1st century BC. This helmet is of a different shape from the Waterloo Helmet, and the horns are curved like those at Orange, but like the Waterloo Helmet the horns of the helmet are not sharply pointed, but are fitted with terminal knobs. An Iron Age bas-relief at Brague, near Antibes in France, also shows representations of people wearing horned helmets.Despite the depictions of horned helmets on the triumphal arch of Orange and elsewhere, the Waterloo Helmet remains the only known example of an actual horned helmet from this period, and other Iron Age helmets that have been found, such as the Canterbury helmet and the Meyrick Helmet from northern Britain, are hornless. Nevertheless, influenced by the iconic features of the Waterloo Helmet, modern artistic interpretations of Iron Age people tend to show them wearing horned helmets, which has led Miranda Aldhouse-Green, professor of archaeology at Cardiff University, to comment that it is \"unfortunate that it has found such a firm place in many popular reconstructions of British warriors\".\n\nGallery of reconstructions\nSee also\nCanterbury helmet\nBattersea shield\nWandsworth Shield\nWitham Shield\nPassage 10:\nWaterloo Road, London\nWaterloo Road is the main road in the Waterloo district of London, England straddling the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAmerican Nerd\nAmerican Nerd: The Story of My People is a book by Benjamin Nugent. The book discusses the history and origin of the term \"nerd\", as well as what the term means in today's age. Some of the important topics discussed include the racial differences for the term \"nerd\", such as how race played into Urkel, a nerdy character played by Jaleel White on the TV series Family Matters.\n\nAppearances\nThe book and the author were featured on Last Call with Carson Daly as well as The Sound of Young America on NPR.\nPassage 2:\nSteve Urkel\nSteven Quincy Urkel is a fictional character on the American ABC/CBS sitcom Family Matters, portrayed by Jaleel White. Although originally slated to be a one-time-only character on the show, he broke out to be its most popular character and gradually became its protagonist.  Due to the Urkel character's off-putting characteristics and the way he would stir up events and underscore the plot or even move it along, he is considered a nuisance by the original protagonist's family, the Winslows, though they come to accept him over time.\nThe character is the epitome of a geek or nerd of the era, due to traits such as large, thick eyeglasses, flood pants held up by suspenders, multi-colored cardigan sweaters, saddle shoes, and a high-pitched voice. He professes love for his neighbor Laura Winslow, who is a character in the main family of the series, but this love of his is written as an accent on or trigger for events and crises and is therefore unrequited until the series' end.\nThroughout the series, starting from Urkel's debut, he is central to many of its running gags, primarily property damage and/or personal injury resulting from of his inventions going awry or his outright clumsiness. He becomes known by viewers and characters alike for several catchphrases uttered after some humorous misfortune occurs, including \"I've fallen and I can't get up!\" \"I don't have to take this. I'm going home.\" \"Did I do that?\" \"Whoa, Mama!\" and \"Look what you did!\" (on occasions when someone else caused the damage, though usually the accident was indirectly caused by Urkel).\n\nCharacter development\nIn syndication, Steve Urkel first appeared on the 4th episode of the first season, \"Rachel's First Date\" (as the show staff wanted to more naturally introduce him to audiences upon repeated viewings). In the 12th episode of the first season, \"Laura's First Date\", he reappears as a nerdy young boy who takes Laura Winslow out on a date. Despite him being madly in love with her, Laura finds Steve grating and doesn't return his affection. \nWhile initially intended to be a minor character, Urkel became very popular for his oddball antics, soon becoming a recurring character and joining the main cast, beginning with the season-two premiere \"Rachel's Place\".Family Matters co-creator Michael Warren named the character after his friend, writer, and director Steve Urkel. Due to the show and the character's tremendous popularity during the early 1990s, Erkel encountered difficulties using his own name; he received many prank phone calls from \"Laura\" asking for \"Steve\", and businesses found his name to be suspicious. Warren stated that had he known if the character would reappear for years, he would not have named him after his friend.\n\nPortrayal\nSteve Urkel embodies the stereotype of a socially inept intellectual who means well but often messes things up. Despite his intelligence, his actions often come across as clumsy and foolish. He is fiercely protective of and obsessed with his unrequited love, Laura Winslow, and this admiration extends to the rest of the Winslow family. However, Steve is comically clumsy and inept, and his attempts to help the Winslows often go awry. This puts him at odds with the family patriarch, Carl, who routinely throws Urkel out of his house. He has been shown to take responsibility for his own mistakes and reimburses the Winslows for the damages he's done. Steve is close to Harriette Winslow, who is delighted each time he comes over, much to Carl's chagrin.\nLater episodes suggest that Steve's attachment to the Winslows stems from his bad relationship with his own family. Urkel often hints that most of his relatives, including his (never seen) parents, despise him and refuse to associate with him. This culminates in the two moving to Russia without him, whereupon he moves in with the Winslows. The show has also revealed that Steve has at least four relatives who care about him who are Uncle Ernie who owns a horse trailer; Uncle Cecil who, despite his gambling problems, visits the Urkel home to keep an eye on him; Aunt Oona from Altoona, (played by singer, Donna Summer), who is like a mother to him; and cousin Myrtle. In the series finale, Steve responds to Carl talking about how proud he is of his future son-in-law by saying \"Thanks, Dad.\"\nUrkel dresses unfashionably for someone his age (he is most commonly seen wearing suspenders, brightly colored shirts, and high water pants) and has a number of hobbies and interests, including polka dancing and accordion playing. His motor vehicle of choice is the small three-wheeled Isetta. Unlike his friends, he has little interest in popular culture and athletic endeavors, though he enjoys playing basketball, once attempting to join the school team. This has caused Myra to be attracted to Urkel himself due to them not being interested in pop culture. However, Steve has shown little interest in her mainly due to her stalker behavior.\nWhile he is unpopular with his schoolmates, Urkel is a brilliant student and is on a first-name basis with his teachers. He is a genius inventor as well, and his fantastical but unreliable gadgets (including a transformation device and a time machine) are central to many Family Matters plots and gags.\nUrkel also has an adept sense of lawbreaking that involves peer pressure. This was explored four times, mainly with Eddie, since he often has to learn his lesson the hard way when he finds himself in situations outside of his control.\n\nStefan Urquelle\nDuring the season five episode \"Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool\", in a takeoff on The Nutty Professor films, Urkel devises a plan to win Laura's heart: transforming his DNA using a serum, which suppresses his \"nerd genes\" and brings out his \"cool\" genes. This results in the alter ego known as Stefan Urquelle, played by Jaleel White in more casual attire. Initially, Laura is enamored with the smoother Stefan, but asks that he turn back into Steve when Stefan's self-centeredness makes itself apparent.\nSteve improves the formula in the season five episode \"Stefan Returns\" to reduce its negative effects on his personality, and invents a \"transformation chamber\" allowing him to become Stefan at will. He would change into Stefan several timesincluding his alter ego Stefan Urquelle and Myrtle Urkel. During the height of Family Matters' popularity, the character of Urkel was marketed with breakfast cereal (Urkel-Os) and an Urkel doll. In addition to starring in the series, White also wrote several episodes, including one, at age 19, that was the series' highest rated for that year. The series was a staple of ABC's TGIF lineup and became one of the longest-running sitcoms with a predominantly black cast in television history.In 1992, he was featured in The Jaleel White Special, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself making a film, while also playing Steve Urkel.By the time the series ended in 1998, White, who was then 21 years old, was disillusioned with the role, and had been shaken by the death of his close friend and co-star Michelle Thomas from an aggressive form of stomach cancer. Shortly after the series' cancellation, he stated in a 1999 interview, \"If you ever see me do that character again, take me out and put a bullet in my head and put me out of my misery.\" Due to the character's popularity, White was so tightly defined by his Urkel character that he encountered difficulty finding other roles.In later years, White came to terms with the character. In a 2011 interview with Vanity Fair, he addressed the 1999 \"bullet\" quote stating, \"It's one of those things that it's very unfortunate how quotes are taken out of context. I remember that interview very vividly. I loved playing those characters ... But the fact is that I was maturing. ... To be honest, I was retarding my own growth as a man to maintain the authenticity to what I thought that character should be.\" When asked if he would ever reprise the Steve Urkel role, White said, \"I'll always say never say never; I'm a pretty creative person. I can't envision how I could do it in a way that would be irreverent and fun for both me and the viewing audience\".\n\nOther career highlights\nWhite was the original English voice of the popular video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, having been cast in 1993 (pre-dating Martin Burke and Ryan Drummond). He voiced the character in all of the DiC-produced animated series: Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic SatAM, and Sonic Underground, as well as the Christmas special, Sonic Christmas Blast. In Underground, White also voiced Sonic's brother and sister, Manic and Sonia. White did not return to voice Sonic when Sonic X was released in 2003.\nIn 1999, White returned to television in the UPN sitcom Grown Ups. The series was based around White as a young man striking out into adulthood. He also co-produced and wrote some episodes for the show, in which he starred as \"J\", a college graduate struggling to establish his role in life as an adult. The pilot episode featured another former child actor, Soleil Moon Frye, known for her role as Punky Brewster, as the girl whom he chose as a roommate. The show received poor reviews from critics but debuted in second place in the ratings upon its premiere. However, ratings soon dropped and UPN canceled the series after one season.White's acting roles have not been restricted to sitcoms. He has provided his voice to several animated projects including Warner Bros.' 1998 film Quest for Camelot. In 1999, he provided the voice for a teenaged Martin Luther King Jr., in Our Friend, Martin.\nIn 2001, White graduated from UCLA with a degree in film and television. He has continued acting and has had small parts in the films Big Fat Liar (in a cameo role) and Dreamgirls, and was featured as the lead role in the direct-to-DVD comedy Who Made the Potatoe Salad? in 2006. In 2007, he guest-starred on the CW series The Game, followed by a role as a law school graduate interviewing for a job at Crane, Poole and Schmidt in the ABC legal drama Boston Legal.In June 2009, White began appearing in the web series Road to the Altar. In the series, White stars as Simon, a 30-something black man marrying a young Jewish girl named Rochelle. In September 2009, White guest starred on the USA Network series Psych, as an estranged college singing buddy of the character Gus.\nIn June 2010, White starred in the web series Fake It Till You Make It. He also serves as writer and producer of the series. The series, which premiered on Hulu, follows the exploits of former child star Reggie Cullen (White) turned image consultant and his three protégés as they hustle to navigate Hollywood. In March 2011, White guest starred on the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet?, which reunited him with fellow Family Matters cast member Telma Hopkins. Later that same year, White appeared as the star in Cee-Lo Green's music video for his song \"Cry Baby\".In October 2011, White appeared in the season 8 premiere of House, titled \"Twenty Vicodin\", where he appears as a well-connected inmate, occasionally helping Hugh Laurie's character Gregory House to sneak contraband into the prison. In April 2012, White began hosting the Syfy game show Total Blackout.In March 2012, White began competing on the 14th season of Dancing with the Stars. He was partnered with two-time dance champion Kym Johnson. In the opening night's performance, White and Johnson danced the Foxtrot to \"The Way You Look Tonight\". They earned a total of 26 points out of 30.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWilliam Wallace\nSir William Wallace (Scottish Gaelic: Uilleam Uallas, pronounced [ˈɯʎam ˈuəl̪ˠəs̪]; Norman French: William le Waleys; c. 1270 – 23 August 1305) was a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the First War of Scottish Independence.Along with Andrew Moray, Wallace defeated an English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297. He was appointed Guardian of Scotland and served until his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298. In August 1305, Wallace was captured in Robroyston, near Glasgow, and handed over to King Edward I of England, who had him hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason and crimes against English civilians.\nSince his death, Wallace has obtained a legendary status far beyond his homeland. He is the protagonist of Blind Harry's 15th-century epic poem The Wallace and the subject of literary works by Jane Porter and Sir Walter Scott, and of the Academy Award-winning film Braveheart.\n\nBackground\nWilliam Wallace was a member of the lesser nobility, but little is definitely known of his family history or even his parentage. William's own seal, found on a letter sent to the Hanse city of Lübeck in 1297, gives his father's name as Alan Wallace. This Alan Wallace may be the same as the one listed in the 1296 Ragman Rolls as a crown tenant in Ayrshire, but there is no additional confirmation. Others have speculated this Alan held an Ellerslie, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, and if true, the estate could be a possible birthplace for William; though there is no record of Wallaces' holding the estate, in the mid 13th century. Blind Harry's late-15th-century poem offers an alternate father for William, a Sir Malcolm of Elderslie, in Renfrewshire; and has similarly given rise to a possible birthplace for William. There is no contemporary evidence linking him with either location, although both areas had connections with the wider Wallace family. Records show early members of the family as holding estates at Riccarton, Tarbolton, Auchincruive in Kyle and Stenton in East Lothian. They were vassals of James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland as their lands fell within his territory. It has been claimed that Wallace's brothers Malcolm and John are known from other sources, but there is a lack of verifiable evidence for John’s relationship with William.The origins of the Wallace surname and its association with southwest Scotland are also far from certain, other than the name's being derived from the Old English wylisc (pronounced \"wullish\"), meaning \"foreigner\" or \"Welshman\". It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but as the term was also used for the Cumbric-speaking Strathclyde kingdom of the Celtic Britons, it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being \"Welsh\" due to their Cumbric language. A family tradition states Wallace was descended from the sister of Saint Patrick, which would reinforce the Welsh origin theory.\n\nMilitary career\nPolitical crisis in Scotland\nWhen Wallace was growing up, King Alexander III ruled Scotland. His reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians. Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney in late September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the \"Great Cause\", with a total of thirteen contenders laying claim to the throne. The most credible claims were John Balliol and Robert Bruce, grandfather of the future king Robert the Bruce.With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, judgment was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law based on being senior in genealogical primogeniture even though not in proximity of blood.Edward proceeded to take steps to progressively undermine John's authority, treating Scotland as a feudal vassal state, demanding homage be paid towards himself and military support in his war against France — even summoning King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. The Scots soon tired of their deeply compromised king, and the direction of affairs was allegedly taken out of his hands by the leading men of the kingdom, who appointed a Council of Twelve—in practice, a new panel of Guardians—at Stirling in July 1295. They went on to conclude a treaty of mutual assistance with France—known in later years as the Auld Alliance.In retaliation for Scotland's treaty with France, Edward I invaded, storming Berwick-upon-Tweed and commencing the Wars of Scottish Independence. The Scots were defeated at Dunbar and the English took Dunbar Castle on 27 April 1296. Edward forced John to abdicate, which he did at Stracathro near Montrose on 10 July 1296. Here the arms of Scotland were formally torn from John's surcoat, giving him the abiding name of \"Toom Tabard\" (empty coat). By July, Edward had instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time).\n\nSilent years prior to the Wars of Independence\nSome historians believe Wallace must have had some earlier military experience in order to lead a successful military campaign in 1297. Campaigns like Edward I of England's wars in Wales might have provided a good opportunity for a younger son of a landholder to become a mercenary soldier. Wallace's personal seal bears the archer's insignia, so he may have fought as an archer in Edward's army.\nWalter Bower states that Wallace was \"a tall man with the body of a giant ... with lengthy flanks ... broad in the hips, with strong arms and legs ... with all his limbs very strong and firm\". Blind Harry's Wallace reaches seven feet.\n\nStart of the uprising\nThe first act definitely known to have been carried out by Wallace was his killing of William de Heselrig, the English High Sheriff of Lanark, in May 1297. He then joined with William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas, and they carried out the raid of Scone. This was one of several rebellions taking place across Scotland, including those of several Scottish nobles and Andrew Moray in the north.The uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the English at Irvine in July. Wallace and Moray were not involved, and continued their, Ayrshire were given to Roger, son of Finlay, in a charter from Robert de Brus, where it mentions a brother and a son.\n\nCitations\nPassage 7:\nWilliam Oliphant (died after 1313)\nSir William Oliphant (died aft. 1313), was a Scottish knight and Governor of Stirling Castle during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He switched loyalties to the English and died in a Scottish prison.\n\nLife\nSir William Oliphant fought at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, where the Scots, under their king John Balliol, were defeated by the invading English. Following the battle he was captured and taken to Devizes Castle in England where he was imprisoned. He was freed on 8 September 1297 and with his fellow prisoner John of Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl returned to Scotland to serve in King Edward I's army. Breaking his pledge to Edward I, he next appears as the governor of Stirling Castle and when attacked by King Edward's army he refused to surrender without permission of the Guardian of Scotland, John de Soules who was in France at the time. His small garrison held out against the full might of Edward's army until 20 July 1304 when they were forced to surrender. While Edward agreed to favorable terms in writing, immediately after the surrender he broke the terms and imprisoned Oliphant in the Tower of London. In this same year all of Scotland with the exception of William Wallace swore fealty to Edward I.In 1308, he was released on mainprise on 24 May 1308 and shortly afterwards returned to Scotland where he served king Edward II of England. In 1309 he was at Stirling castle. By 1312 Sir William was in command of the key English outpost, the fortified town of Perth. A six-week siege by Robert the Bruce had little effect so the Scots withdrew in open sight of the English garrison. Little more than a week later after nightfall, the Scots crossed the Lade, Perth's moat at the time, and climbed the wall. They took the town with little bloodshed. However many of the higher ranking Scots and English were executed while most of the English were allowed to go free. Sir William However, John Barbour said that King Robert \"commanded on great pains\" that only those who could not be captured were to be killed. Since Oliphant was not executed but was sent in chains to the western Isles, where he apparently died a prisoner there is some reason to think Barbour was correct. There is no further mention of him in any records.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nBernard de Monte Alto\nSir Bernard de Monte Alto (de Mowat) was a Scottish knight who took part in the War of Scottish Independence, as a supporter of Robert de Brus.\nBernard was the son of Roger de Monte Alto, Sheriff of Cromarty and the younger brother of William de Monte Alto. He was with Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Methven on 19 June 1306 and was captured by English forces under Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. He was drawn and hanged at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 4 August 1306. Bernard was executed for bearing arms against King Edward I of England on the side of Robert de Brus, fighting at the Battle of Methven, and killing Roger de Tany, the king's valet, in Selkirk Forest.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nReginald Crawford (died 1307)\nSir Reginald Crawford (died 17 February 1307) was a Scottish knight who took part in the Wars of Scottish Independence.\nIn 1296 he was appointed as Sheriff of Ayr by the English administration.  In June 1297 he was one of several Scots nobles who did a deal where they were released by the English to fight against Andrew Moray.  This suggests that he may have taken  part in the revolt in early 1297 which ended in the capitulation at Irvine. \nHe became a supporter of Robert the Bruce and was captured during the Battle of Loch Ryan in February 1307. He was executed by hanging in Carlisle, England.He may have been related to the Ronald Crawford who was hanged at the Barns of Ayr, but this issue is surrounded by uncertainty and later legend.\nPassage 10:\nDavid, Lord of Brechin\nSir David de Brechin (died 1320) was a Scottish knight who fought on both sides during the Wars of Scottish Independence.\n\nLife\nHe was the son of Sir William de Brechin by Elena Comyn, daughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan and Elizabeth de Quincy. Sir William was the son of Henry, an illegitimate son of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. Brechin is first attested to as a ward of a Sir John de Callendar in 1292.Brechin fought in the Earl of Surrey's army at the Battle of Dunbar, and was granted lands previously owned by Alan Durward.He name appears twice on the 1296 Ragman Rolls for Forfarshire.In the train of Robert the Bruce, he was present at Peebles when the Bruce, John Comyn, and William Lamberton were sworn in as Guardians of Scotland. Brechin returned to Galloway with Bruce.By 1301, Sir David was still active in southwestern Scotland. On 8 September Brechin was in a force led by Sir John de Soulis and Sir Ingram de Umfraville, that attacked Lochmaben Castle, and was wounded in the fight.Brechin returned to English service when he did homage to Edward I of England at the Siege of Stirling Castle.Continuing in English service, Brechin was present at the Battle of Inverurie, and according to John Barbour, he retired after the battle to Brechin Castle where he was besieged by David Earl of Atholl. However this is contested by the historian and genealogist Sir James Balfour Paul. According to all records, Strathbogie was still in the service of the English, so the capture of Brechin Castle must have been accomplished by another of King Robert's following.On 6 April 1320, Brechin appended his seal to the Declaration of Arbroath.\nAt a parliament at Scone (later known as the Black Parliament) in August that year, Brechin was found complicit along with William de Soules, the Countess of Strathearn and others in a conspiracy to depose the king.  For this offence Brechin was executed.Although there is no reason to doubt his guilt, his execution surprised many people, as he was seen as a \"flower of chivalry\", having acquitted himself well in battle against the Saracens during the crusades.\n\nMarriages and issue\nBrechin appears to have married Margaret de Bonkyll, widow of Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll, by 1304 when she is recorded as his wife. and had issue.\n\nMargaret de Brechin, married in 1315 to Sir David de BarclayDavid de Brechin appears to have married secondly a Margaret Ramsay.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "[INST]Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nYou're the Apple of My Eye\n\"You're the Apple of My Eye\" is a song written by Otis Blackwell and initially recorded and released as a single in 1956 by The Four Lovers, the precursor to The Four Seasons. Recorded after they were denied the opportunity to record another Blackwell song, \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"You're the Apple of My Eye\" was The Four Lovers' first exposure to U.S. national publicity, reaching the #62 position on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning the quartet an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. One of two Four Lovers singles that RCA Victor Records released simultaneously, it was the quartet's only foray onto the Hot 100 before the formation of The Four Seasons five years later.\n\nBackground\nThe Four Lovers (1956 personnel: Frankie Valli, Nick and Tommy DeVito, and Hank Majewski) was the eventual result of Valli joining The Variety Trio in 1954 to form The Variatones (which briefly included mutual friends on a part-time basis). The group performed at various New Jersey clubs and lounges and established a reputation for its musical versatility, incorporating country music, pop music, doo wop, Broadway standards, rhythm and blues, and an occasional foray into Italian love songs.\nAn RCA Records executive saw a Four Lovers performance and was impressed with the presentation enough to recommend the quartet to the company's artists and repertoire department. They were signed to the RCA Victor label for a series of records to be released in 1956 and 1957. In May 1956, \"You're the Apple of My Eye\"/\"The Girl of My Dreams\" and \"Lovey Dovey\"/\"Please Don't Love Me\" were released simultaneously by RCA. The four sides were recorded in a single April session (with two other songs that were released as a single in January 1957).\n\nLegacy\nThe song was featured in the jukebox musical: Jersey Boys as well as the film version.\n\n\"You're the Apple of My Eye\"/\"The Girl of My Dreams\"\nRCA Victor 47-6518. \"You're the Apple of My Eye\" was a last-minute substitution for another song that Frankie Valli and the group was preparing to do in the recording session, \"Don't Be Cruel\". Accounts differ as to the precise mechanism behind their not recording the Otis Blackwell song. Some sources indicate that The Four Lovers were told not to record the song as Elvis Presley expressed a desire to record the song himself; other sources indicate that Blackwell himself requested that the Four Lovers not record the song so he could \"shop around\" for a bigger act (and a better royalty deal) for the song (and succeeded when Presley's manager approached Blackwell with the idea of Presley recording \"Don't Be Cruel\").\nBlackwell later apologized for \"taking the song away from\" The Four Lovers and offered a different original composition for the quartet to record. Produced by Blackwell, \"You're the Apple of My Eye\" was composed as a \"traditional\" rhythm-and-blues song, but the Four Lovers gave it more of a rock'n'roll interpretation (some music critics referred to it as so \"over the top\" as to be close in style to burlesque).\nThe single was the group's first attempt into national publicity, with sales and airplay sufficient for the record to enter the Hot 100 and to generate enough interest for Ed Sullivan to invite the group onto his weekly television program. \"Apple of My Eye\" was the only Four Lovers Single to achieve chart status as the other six successive singles sank without a trace in 1956 and 1957.\nAfter the Four Lovers became The Four Seasons in 1961, \"You're the Apple of My Eye\" was re-recorded (as \"Apple of My Eye\") for the Sherry and 11 Others album (1962). The re-recording was released as a single in October 1964 and appeared briefly on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 record chart.\nThe B-side of The Four Lovers single, \"The Girl of My Dreams\", is a cover of a song composed by Maxwell Davis, Joe Josea, Jules Taub, and Sam Ling. Jessie Belvin and Eugene Church recorded and released a recording of the song in 1956 as The Cliques.\n\n\"Honey Love\"/\"Please Don't Leave Me\"\nRCA Victor 47-6519. Released the same day as \"You're the Apple of My Eye\", The Four Lovers' second single featured covers of two rhythm-and-blues hits from the mid-1950s. The A-side, \"Honey Love\", was a considerable R&B hit for The Drifters in 1956. It was composed by Drifters lead singer Clyde McPhatter and Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler. The Four Lovers' version was similar in style to the original, but didn't come close to attaining the level of success of either the original or \"You're the Apple of Your Eye\".\nThe B-side of the group's second single, \"Please Don't Leave Me\", was composed by Antoine \"Fats\" Domino and was originally recorded by him in 1953. It is one of the more blues-based songs in the Fats Domino catalog — and one of the most blues-based songs ever recorded by Frankie Valli and his friends, regardless of the name or membership of the group.\n\nAfter \"Apple\" and \"Honey\"\nThe management or RCA Victor and The Four Lovers were encouraged by the success of \"You're the Apple of My Eye\" to make arrangements for recording an album for release for Christmas sales. The result, Joyride, had a collection of rhythm-and-blues and western covers, with a few pop standards and a handful of never-before-released songs, complete with a rollicking version of \"White Christmas\", patterned similar to the Drifters' version from 1955. In addition, RCA was releasing Four Lovers' singles roughly every two weeks, including covers of Hank Williams' \"Jambalaya\", Faye Adams' \"Shake a Hand\", and an early vocal version of \"Night Train\".\nJoyride and the last five RCA Victor Four Lovers singles failed to chart and failed to sell. Today, they are collector's items, with the album being worth up to $400 (US) in near mint condition and some of the singles at roughly one-third that. The group's last single, \"My Life for You Love\"/\"Pucker Up\", sold so few that the relative handful of existing copies are now selling for up to $3000 each.\nBy the end of 1957, The Four Lovers had no recording contract and returned to performing in clubs and lounges before being put \"on hiatus\", albeit briefly before a new artists contract with Bob Crewe's Peri Records gave the group a new purpose for its existence, that of supporting musicians with the occasional opportunity to record songs on their own (which they did — and release under a variety of names between 1958 and she was in her apartment near Ground Zero when the attacks occurred. However, some reports have instead attributed the cancer to Summer's smoking during her younger years, her continued exposure to second-hand smoking while performing in clubs well after she had quit, and a predisposition to this disease in the family. Summer was survived by her husband, Bruce Sudano, and her three daughters.Summer's funeral service was held in Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee, on the afternoon of May 23, 2012. The exact location and time of the service were kept private. Several hundred of Summer's friends and relatives attended the funeral, according to CNN. The funeral was a private ceremony, and cameras were not allowed inside the church. She was interred in the Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens cemetery in Nashville.\n\nReaction\nSingers and music industry professionals around the world reacted to Summer's death. Gloria Gaynor said she was \"deeply saddened\" and that Summer was \"a fine lady and human being\". Liza Minnelli said, \"She was a queen, The Queen Of Disco, and we will be dancing to her music forever.\" She said that her \"thoughts and prayers are with her family always.\" Dolly Parton said, \"Donna, like Whitney, was one of the greatest voices ever. I loved her records. She was the disco queen and will remain so. I knew her and found her to be one of the most likable and fun people ever. She will be missed and remembered.\" Janet Jackson wrote that Summer \"changed the world of music with her beautiful voice and incredible talent.\" Barbra Streisand wrote, \"I loved doing the duet with her. She had an amazing voice and was so talented. It's so sad.\" Quincy Jones wrote that Summer's voice was \"the heartbeat and soundtrack of a generation.\"Aretha Franklin said, \"It's so shocking to hear about the passing of Donna Summer. In the 1970s, she reigned over the disco era and kept the disco jumping. Who will forget 'Last Dance'? A fine performer and a very nice person.\" Chaka Khan said, \"Donna and I had a friendship for over 30 years. She is one of the few black women I could speak German with and she is one of the few friends I had in this business.\" Gloria Estefan averred that \"It's the end of an era\", and posted a photo of herself with Summer. Mary J. Blige tweeted \"RIP Donna Summer !!!!!!!! You were truly a game changer !!!\" Lenny Kravitz wrote \"Rest in peace Donna, You are a pioneer and you have paved the way for so many of us. You transcended race and genre. Respect. Lenny\".Beyoncé wrote a personal note: \"Donna Summer made music that moved me both emotionally and physically to get up and dance. You could always hear the deep passion in her voice. She was so much more than the queen of disco she became known for, she was an honest and gifted singer with flawless vocal talent. I've always been a huge fan and was honored to sample one of her songs. She touched many generations and will be sadly missed. My love goes out to her family during this difficult time. Love, B\".David Foster said, \"My wife and I are in shock and truly devastated. Donna changed the face of pop culture forever. There is no doubt that music would sound different today if she had never graced us with her talent. She was a super-diva and a true superstar who never compromised when it came to her career or her family. She always did it with class, dignity, grace and zero attitude. She lived in rare air ... She was the most spectacular, considerate, constant, giving, generous and loving friend of 35 years. I am at a total loss trying to process this tragic news.\"US President Barack Obama said, \"Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Donna Summer. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Donna truly was the 'Queen of Disco.' Her voice was unforgettable and the music industry has lost a legend far too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Donna's family and her dedicated fans.\"Summer was honored at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards ceremony. Singer Natasha Bedingfield honored Summer, calling her \"a remarkable woman who brought so much light and who inspired many women, including myself, through her music. And if we can remember her through her music, this will never really be the last dance.\" After her statement, she began to sing \"Last Dance\", Summer's Academy Award-winning song. As she sang the song, photos of Summer were displayed on a screen overhead.Fans paid tribute to Summer by leaving flowers and memorabilia on her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. A few days after her death, her album sales increased by 3,277%, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Billboard magazine reported that the week before she died, Summer sold about 1,000 albums. After her death that number increased to 26,000.\n\nLegacy\nAccording to singer Marc Almond, Summer's collaboration with producer Giorgio Moroder \"changed the face of music\". Summer was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach No. 1 on Billboard's album chart: Live and More, Bad Girls and On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II. She became a cultural icon and her prominence on the dance charts, for which she was referred to as the Queen of Disco, made her not just one of the defining voices of that era, but also an influence on pop artists from Madonna to Beyoncé. Unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular in the early 1980s, Summer was able to grow beyond the genre and segued to a pop-rock sound. She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with \"She Works Hard For the Money\", which became another anthem, this time for women's rights. Summer was the first black woman to be nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. Summer remained a force on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs chart throughout her career and notched 16 number one singles. Her last studio album, 2008's Crayons, spun off three No. 1 dance/club hits with \"I'm a Fire\", \"Stamp Your Feet\" and \"Fame (The Game)\". In May 2012, it was announced that \"I Feel Love\" was included in the list of preserved recordings at the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. Her Rock and Roll Hall of Fame page listed Summer as \"the Diva De Tutte Dive, the first true diva of the modern pop era\".In 2018, Summer: The Donna Summer Musical, a biographical musical featuring Summer's songs, began performances on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, following a 2017 world premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.In the 2019 film How to Build a Girl, Donna Summer is among the figures featured in Johanna's wall collage.In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Summer at number 122 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nConcert tours\nDiscography\nFilmography\nAwards and nominations\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The shoemaker, purportedly Britain's oldest and one of the first manufacturers in Norfolk, was established in 1792 in Norwich, England, by James Smith. His grandson, James Southall, gave the firm its current name; it rose in prominence during the 20th century thanks in part to an iconic poster, reading Children's shoes have far to go, which was displayed on the London Underground for 20 years from 1947. Controversy exists around the origins of the image in this poster. It has been attributed to artists  Andy Wood, William Grimmond, Joe Wilkinson of Stanley Studios, Susan Pearce, Nancy Gardner and to the company's own advertising agent.In 1955 Start-rite was granted a royal warrant by Queen Elizabeth II to supply footwear for the young Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.  The company was granted a second royal warrant in 1989 by the Prince of Wales to supply children's footwear for Prince William and Prince Harry. This royal warrant was withdrawn in 2003 on production being moved from the UK. In 2016 Prince George was pictured wearing Start-rite shoes in an official portrait taken to commemorate the 90th birthday of the Queen.In 2003 the company ceased production in the UK, outsourcing its operations to India and Portugal. The cost cutting move came amid a £600,000 annual loss, which the company reversed the following year to turn a £1.5 million profit. Sales further increased by 20% to 2007.The company focuses on correctly fitting shoes to children's feet, and was the first to introduce variable width fittings for children's shoes. It once maintained concession stores in the now-defunct children's clothing retailer Adams.\nPassage 3:\nNora Lewin\nNora Lewin is a fictional character on the TV show Law & Order, played by two-time Academy Award winning actress Dianne Wiest from 2000 to 2002. She appeared in 51 episodes (48 episodes of Law & Order, one episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent and two episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit). Her character was particularly notable for the fact that she was the first woman in the program's history to hold the position of New York County District Attorney (no woman has held the position in real life). Pursuant to New York law, an interim District Attorney is appointed by the Governor.\n\nRole within Law & Order\nPrior to her appointment as interim DA, Lewin was a law professor, which often provoked her critics to dismiss her as a detached academic with no practical experience. Lewin's term as DA is defined by a liberally directed program of legal application to many notable criminal cases, which often brings her into political and legal dilemmas. While she is an idealist, however, she is not prepared to subvert the correct application of the law due to her personal beliefs. In a 2001 episode, she is confronted with the decision to pursue the death penalty in a conviction of an 18-year-old murderer. While she personally opposes the death penalty, she realizes that her office would be seen as soft on crime, and reluctantly succumbs to political pressure. The young man is found guilty and sent to death row.Lewin works closely with Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) and Abbie Carmichael (Angie Harmon). Her political beliefs often put her into conflict with both of them, especially the latter, a staunch political conservative. After Carmichael leaves the DA's office, Lewin replaces her with Serena Southerlyn (Elisabeth Röhm), whose liberal idealism more closely resembles her own political philosophy.She has a niece, indicating that she has at least one sibling.\n\nDeparture\nIn September 2002, after two years of her term as District Attorney, Lewin departs the office. The manner in which she departed the show is never specified on screen. However, in his tie-in book Law & Order: Crime Scenes, Dick Wolf wrote that his intention for the character was that Lewin found herself disenchanted with the position of D.A., and opted not to run for election following her interim term. Fred Dalton Thompson subsequently joined the cast as Republican Arthur Branch. Wiest later stated, in the book Actors at Work, written by Rosemarie Tichler and Barry Jay Kaplan, that she was tired of the role and wished to move on to other projects.\nIn her first scene, Lewin is introduced to McCoy by Mayor Rudy Giuliani (playing himself in a cameo appearance), who praises Lewin's record and assures her that she will do a fine job as District Attorney.\n\nAppearances on other TV series\nLaw & Order: Criminal Intent\nSeason One\nEpisode 1: \"One\"\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\nSeason Three\nEpisode 10: \"Ridicule\"\nSeason Four\nEpisode 1: \"Chameleon\"\nPassage 4:\nLucy Davis\nLucy Clare Davis (born 17 February 1973) is an English actress best known for playing Dawn Tinsley in the BBC comedy The Office (2001–2003). \nShe is also known for her roles as Hilda Spellman in the Netflix series The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (2018–2020), Dianne in the horror-comedy Shaun of the Dead (2004), and Etta Candy in Wonder Woman (2017). She is also currently playing the role of Eva in Disney Channel's action comedy series The Villains of Valley View, which premiered on 3 June 2022.\n\nCareer\nDavis appeared briefly in an episode of The Detectives, a show created for and starring her father (Jasper Carrott). She played Maria Lucas in the BBC's 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice, and also had a role in the 1996 Christmas special of One Foot in the Grave. After her breakthrough role as Dawn Tinsley in The Office, Davis appeared in the films Sex Lives of the Potato Men and Shaun of the Dead in 2004, whilst continuing to play Hayley Jordan in The Archers on BBC Radio 4. She gave up this last role when her other acting responsibilities made it impossible to continue, and the part was recast in September 2005.\nDavis appeared in the third-season episode \"Elephants and Hens\" of UK TV programme Black Books. Inthe death of his father that Ramesses started his reign, which would bring peace and prosperity to Egypt. The discovery of Belzoni's Tomb secures the Egyptologist's reputation and makes him a celebrity in his adopted home of London where the British Museum would later honour him.\n\nCast\nMatthew Kelly as Belzoni\nLynsey Baxter as Sarah Belzoni\nNevan Finnigan as James Curtin\nRobert Portal as Henry Salt\nRichard Dempsey as William Beechey\nThomas Lockyer as John Lewis Bukhardt\nJoseph Long as Bernardino Drovetti\n\nPart three: Champollion\nJean-François Champollion uses the Rosetta Stone to unlock the mysteries of the lost civilisation of Ancient Egypt which had been closed off to Europeans for centuries prior to the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. The stone, discovered by the French in 1799, had been created as a work of propaganda by the Greek-speaking Pharaoh Ptolemy V to establish his place in Egyptian cosmology and flashbacks are included to explain this belief system.\n\nEpisode five: The Mystery of the Rosetta Stone\nThe young Champollion, encouraged to develop his gift for languages by his elder brother, becomes obsessed with deciphering hieroglyphs as a means to telling the age of the world and revenging France against the British who had confiscated the stone in 1801. When Alexander the Great had conquered Egypt, he had fuelled local resentment by bringing in a Greek speaking elite to rule. Their descendant King Tutankhamun had commissioned a series of stones written in Greek, common Egyptian and hieroglyphs for temples across the land to extol his virtues and underline his claim to the throne.\nChampollion studies under Silvestre de Sacy in Paris but finds the professor who had himself failed decipher hieroglyphs dismissive of further attempts believing them to be symbolic rather than a true language. English scientist Thomas Young uses mathematics to decipher the inscription like a code whilst Champollion believing hieroglyphs to be representative of a spoken language attempts to relate them to the Coptic language of Egypt's ancient Christian communities. Young makes a number of breakthroughs including the spelling of Ptolemy in hieroglyphs while Champollion finds work as assistant professor at the University of Grenoble. France is thrown into political turmoil in 1815 following defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and the republican Champollion is arrested for sedition and exiled to Figeac until 1821. Eccentric Egyptologist Giovanni Belzoni discovers an obelisk inscribed with the name of Cleopatra in Greek and hieroglyphs at Philae and sends it back to Young in England.\nYoung makes a mistake in translating the obelisk setting back his work whilst Champollion using a copy of the obelisk creates a hieroglyphic alphabet that he uses along with Coptic to translate the name of Ramesses the Great from sketches of Abu Simbal. Champollion's discovery arouses the suspicions of the Catholic Church who fear hieroglyphs might disprove the historical accuracy of the Bible. Young wishes Champllion good luck in proving his theories but Sacy and the Church are determined to stop him.\n\nEpisode six: The Secrets of the Hieroglyphs\nChampollion is determined to travel to Egypt to prove his theory but poor and jobless he is reduced to buying up whatever scraps of papyrus he can find and this obsession alienates his wife. The Dendera zodiac purchased by the French King Charles X threatens to challenge the biblical chronologies of church scholars, as it is believed by some to date to before the Great Flood of 2349 BC. Champollion is called in to confirm Sacy's dating of the antiquity to around 2000 BC; he disputes Sacy's dating but not Church authorities by dating it to some 2,000 years later than that during the Roman period.\nChampollion is sent to Turin by the King to value a collection put up for sale by the French Consul to Egypt Bernardino Drovetti. Prior to his departure Champollion's wife announces that she is pregnant and she is not pleased by his new job. Champollion builds a strong reputation for himself in Italy even being invited for an audience with Pope Leo XII. Returning to Paris with a large collection of antiquities for the King he is put in charge of the Egyptian collection at the Louvre. The King finally agrees to fund Champollion's expedition to Egypt on the proviso that he does not publish any finds that contradict the teachings of the Church. Champollion, arriving in 1828, starts by studying the Great Pyramid at Giza discovering it to be a tomb built for the Pharaoh Khufu around 2560 BC. At Saqqara he finds the site largely stripped by dealers but in a forgotten tomb he discovers ancient hieroglyphs he translates to prove his theories. Eager to understand the Ancient Egyptians he pushes on to the ancient capital of Thebes where at the sprawling Temple of Karnak he reads the story of Ramesses the Great and the battle against the Hittites at Kadesh.\nAt Belzoni's Tomb in the Valley of the Kings the ailing Champollion reads the story of Pharaoh Seti I and learns of the burial rites of Pharaohs. He is thus able to comprehend the belief system of the Ancient Egyptians for the first time. Champollion dies back in France 18 months later but his legacy allows Egyptologist to comprehend the meaning behind monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and to decipher papyri that lead to such discoveries as the Tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter.\n\nCast\nElliot Cowan as Jean-François Champollion\nStuart Bunce as Jacques-Joseph Champollion\n\nMedia information\nDVD release\nReleased on Region 2 DVD by BBC Video on 2006-02-06.Also released on Region 1 DVD (2 discs, but does not include the bonus 'Pyramid') by BBC Worldwide 2006-05-23\n\nCompanion book\nThe 2005 companion book to the series was written by author and archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley expands on the series to tell the full story of the discoveries and the colourful characters who made them.\n\nSelected editions\nTyldesley, Joyce (6 October 2005).

For the second year in a row, the format had the first and second All-Star teams, with additional players on each team, play each other. After the game ended in a tie for the second year in a row, the NHL decided that they would continue with the previous format of the Stanley Cup winner playing an all-star team.\n\nThe game\nGame summary\nReferee: Bill Chadwick\nLinesmen: George Young, Doug Young\n\nRosters\nNotes\n\nCitations\nPassage 2:\n63rd National Hockey League All-Star Game\nThe 2018 National Hockey League All-Star Game took place at Amalie Arena in  Tampa, home of the Tampa Bay Lightning on January 28, 2018. Tampa last held the NHL All-Star Game in 1999. The All-Star Game was played in lieu of NHL participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics, as the NHL Board of Governors ruled against interrupting the season to send players to Pyeongchang from February 10 to 25.The Pacific All-Stars won the All-Star Game, which was in its third straight year of a four-team, 3-on-3, single elimination format, with one team representing each of the league's four divisions. Rookie Brock Boeser of the Vancouver Canucks was named the Most Valuable Player, scoring two goals with an assist. He became the first rookie to win MVP since Mario Lemieux in 1985.\n\nFormat\nThe 2018 All-Star Game again used the 3-on-3 tournament format successfully introduced in 2016, in which teams representing each of the NHL's four divisions (the Atlantic, Metropolitan, Central, and Pacific) played a single-elimination tournament, with each game consisting of two 10-minute halves played 3-on-3 and going directly to a shootout if tied after 20 minutes.In keeping with the four-team format, four separate uniforms were unveiled on January 3, one for each division.  As with the previous year, the jerseys are meant to be of high contrast against one another to avoid confusion regardless of which teams face off.  The primary colors of each jersey mirror the colors used by the event's host, the Lightning, with the Pacific division in white, the Central in black, the Atlantic in blue, and the Metropolitan in gray.  Accent colors of \"solar red\" (on the Western Conference uniforms) and \"UV yellow\" (on the Eastern Conference uniforms) are meant to evoke the \"warm, vibrant sunset tones and the energy of the Tampa Bay area.\"  The custom-designed number font also includes a pattern based on the suspension cables of the nearby Sunshine Skyway Bridge.  The uniforms also see a nod to classic 1980s All-Star uniforms in the inclusion of stars on the sleeves, one for each division.\n\nSkills Competition\nThe NHL All-Star Skills Competition took place the day before the All-Star Game on January 27, 2018, at Amalie Arena. Event winners were awarded a $25,000 prize, with new events the passing challenge and goalie save streak added to the competition. The winners were:\n\nFastest Skater – Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers, 13.454 seconds\nPuck Control Relay – Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary Flames, 24.650 seconds\nPassing Challenge – Alex Pietrangelo, St. Louis Blues, 46.610 seconds\nSave Streak – Marc-Andre Fleury, Vegas Golden Knights, 14 saves\nHardest Shot – Alexander Ovechkin, Washington Capitals, 101.3 mph\nAccuracy Shooting – Brock Boeser, Vancouver Canucks, 11.136 seconds\n\nRosters\nAs in the previous two All-Star Games, captaincy of each division was determined by a fan vote, running from December 2, 2017 until January 1, 2018.  On January 3, 2018, after a month of fan voting, the four captains were announced by the NHL. Steven Stamkos of the hosting Lightning was selected captain for the Atlantic Division. Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals was selected for the Metropolitan Division.  P. K. Subban of the Nashville Predators and Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers were selected to captain the Central and Pacific Divisions, respectively, for the second consecutive year.On January 7, Jon Cooper of the Lightning was named head coach of the Atlantic Division Team.  Joining him as coaches are Peter Laviolette of the Predators (Central), Barry Trotz of the Capitals (Metropolitan), and Gerard Gallant of the Golden Knights (Pacific).  Coaches are chosen from the team in each division with the highest points percentage through January 6, the season's halfway point: the Lightning sat at 0.744 with 61 points as the top team in the NHL, trailed by the Golden Knights at 0.725 with 58 points. The Predators, with a 0.659 percentage and 54 points, were ranked fourth while the Capitals, sitting at a 0.646 percentage for 53 points, ranked sixth overall.Full team rosters were announced on January 10, 2018. Brock Boeser, the Vancouver Canucks' first-round draft pick in 2015, was the sole rookie selected to appear in the 2018 All-Star Game. As of January 10, he led all rookies in goals and points with 22 and 40 respectively through 40 games, placing him fifth overall in goal scoring in the entire NHL.Under a week prior to the game, Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings elected to not accept his invitation. As a consequence, he was suspended for one regular season game. Mike Smith of the Flames replaced Quick and joined Marc-Andre Fleury as the goalies for the Pacific Division. As well, Taylor Hall of the New Jersey Devils was injured and replaced by Brian Boyle in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nUniforms\nAs with the previous game, the NHL used four uniquely-colored jerseys for each of the four division teams. As this was the first game with Adidas as the uniform supplier, the uniforms all featured Adidas' trademark three stripes down the sides of the jerseys, underneath the arms. The colors for each division were: blue with yellow trim, with blue pants, for the Atlantic; gray with yellow trim and black pants for the Metropolitan; black with reddish-orange trim and black pants for the Central; and white with reddish-orange trim and white pants for the Pacific. White pants had previously only been worn in the NHL by the 1974–75 Washington Capitals for a few games, and the Los Angeles Kings for the 2015 NHL Stadium Series game. The numbers on the back of the jseries of drills designed to showcase players' skills. It started with one timers, then proceeded to passing, where a single player had to complete a pass into six small nets. From there it went to the Puck Control Relay, having a participant skate through a series of cones with a puck. Another player then took on the Stick Handling drill, controlling a puck through a series of stationary pucks. The relay ended when a final player completed the Shooting Accuracy, again hitting all four targets. The two groups from Team Lidstrom finished first and third in the competition, gaining their team a total of five points. During the Hardest Shot competition reigning champion Zdeno Chara was defeated in his preliminary round match up by Shea Weber. In the final round, Chara again matched up with Weber. Chara successfully defended his title by defeating Weber with a shot registering 105.9 mph. The speed set a new SuperSkills record surpassing his own record and marking the fourth time he has won the event. Despite being down by a large margin prior to the Elimination Shootout, Team Lidstrom still had an opportunity to win the contest. Players continued to shoot provided they scored – scoring one point per goal, until only one player remained. However, the shoot-out was won by Team Staal's Corey Perry as he was the only player to score in all three of his attempts. The full results are listed below.\n\nGame play\nThe scoring started early in the game as Team Staal's Alexander Ovechkin scored the game's first goal in just 50 seconds into the first period. When he took his first shift Jeff Skinner officially became the youngest player to play in an All-Star game (18 years, 259 days) surpassing the mark set in 1984 by Steve Yzerman by eight days. By the time Claude Giroux scored, less than five minutes later, Team Staal had opened up a 4–0 lead. Team Lidstrom's Marc-Andre Fleury allowed the four goals on only nine shots while his counterpart Cam Ward stopped the first four shots he faced. The tide turned a little over halfway through the first period when Anze Kopitar scored on a backhand shot. Team Lidstrom completed the first period comeback with under four minutes left in the period when Eriksson and Matt Duchene scored 23 seconds apart to tie the game at four. Team Lidstrom finished the period scoring on four of their final ten shots.Team Staal recaptured the lead early in the second with goals by Patrick Sharp and Kris Letang. They were unable to hold the lead though as Team Lidstrom tied the game at six with a second goal from Kopitar and one by Steven Stamkos. They quickly took their first lead on a goal by Daniel Briere just 1:20 later, ending the period up 7–6.Early in the third period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, resulting in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about a minute and a half left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.\n\nSummary\nW – Tim Thomas\nL – Henrik Lundqvist\n\nKeyPlayer1 (Player2, Player3) 1:00 denotes that Player1 scored a goal after 1:00, with assists from Player2 and Player3.\nGWG denotes the game-winning goal.\nEN denotes an empty net goal\nW denotes the goaltender awarded the win.\nL denotes the goaltender assigned the loss.Source: NHL\n\nNotes\n^ A: Briere was named as a replacement for Iginla.^ B: Yandle was named as a replacement for Enstrom.^ C: Havlat was named as a replacement for Hemsky.^ D: Stastny was named as a replacement for Crosby.^ E: Skinner was named as a replacement for Malkin.^ F: McBain replaced Eberle on the rookie team.^ G: Subban was named as a replacement for Skinner who was promoted from the rookie team to the All-Star Game.^ H: Chara's shot was 105.9 mph (170.4 km/hr), a new record.\nPassage 10:\n23rd National Hockey League All-Star Game\nThe 23rd National Hockey League All-Star Game was held in the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, home of the St. Louis Blues, on January 20, 1970.

Den Nationale Scene is also one of the oldest permanent theatres in Norway.\n\nHistory\nOpened under the name Det Norske Theater in 1850,  the theatre has roots dating back to its founding on the initiative of the Norwegian violinist Ole Bull. The theatre was created to develop Norwegian playwrights. Henrik Ibsen was one of the first writers-in-residences and art-directors of the theatre and it saw the première in Norway of his first contemporary realist drama The Pillars of Society (Samfundets støtter) on 30 November 1877.The theatre was initially housed in the Komediehuset på Engen. In 1909, The National Theatre moved into the new theatre building at Engen. The current theatre building was designed by Einar Oscar Schou, and opened 19 February 1909 with a production of Erasmus Montanus by Ludvig Holberg. King Haakon VII of Norway and Queen Maud were in attendance. It soon became apparent that the building was too small. In 1913 the company bought Ekserserhuset Jonsvoll to use as a warehouse. In 1920, an extension was built to the northwest. Over the years the building has undergone major changes, extensions, renovation, restoration and stage technical modernisation. The foyer and the hall were destroyed during the Second World War, and only temporarily restored.The theatre experienced a pre-war high point during the period 1934-39 under the leadership Hans Jacob Nilsen. Especially noteworthy was the 1935 premiere of the play Vår ære og vår makt (\"Our Honor and our Power\") by Nordahl Grieg.\nIn 2001 the building was restored almost to its original shape.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nArcade (Marvel Comics)\nArcade is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in 1978's Marvel Team-Up #65, the creation of writer Chris Claremont and writer/artist John Byrne. The character is a combination of an evil genius and a hitman who carries out his assassinations via various elaborate traps, often referred to as Murderworld.\nArcade's first intended victims were Spider-Man and Captain Britain but since Arcade's Murderworld games always leave the outcome up to chance, the duo defeated Arcade and escaped with their lives. Over the years Arcade has targeted a multitude of Marvel heroes, often focusing on the X-Men and associated members of X-Factor, X-Force and Excalibur. In what is considered the \"game changer\" for Arcade, Avengers Arena, he managed to kidnap 16 superpowered teens and forced them to kill each other for survival in his latest version of Murderworld; unlike most Murderworld schemes, this endeavor yielded several casualties.\nArcade has appeared in a number of other Marvel properties outside of comic books, in X-Men: Evolution voiced by Gabe Khouth, and in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series voiced by Eric Bauza. He has also appeared as one of the main villains in a number of video games, including X-Men: Madness in Murderworld, Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Spider-Man: Edge of Time and Marvel: Avengers Alliance.\n\nPublication history\nArcade was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Arcade first appeared in Marvel Team-Up #65.The same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic Marvel UK title Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain #248).Arcade has regularly been a guest villain in the majority of Marvel comics appearances he has made throughout the years since his introduction. His earliest encounter with the X-Men team occurred in the pages of Uncanny X-Men #122–124. Some time later he would encounter the team again, this time partnered with Dr. Doom in issues #145-147. Arcade also makes an appearance in The Uncanny X-Men #197 (featuring Colossus).\n\nFictional character biography\nArcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of murder, an underground funhouse of colorful deathtraps, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an amusement park, which he has dubbed \"Murderworld\".\nArcade's back-story, up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to the present. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived much of his early life, depending on the telling, on a ranch in Texas, or in a mansion in Beverly Hills. At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, his allowance was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast estate.\nArcade became a freelance assassin, traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as an amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named Miss Locke and Mr. Chambers, he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million, he would tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his targets and then watch as they are killed by a variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.\nHowever, one of his \"gimmicks\" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him \"If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!\" Arcade laughs and replied, \"Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance.\" This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use deathtraps; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.\n\nSince his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of Spider-Man and Captain Britain, Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the X-Men, X-Factor, X-Force and Excalibur as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include Gambit and Wolverine, Colossus and Shadowcat, Iceman and Angel, Nightcrawler, Northstar, Meggan, and Dazzler,.Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included Green Goblin (Phil Urich), Hercules Johnny Blaze, Patsy Walker, Gwenpool, Iron Man and The Thing and the Micronauts.Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civilians to escape Arcade's attention alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the Crazy Gang) and discovers a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (though she is soon killed by an unrelated villain after her escape).In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tunes parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the \"Wizard of Oz\" of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, Adam X and Shatterstar, who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival; his Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, which he discovers is infested with demonic beings, destroying all the obstacles in his sight and killing what he can. He then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.Prior to a confrontation with Wolverine and Gambit, he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in\nVol. 1: The Golden Child collects Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 #1-6, 144 pages, June 2005, ISBN 978-0785115953\nVol. 2: Master of the Ring collects Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 #7-13, 176 pages, December 2005, ISBN 978-0785115960\nVol. 3: League of Losers collects Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 #14-18, 120 pages, June 2006, ISBN 978-0785119463\nVol. 4: Freedom Ring collects Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 #19-25, 168 pages, February 2007, ISBN 978-0785119906\n\nVolume 4\nMs. Marvel Team-Up collects Marvel Team-Up vol. 4 #1-6, November 2019, ISBN 978-1-302-91831-6\n\nSee also\nThe Brave and the Bold - The first DC Comics equivalent.\nDC Comics Presents - The second DC Comics equivalent.\nUltimate Marvel Team-Up - The Ultimate Marvel Universe's team-up series.\nPassage 7:\nSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up\nSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up was an ongoing comic book series published by Marvel Comics that debuted in July 2013. The series is written by Christopher Yost with artwork by a rotating team of artists including David Lopez, Paolo Rivera, and Marco Checchetto. It is meant to serve as a direct successor to Avenging Spider-Man and a spiritual successor to Marvel Team-Up, whose name it plays on. It is also meant to act as an expansion of the Superior Spider-Man brand by Marvel.\n\nFormat\nLike Marvel Team-Up and Avenging Spider-Man before it, Superior Spider-Man Team-Up features a team-up format where Spider-Man is partnered with a different character each issue. It will continue plot threads started in Avenging Spider-Man and run in tandem with Dan Slott's main Superior Spider-Man title.\n\nPublication history\nSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up was announced in April 2013 as a part of Marvel's Superior brand expansion. Christopher Yost, writer of Superior Spider-Man Team-Up, said, \"Well, in my heart when I say \"Team-Up\" for \"Superior Spider-Man,\" I probably mean \"Versus.\" In the latest \"Avenging\" issues, we've seen that he has a fairly contentious relationship with most of the heroes he's encountered. And with \"Superior Spider-Man Team Up,\" that just gets bigger. I think in issue #1, he teams up with pretty much the entire Marvel Universe\". \nAxel Alonso, Marvel's Editor-In-Chief, added \"All I can say is, they had me at the title. I grew up loving \"Marvel Team-Up.\" Bought every issue I could get my hands on. Every month Spider-Man would team up with someone new. There was even an issue where Iceman teamed up with the Human Torch. I was like, \"What the—!?\"...So it didn't take much for me to sign off on the series\".\n\nIssues\nCollected editions\nPassage 8:\nUltimate Marvel Team-Up\nUltimate Marvel Team-Up is a comic book series, published by Marvel Comics which ran for 16 issues, including a concluding Ultimate Spider-Man Super Special. It is set in one of Marvel's shared universes, the Ultimate Universe and is based on the original universe Marvel Team-Up.

It is bordered in the north by Longzhou County and in the east by Ningming County, both in Chongzuo, and in the south and west by Vietnam's Lạng Sơn Province.\nNational Route 322 comes through the city centre, as does the railway which continues on to Hanoi; a high-speed expressway, now also international, passes nearby.\nZhennan Pass, site of the Battle of Bang Bo during the Sino-French War, is now named the \"Friendship Pass\" and is considered the gateway to Vietnam.\nThere are also plans to build a high-speed railway from Nanning to the Vietnamese border.\n\nAdministration\nDemographics\nPingxiang has a population of approximately 106,400 (83.5% of the people belong to the Zhuang ethnic group, 2010).

The Friendship Pass is located in the county-level city of Pingxiang, under the administration of the city of Chongzuo. At the border, the expressway connects with North–South expressway in Vietnam. The expressway is designated G7211, and opened on 28 December 2005.The expressway is a spur of G72 Quanzhou–Nanning Expressway. The Nanning–Youyiguan Expressway branches off from its primary expressway, G72, just before the western terminus of G72 in Nanning. The entire route is also part of Asian Highway 1.\nAlong with the G7511 Qinzhou–Dongxing Expressway and G8011 Kaiyuan–Hekou Expressway, it is one of the three expressways that connect China with Vietnam.\n\nRoute\nNanning City Center\nThe Nanning–Youyiguan Expressway begins east of the city centre of Nanning, at the San'an Interchange in Qingxiu District. At this interchange, it connects to the G72 Quanzhou–Nanning Expressway, its parent expressway, as well as the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway, the G75 Lanzhou–Haikou Expressway, and the G80 Guangzhou–Kunming Expressway. It proceeds south, in a concurrency with the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway and G75 Lanzhou–Haikou Expressway, to the Liangqing South interchange in Liangqing District, passing through Yongning District on the way. At this three way interchange, the Nanning–Youyiguan Expressway and Nanning Ring Expressway continue westward while the G75 Lanzhou–Haikou Expressway branches off to the south.\nThe concurrency with the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway continues until the Gaoling Interchange in Jiangnan District, south of the city centre of Nanning, where the Nanning–Youyiguan Expressway proceeds southward, away from the city centre, while the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway continues westward.\nThis section of expressway forms the southeastern part of a ring expressway around the city centre of Nanning. The orbital expressway is designated G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway. Hence, the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway is concurrent with the Nanning–Youyiguan Expressway for this entire length, and in addition, the two expressways share exit numbers during the concurrency.\n\nNanning Airport Expressway\nThe 18.443-kilometre-long section of the Nanning–Youyiguan expressway (11.460 mi) south of the Gaoling interchange is known as the Nanning Airport Expressway. This section first opened in October 2000, and is so named because it connects the city centre with Nanning's international airport, Nanning Wuxu International Airport. As this section was built prior to the other sections, it uses different exit numbers than those employed on the rest of the expressway (in which kilometre zero is at the San'an interchange). Instead, the exit numbers reset, with the Gaoling interchange serving as kilometre zero for this section.This section of expressway is toll-free. Just south of the Gaoling interchange, all motorists must stop at a toll booth. Immediately after the toll booth, the Nahong exit provides access to and from the city centre of Nanning from the south.\nThe Nanning Airport Expressway section of the Nanning–Youyiguan expressway traverses through Jiangnan District in a southwesterly manner, ending at the Wuxu exit, where it connects to Airport Road and Nanning Wuxu International Airport.\n\nWuxu to Youyiguan\nThe final section of expressway, from the Wuxu exit to the Vietnam border, is 180.063 kilometres (111.886 mi) in length. This section of expressway is tolled from the Wuxu exit to the Pingxiang exitareas demonstrate a unique fusion of 19th and 20th-century Chinese and Western architectural styles.\n\nHistory\nDiaolou structures were built from the time of the Ming Dynasty to the early 20th century, reaching a peak during the Warlord Era in the 1920s and 1930s, with the financial aid of overseas Chinese, when there were more than three thousand of these structures. Today, approximately 1,800 diaolou remain standing, and mostly abandoned, in the village countryside of Kaiping, and approximately 500 in neighboring Taishan.  They can also occasionally be found in several other areas of Guangdong, such as Shenzhen and Dongguan.The earliest standing diaolou in Kaiping is Yinglong Lou (迎龙楼) in the village of Sanmenli (Chikan township), built by the Guan lineage during the reign of Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1522–1566). It was a massive three-storey rectangular fortress with one-meter thick walls, with little resemblance with the high tower diaolous built four centuries later.  Yinglong Lou was renovated in 1919 and is 11.4 meters high.In the late 19th century and early 20th century, because of poverty and social instabilities, Kaiping was a region of major emigration abroad, one of the \"pre-eminent sending area\" of overseas Chinese.  Diaolous built during the chaotic early 20th century were most numerous around the centers of emigration. Monies from emigrants wanting to ensure the security of their families, villages, or clan lineages were used to fund the diaolou.  Although the diaolous were built mainly as protection against forays by bandits, many of them also served as living quarters.  Some of them were built by a single family, some by several families together or by entire village communities.  Kaiping became also a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back by overseas Chinese. As a result, the villagers built their diaolou to incorporate architectural features from China and from the West.It wasn't until after 1949 when an administrative system that extended down to the small villages was created that the diaolou lost their defensive purpose and were then abandoned or converted.  Still, they stand as a tribute to overseas Chinese culture and the perseverance of the peasants of Kaiping.In 2007, UNESCO named the Kaiping Diaolou and Villages (开平碉楼与村落) a World Heritage Site. UNESCO wrote, \"...the Diaolou ... display a complex and flamboyant fusion of Chinese and Western structural and decorative forms. They reflect the significant role of émigré Kaiping people in the development of several countries in South Asia, Australasia, and North America, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the close links between overseas Kaiping and their ancestral homes. The property inscribed here consists of four groups of Diaolou, totaling some 1,800 tower houses in their village settings.\"  The four restored groups of Kaiping diaolou are in: Zilicun village (自力村) of Tangkou township (塘口镇), Sanmenli village (三门里) of Chikan township (赤坎镇), Majianglong cluster (马降龙) of Baihe township (百合镇), and Jinjiangli village (锦江里) of Xiangang township (蚬冈镇).\nThe Kaiping diaolou was the location for parts of the filming of 2010 movie Let the Bullets Fly (让子弹飞).\n\nExamples\nYinglong Lou (迎龙楼), located in the village of Sanmenli (Chikan township), was built by the Guan (关族) lineage during the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty (1522–1566). As the oldest preserved diaolou in Kaiping, it retains the primitive model of a watchtower with traditional square structure and is not influenced by western architectural styles.\nJinjiangli Diaolou Cluster (锦江里碉楼群), situated behind Jinjiangli Village (Xiangang Township) of the Huang (黄) family, includes three exquisite diaolous: Ruishi Lou, Shengfeng Lou, and Jinjiang Lou. Ruishi Diaolou, constructed in 1921, has nine floors and is the tallest diaolou in Kaiping. It features a Byzantine style roof and a Roman dome.\nMajianglong Diaolou cluster (马降龙碉楼群) is spread across five villages (Baihe township) in a bamboo forest: Yong'an and Nan'an Villages of the Huang (黄) family; Hedong, Qinglin, and Longjiang Villages of the Guan (关) family.
