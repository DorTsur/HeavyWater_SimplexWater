Most wealth managers charge an annual fee (as a % of the amount invested) for their services. This fee can range anywhere from close to zero, to 0.75% depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in, and what kind of additional services they have to offer. Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio? Large successful funds like Renaissance Technologies and Citadel can charge 3% in addition to 30% of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market.

What is it for, and why might someone want to trade or invest?[/INST]", "pred": " the stock market serves as a platform for companies to raise capital and for investors to buy and sell ownership shares in those companies. the primary function of the stock market is to provide a mechanism for companies to access the capital they need to grow and expand their businesses, while allowing investors to participate in the financial success of those companies.\n\nwhen a company wants to raise capital, it can issue new shares of stock to the public through an initial public offering (ipo). this allows the company to tap into the pool of investment capital available in the stock market. the money raised from the ipo is used by the company for a variety of purposes, such as financing new product development, expanding into new markets, or paying off debt.\n\ninvestors, on the other hand, can benefit from trading or investing in the stock market in several ways. by buying shares of stock in a company, investors become part-owners of that company and have a stake in its financial success. if the company's stock price increases over time, investors can sell their shares for a profit. conversely, if the company's stock price declines, investors can sell their shares at a loss.\n\ntrading in the stock market can also provide opportunities for speculation and income generation. investors can buy and sell shares based on their expectations of the company's future performance", "answers": ["In finance, form is function, and while a reason for a trade could be anything, but since the result of a trade is a change in value, it could be presumed that one seeks to receive a change in value.

This means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price. For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses. For securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop-limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market, but you may end up stuck with shares you don't want for longer than originally planned.

How does it work?[/INST]", "pred": " yes, another tax loss can be used to offset capital gains taxes in the united states. this is known as \"utilizing a tax loss carryforward.\"\n\nwhen a taxpayer experiences a net loss on their investments, they can deduct that loss from their taxable income in the current year. any unused portion of the loss can be carried forward to future years, where it can be used to offset capital gains in those years.\n\nto illustrate how this works, let's say you had a net loss of $10,000 on your investments in year 1, and you carried that loss forward to year 2. if you had a capital gain of $5,000 in year 2, you could use the $10,000 carryforward to offset the gain, effectively reducing your tax liability by $5,000.\n\nit's important to note that there are limits on how much of a tax loss can be carried forward. for individual taxpayers, the amount that can be carried forward is the lesser of $3,000 or the amount of the excess loss. for married couples filing jointly, the carryforward limit is $1.5 million.\n\nadditionally, it's worth noting that tax loss carryforwards can have a time limit. the irs requires that the loss be carried forward and", "answers": ["Capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods. An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss.

When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040.
