It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends.

For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses.

[/INST]", "pred": " capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than normal income because the government aims to encourage investment and economic growth by providing incentives to investors. the lower tax rate on capital gains is intended to reward investors for taking risks and investing in assets that have the potential to appreciate in value over time.\n\nthere are several reasons why capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than normal income:\n\n1. encouraging investment: by taxing capital gains at a lower rate, investors are more likely to invest their money in productive assets, such as stocks, real estate, or businesses, which can help stimulate economic growth.\n2. promoting job creation: investment in businesses and start-ups can lead to the creation of new jobs, which can help reduce unemployment and promote economic growth.\n3. reducing tax evasion: by taxing capital gains at a lower rate, the government can reduce the incentive for individuals to evade taxes by hiding their income or investing in assets that are not subject to capital gains tax.\n4. simplifying tax code: taxing capital gains at a lower rate can simplify the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets and deductions that apply to normal income.\n5. historical reasons: the lower tax rate on capital gains has its roots in the early 20th century, when the united states was seeking to promote economic growth following the great depression. the revenue act of 1921 introduced a lower tax rate on long-term capital gains, and this rate has generally been retained since then.\n\nin summary, the lower tax rate on capital gains is intended to encourage investment, promote job creation, reduce tax evasion, simplify the tax code, and follow historical precedent. however, it's worth noting that the tax rate on capital gains can vary depending on the type of investment, the length of time the investment is held, and other factors.", "answers": ["There are many reasons, which other answers have already discussed. I want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons, which is that it avoids double taxation, especially on corporate earnings.  Generally, for corporations, its earnings are already taxed at around 40% (for the US - including State income taxes). When dividends are distributed out, it is taxed again at the individual level. The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%! Many people invest in stock, including mutual funds, and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates. Individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason. However, the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes, or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 298.0}

A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

Since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well, both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock.  Essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position. If the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating, or reducing, the loss made on the short sale.

It's only the mechanics that can be different. A convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond - it (usually) pays periodic interest and has a face value that's due at maturity. The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.  There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity (number of shares) that the bond can be converted into.  If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.  Rather than specifying a specific number of shares, the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market.

[/INST]", "pred": " great, i'd be happy to help you understand how your home loan works!\n\na home loan is a type of mortgage loan that a borrower uses to purchase a home. when you take out a home loan, you borrow a lump sum of money from a lender, which you then repay over a set period of time, along with interest. the interest rate on a home loan is typically decided by the lender and may vary depending on market conditions.\n\nthe amount of money that comes from the bank and goes back in the form of mortgage payments is determined by several factors, including the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n\nloan amount: this is the amount of money that you borrow from the lender to purchase your home. the loan amount is typically based on the purchase price of the property, and may include additional costs such as closing fees and other expenses.\n\ninterest rate: this is the percentage rate at which you borrow money from the lender, and the amount you pay in interest over the life of the loan. the interest rate is typically set by the lender and may vary depending on market conditions.\n\nloan term: this is the length of time that you have to repay the loan, typically ranging from 15 to 30 years.\n\nmortgage payments: based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, the lender will calculate how much you need to pay each month to repay the loan. this amount is typically divided into two parts: the interest payment and the principal payment. the interest payment is the amount of money that you pay to the lender as interest, and the principal payment is the amount of money that goes towards reducing the outstanding balance of the loan.\n\nto give you a better idea of how this works, let's use an example:\n\nsuppose you take out a $200,000 home loan with an interest rate of 4% over 30 years. your lender calculates that you need to pay $1,035.52 each month in mortgage payments, which includes $789.01 in interest and $246.51 in principal. over the life of the loan, you will pay a total of $69,669.43 in interest and $130,330.57 in principal, for a total of $199,999.96", "answers": ["Ditto mhoran_psprep.  I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Where does the money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank. If you're thinking, \"Wow, I'm paying back a whole lot more than I borrowed\", well, yes. But remember you're borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years.

A gilt with 8.75% yield and close to its redemption date may have been issued at a time when interest rates were indeed close to 8.75%. For example in the early 1990s, the UK inflation rate was about 8%. One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with financial knowledge within 300 words:\n\nWhat's the catch with biweekly mortgage payments?[/INST]", "pred": " biweekly mortgage payments are a popular option for homeowners looking to save money on their monthly mortgage payments. the idea behind biweekly payments is that instead of making one monthly payment, you make a half payment every two weeks. this frequency results in 26 payments per year, which can help homeowners pay off their mortgage faster and save on interest over the life of the loan.\n\nhowever, there are a few potential catches to consider when it comes to biweekly mortgage payments:\n\n1. penalty for early payment: some mortgage loan agreements may come with a penalty for making extra payments, including biweekly payments. be sure to check your loan agreement to see if there are any penalties associated with making additional payments.\n2. may not always save money: while biweekly payments can help homeowners pay off their mortgage faster, they may not always result in significant savings on interest. this is because the extra payments are spread out over the course of the year, rather than being applied directly to the principal balance of the loan.\n3. higher fees: some mortgage servicers may charge higher fees for biweekly payments, which can offset the benefits of making extra payments. be sure to check the fees associated with biweekly payments before setting up this payment schedule.\n4. may affect credit score: making biweekly payments can help improve your credit score, but it's important to make sure you have a good payment history before implementing this strategy. missed payments or late payments can negatively impact your credit score, so be sure to make all of your payments on time.\n5. not suitable for all loans: biweekly payments may not be suitable for all types of mortgage loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or interest-only loans. be sure to check your loan agreement to see if biweekly payments are allowed.\n\nin summary, biweekly mortgage payments can be a useful strategy for homeowners looking to pay off their mortgage faster and save on interest. however, it's important to carefully consider the potential catches and limitations of this payment schedule before implementing it. be sure to review your loan agreement and consult with a financial advisor to determine if biweekly payments are the right choice for you.", "answers": ["Depending on who you have the loan through and how they figure the interest charges (whether daily, monthly, bi-monthly, etc. normally monthly I would assume), your interest is probably figured either daily or once a month.   Let's assume that it is figured daily, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to make bi-weekly payments.   At 4% Annual Interest on a $150,000 home loan the interested added each day is about $16.44, but it doesn't stop there because it is compounding interest daily so the next day it becomes 4% of 150,0016.44 (which is negligibly larger amount) and they will tack on another $16.44. So what will happen is that the amount of interest you owe grows rather quickly, especially if you miss a monthly payment.  Everyone knows that the faster you pay something off the less interest you pay, but not everyone knows the formula for compounding interest.  a quick Google search rendered this site with a simple explanation Compound Interest Formula  unfortunately this formula doesn't take into account the payments being made. The big thing with making your payments bi-weekly rather than a bigger payment once a month is that you pay off some of that principle right away and it won't collect interest for 14 more days. if the interest is only calculated once a month, make your full payment before the interest is calculated, the same goes for your credit cards."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 274.0}

If house A costs $1M and you'll make $50K (profit) from it yearly, and house B costs $1.33M and you'll make $65K (profit) from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount-of-money-you-have-stuck-in-this-investment-and-unavailable-for-use-elsewhere.

This is because checks are not always instantly withdrawn from the other account (although this is becoming much more common post-electronic check reform), so the bank wants to make sure it actually is getting the money from the check; after all, if the check you deposited bounces, the bank doesn't want to end up footing the bill. The bank allows you some portion up front, largely as a customer service; the amount varies from bank to bank, but it's generally a small amount they don't mind risking.  $200 is a pretty good amount, actually; back when I was just out of college and frequently spending the last $50 in my account, the pre-clearance amount was usually $50.

By offering a joint checking/savings account that requires you to use your debit card, the bank is assuming that you'll keep more money in your account than you would in a standard checking-only account.

The gist of all this is that the seller of the vehicle mentioned does not have clear title if there is a lien.  This introduces a risk for the buyer.  The buyer can pay the seller the money to cover the lien (in the case of a bank loan) but that doesn't mean the seller will actually pay off the loan (so the title is never clear!).  This article recommends visiting the bank with the seller, and getting title on-the-spot.  However, this isn't always an option, as a local bank branch isn't probably going to have the title document available, though the seller might be able to make some arrangement for a local branch to have the title available before a visit to pay off the loan.

This is only a generalization, not specific goodswise, which would require a more detailed ananlysis. But investors have a different dilemma. Canadian investors would find  it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada. While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else.  Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates, if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada. But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict, because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do.

European Options expire at their due date, but American Options expire at their due date or at any time before their due date if the holder decides they expire. With American Options, if a holder of an American Option decides to exercise the option, someone who is short the same option will be assigned as the counterparty (this is usually random). Expiry is after market close, so if one of your short American Options expires early, you will need to reopen the position the next day. Keep in mind dividends for slightly increased complexity.
