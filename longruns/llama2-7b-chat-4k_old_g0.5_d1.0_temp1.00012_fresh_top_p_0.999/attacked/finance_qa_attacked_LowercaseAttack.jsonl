I did confirm that the SEC filing for MSFT does include the GAAP number, not the non-GAAP number (as you'd expect). I will also note that it looks like the 10Q is not the only source of information.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with financial knowledge within 300 words:\n\nWhy are capital gains taxed at a lower rate than normal income? [/INST]", "pred": " capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than normal income because the government aims to encourage investment and economic growth by providing incentives for investors to hold and sell assets that have increased in value over time. the lower tax rate on capital gains is meant to balance the potential revenue loss with the benefits of investment and economic growth.\n\nthere are several reasons why capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than normal income:\n\n1. investment and economic growth: by taxing capital gains at a lower rate, investors are incentivized to reinvest their gains in new investments, which can stimulate economic growth and job creation.\n2. encouraging long-term investment: capital gains taxed at a lower rate can be held for longer periods of time, as investors are more likely to hold onto assets that will be subject to lower tax rates.\n3. reducing the burden on small businesses and farmers: capital gains taxed at a lower rate can help small businesses and farmers, who often have limited financial resources and rely on the appreciation of assets to fund their operations.\n4. promoting fairness: capital gains taxed at a lower rate can be seen as more fair than taxing income from hard work and labor at the same rate as income from investments. investors are taking on risk and making investments that can create jobs and grow the economy, and they should be rewarded with a lower tax rate.\n5. historical reasons: the lower tax rate on capital gains has its roots in the revenue act of 1921, which established a separate tax rate for short-term capital gains (those held for one year or less) and a lower rate for long-term capital gains (those held for more than one year).\n\nit's worth noting that the tax rates on capital gains can vary depending on the taxpayer's tax bracket and the type of asset sold. for example, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains is currently 20%, while the maximum tax rate on short-term capital gains is the same as the taxpayer's ordinary income tax rate. additionally, some taxpayers may be eligible for additional tax benefits on capital gains, such as the 0% tax rate on capital gains from the sale of qualified small business stock.", "answers": ["There are many reasons, which other answers have already discussed. I want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons, which is that it avoids double taxation, especially on corporate earnings.  Generally, for corporations, its earnings are already taxed at around 40% (for the US - including State income taxes). When dividends are distributed out, it is taxed again at the individual level. The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. (I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US.) For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns $1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of $600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to $600,000 getting taxed at another 20%~30% or so at the individual level (depending on the State). If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50%! Many people invest in stock, including mutual funds, and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates. Individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason. However, the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes, or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 298.0}

A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying \"but don't sell for less than my limit price\".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say)."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 299.0}

The convertible instruments will tend to move in about the same direction as the underlying (what it can be converted to) but less violently as they are traded less (lower volatility and lower volume in the market on both sides), however, they are not being used to make a profit so much as to hedge against the stock going up. Since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well, both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock.  Essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position. If the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating, or reducing, the loss made on the short sale. Effectively the profit here is made on the spread between the price of the bond, accounting for the conversion price, and the price of the stock and that fixed income is less volatile (except usually in the junk market) than stock."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 290.0}

It's only the mechanics that can be different. A convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond - it (usually) pays periodic interest and has a face value that's due at maturity. The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.  There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity (number of shares) that the bond can be converted into.  If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.  Rather than specifying a specific number of shares, the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market.

When APs sense   demand for additional shares of an ETF—which manifests itself when the   ETF share price trades at a premium to its NAV—they go into the market   and create new shares. When the APs sense demand from investors   looking to redeem—which manifests itself when the ETF share price   trades at a discount—they process redemptions. So, suppose the NAV of the ETF is $20/share and the trading price is $30/share. The AP can buy the underlying securities for $20/share in a bulk order that equates to 50,000 shares of the ETF and exchange the underlying shares for new shares in the ETF. Then the AP can turn around and sell those new ETF shares for $30/share and pocket the gain. If you switch the prices around, the AP would then take the ETF shares and exchange them for the underlying securities in the same way and make a profit on the difference.

I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Where does the money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank.

One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don't need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the \"government guaranteed\" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with financial knowledge within 300 words:\n\nWhat's the catch with biweekly mortgage payments?[/INST]", "pred": " biweekly mortgage payments, also known as biweekly mortgage repayment, are payments made every two weeks instead of the traditional monthly payments. many homeowners and potential homeowners are drawn to biweekly mortgage payments because they can potentially save money on interest and pay off their mortgages faster. however, there are some catches to consider when using biweekly mortgage payments:\n\n1. the interest rate is the same: one of the most significant advantages of biweekly mortgage payments is that the interest rate is the same as a traditional mortgage. this means that you don't get a better interest rate by making biweekly payments.\n2. it may not save you money: although biweekly mortgage payments can help you pay off your mortgage faster, they may not necessarily save you money. this is because some mortgage calculators may not account for the extra payment amounts made with biweekly payments. so, it's crucial to run the numbers and see if biweekly payments will indeed save you money in the long run.\n3. there may be penalties for early payment: some mortgage lenders may charge penalties for making extra payments, including biweekly payments. so, it's essential to check the fine print of your mortgage agreement to avoid any potential penalties.\n4. the payments may not be equally split: depending on your mortgage schedule, your biweekly payments may not be equally split between interest and principal. this can result in some payments going solely towards interest, while others go towards the principal.\n5. it may impact your tax deductions: if you're making biweekly payments, you may not be able to deduct the full amount of interest paid on your taxes. this is because the irs caps the deductibility of mortgage interest at $750,000 for single filers and $1.5 million for joint filers.\n6. it may affect your credit score: making biweekly payments can slightly impact your credit score, as it may increase your credit utilization ratio. however, the impact is typically minor and temporary.\n7. there may be alternative options: depending on your financial situation, there may be alternative options that can help you pay off your mortgage faster, such as making one extra payment per year or using a mortgage payoff calculator.\n\nin conclusion, while bi", "answers": ["Depending on who you have the loan through and how they figure the interest charges (whether daily, monthly, bi-monthly, etc. normally monthly I would assume), your interest is probably figured either daily or once a month.   Let's assume that it is figured daily, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to make bi-weekly payments.   At 4% Annual Interest on a $150,000 home loan the interested added each day is about $16.44, but it doesn't stop there because it is compounding interest daily so the next day it becomes 4% of 150,0016.44 (which is negligibly larger amount) and they will tack on another $16.44. So what will happen is that the amount of interest you owe grows rather quickly, especially if you miss a monthly payment.  Everyone knows that the faster you pay something off the less interest you pay, but not everyone knows the formula for compounding interest.  a quick Google search rendered this site with a simple explanation Compound Interest Formula  unfortunately this formula doesn't take into account the payments being made. The big thing with making your payments bi-weekly rather than a bigger payment once a month is that you pay off some of that principle right away and it won't collect interest for 14 more days. if the interest is only calculated once a month, make your full payment before the interest is calculated, the same goes for your credit cards."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 274.0}

The bank allows you some portion up front, largely as a customer service; the amount varies from bank to bank, but it's generally a small amount they don't mind risking.  $200 is a pretty good amount, actually; back when I was just out of college and frequently spending the last $50 in my account, the pre-clearance amount was usually $50. If the bank does this to you regularly and you feel that it is unfair in how long it holds checks, you might consider shopping around; different banks have different hold policies, or might allow you a larger amount up front.

The firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome (plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market).  The cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite, matching bet (in this way, brokers are following market price, while traders are setting it). Financially, options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying, and they can be made directly with the opposite bettor or with a neutral dealer."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 260.0}

Such offers are also very closely watched by the SEC; if there's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner, or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves, the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of SEC and DoJ legal proceedings."], "all_classes": "null", "length": 255.0}

Jokes aside though, an economic bubble occurs when the economy is in bull market mode and asset prices are growing very fast. It's usually measured by ratio's like price to earnings and the levels of various market indices. So, the opposite would be when valuations are falling very fast or are very low, and price to earnings ratios are low.  This condition is usually a recession. A recession is a market slowdown, generally after a bubble bursts, and severe recessions can become depressions if they last long enough (Great Depression, 1930s).  A bubble is not necessarily negative - stock prices usually rise a lot so paper wealth is greatly magnified. If you can get out in time, you're golden. Similarly, a recession isn't bad for everyone. Some investors keep large amounts of cash waiting for recessions so they can \"buy low, sell high\". For most people, however, recessions are negative because unemployment increases and some people get fired, and the economy slows down.

If your credit limit matches your monthly income, and if you pay off your card each month, I think it is harder to overspend as you don't have more credit available than you can afford to spend.

How do I approach this?[/INST]", "pred": " when considering split buying a house with multiple individuals, there are several factors to take into account. here are some steps you can follow to approach this situation:\n\n1. define your split: determine how you want to split the costs of the house. you may want to consider using a percentage-based split, where each individual pays a percentage of the total costs based on their contribution. alternatively, you could use a fixed-price split, where each individual pays a fixed amount towards the purchase.\n2. establish a budget: determine how much each individual can afford to contribute towards the purchase of the house. consider factors such as income, savings, debt, and other financial obligations.\n3. consider financing options: if you are unable to afford the full cost of the house on your own, you may want to consider financing options such as a mortgage. there are different types of mortgages available, including shared equity mortgages, which allow multiple individuals to share ownership and repayment of the loan.\n4. create a joint ownership structure: determine the ownership structure of the property. this can be a complex issue, as you will need to consider factors such as taxation, insurance, and future ownership rights. it may be beneficial to consult with a lawyer or financial advisor to determine the best ownership structure for your situation.\n5. consider the future: think about your future plans and how they may impact your ownership of the house. for example, if one of the individuals is unable to continue making payments, how will the other individuals be affected? it may be beneficial to have a contingency plan in place to address any potential issues that may arise.\n6. legal considerations: depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, you may need to sign a formal agreement or deed outlining the split purchase of the house. this can help to protect the interests of all parties involved and prevent any potential disputes in the future.\n\nin conclusion, split buying a house with multiple individuals can be a complex process, but with careful planning and consideration, it is possible to successfully navigate this situation. by defining your split, establishing a budget, considering financing options, creating a joint ownership structure, thinking about the future, and considering legal considerations, you can ensure that everyone involved is protected and satisfied with the arrangement.", "answers": ["I would second the advice to not do this. Real estate ownership is complex to begin with, involving a constant stream of maintenance, financing, and other decisions.  It is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit (a couple), but at least spouses are forced to compromise. Friends are not, and you can end up with long-running conflicts and impasses. Financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships, and friendships are no exception. If you want your friendship to survivie, do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment. My advice would be to steer clear, no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look. Focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property. But it will be 100% yours, and will save tons of headache. Since you are still considering this deal, it's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away - believe me, a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration.

{"prompt": "[INST]You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following question with financial knowledge within 300 words:\n\nHow does investing in commodities/futures vary from stocks?[/INST]", "pred": " investing in commodities and futures differ from stocks in several ways. here are some key differences:\n\n1. type of asset: commodities are physical goods, such as gold, oil, and wheat, while stocks represent ownership in companies. futures are contracts to buy or sell a specific asset at a future date, which are often used to hedge against price movements in the underlying asset.\n2. price volatility: commodities and futures prices can be more volatile than stock prices due to various factors such as supply and demand imbalances, geopolitical events, and weather conditions. this volatility can result in higher potential returns but also higher risk.\n3. trading hours: commodities and futures markets are often traded 24/5, while stock markets have limited trading hours. this means that investors can buy and sell commodities and futures contracts at any time, but they may not be able to do so with stocks outside of regular trading hours.\n4. leverage: futures trading typically offers higher leverage than stock trading, which means that investors can control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. this higher leverage can result in greater potential returns but also increases the risk of losses.\n5. margins: investors must deposit a margin, or a portion of the contract value, to buy or sell commodities or futures. this requirement is typically lower for stocks than for futures.\n6. speculation: commodities and futures are often used for speculation, as investors can buy and sell contracts hoping to profit from price movements without actually owning the underlying asset. this is less common in stock markets, where investors typically buy and hold shares for the long term.\n7. diversification: investing in commodities and futures can provide a different diversification benefit than investing in stocks. commodities can help reduce overall portfolio risk by providing a negative correlation with stocks, while futures can offer a way to gain exposure to markets that are not directly correlated with stocks.\n\nin summary, investing in commodities and futures has its unique characteristics compared to stocks. while they offer potential for higher returns, they also come with higher risk and volatility due to various factors. therefore, it is essential to understand these differences and develop a well-thought-out investment strategy before investing in these markets.", "answers": ["As Dilip has pointed out in the comment, investing in commodities is to either delivery or Buy.

If in November, the price is lower than your contract price, you have an option to sell it at loss. If you don't want to sell it at loss, you are supposed to take the physical shipment [arrange for your own transport] and store it in warehouse. Although there are companies that will allow you to lease their warehouse, it very soon becomes more loss making proposition. By doing this you can HOLD onto as long as you want [or as long as the good survive and don't rot] It makes sense for a large wholesaler to enter into Buy contracts as he would be like to get known prices for at least half the stock he needs.
